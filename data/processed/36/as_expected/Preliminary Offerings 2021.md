The offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is for
distribution only to, and is directed only at, persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments (being investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets

falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the
Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully
be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The securities described in the attached offering**
memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129
(as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

The attached offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of securities in any
Member State of the EEA that is subject to the Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities.

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The securities described in the attached offering**
memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the
“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs
Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and,
therefore, offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

The attached offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in the UK
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
securities. The attached offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

**MiFID II Product Governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the**
purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of the

securities described in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such
securities is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and
(ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should
take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the such securities is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as
defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to the FCA Handbook Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation,

provider will be subject to certain limitations. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability
_of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The security interests in favor of the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released under_

affiliates, advisers and agents in connection with your investigation of the accuracy of this information or your
decision whether to invest in the Notes. The Initial Purchasers disclaim all and any liability whether arising in
tort, contract or otherwise which they may otherwise have in relation to this offering memorandum or any
information contained herein. The Initial Purchasers do not undertake to review the financial condition or affairs
of the Issuer or any Guarantor during the life of the Notes or to advise any investor or potential investor in the
Notes of any information coming to the attention of any Initial Purchaser. Nothing contained in this Offering
Memorandum is, or shall be relied upon as, a promise or representation by any of the Initial Purchasers as to the
past or future.

We reserve the right to withdraw the Offering at any time. We and the Initial Purchasers each reserve the
right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part and to allot to any prospective purchaser less
than the amount of the Notes sought by it. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their respective related entities
may acquire, for their own accounts, a portion of the Notes.

This offering memorandum is a confidential document that we are providing only to prospective purchasers
of the Notes and has only been prepared in connection with the Offering. You must not make copies of any part
of this offering memorandum or give a copy of it to any other person, or disclose any information in this offering
memorandum to any other person.

By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you agree to the foregoing and agree not to use any
information herein for any purpose other than considering an investment in the Notes. This offering
memorandum may be used only for the purpose for which it was published.

The Notes will be available in book-entry form only. The Issuer expects that the Notes offered and sold in
the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance upon Rule 144A will initially be represented by
beneficial interests in one or more permanent global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more
global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and together
with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be deposited
upon issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The information set out in relation to sections of this offering memorandum describing clearing and
settlement arrangements, including the section entitled “Book Entry, Delivery and Form,” is subject to any
change in or reinterpretation of the rules, regulations and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream currently in
effect. We will not, nor will any of our agents, have responsibility for the performance of the respective
obligations of Euroclear and Clearstream or their respective participants under the rules and procedures
governing their operations, nor will we or our agents have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to, or payments made on account of, book entry interests held through the facilities of any
clearing system or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to these book entry interests.
Investors wishing to use these clearing systems are advised to confirm the continued applicability of their rules,
regulations and procedures.

There is currently no market for the Notes. Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes

will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that
such listing will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing.

None of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any other
regulatory authority has reviewed or approved or disapproved of the Notes or the Note Guarantees, and none of
the foregoing authorities have passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Offering or the accuracy or adequacy of
this offering memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense under the laws of the United
States and could be a criminal offense in certain other jurisdictions.

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in this offering memorandum under “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes
have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United
States and are subject to certain restrictions on transfer. Prospective purchasers are hereby notified that the seller
of any Note may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by
Rule 144A. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Notes, see “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

**Canada**

This offering memorandum constitutes an “exempt offering document” as defined in and for the purposes of
applicable Canadian securities laws. No prospectus has been filed with any securities commission or similar
regulatory authority in Canada in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes. No securities commission or
similar regulatory authority in Canada has reviewed or in any way passed upon this document or on the merits of
the Notes and any representation to the contrary is an offence.

The Notes may be sold only to Canadian purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal
that are “accredited investors,” as such term is defined in Section 1.1 of National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus
Exemptions or, in Ontario, as such term is defined in Section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are
“permitted clients,” as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 31-103 Registration
Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Each Canadian purchaser who purchases the
Notes will be deemed to have represented to the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and to each dealer from whom a
purchase confirmation is received, as applicable, that the purchaser (i) is purchasing as principal, or is deemed to
be purchasing as principal in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, for investment only and not
with a view to resale or redistribution; (ii) is an “accredited investor”; and (iii) is a “permitted client.”

Any resale of Notes acquired by a Canadian purchaser in the Offering must be made in accordance with
applicable Canadian securities laws, which may vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction, and which may
require resales to be made in accordance with Canadian prospectus requirements, a statutory exemption from the
prospectus requirements, in a transaction exempt from the prospectus requirements or otherwise under a
discretionary exemption from the prospectus requirements granted by the applicable local Canadian securities
regulatory authority. These resale restrictions may under certain circumstances apply to resales of the Notes
outside of Canada.

iv


-----

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should
refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for
particulars of these rights, or consult with a legal advisor.

Canadian purchasers are advised that this document has been prepared in reliance on Section 3A.3 of
National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”). Pursuant to section 3A.3 of NI 33-105, this
document is exempt from the requirement that the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers in the Offering provide
Canadian purchasers with certain conflicts of interest disclosure pertaining to “connected issuer” and/or “related
issuer” relationships as would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 2.1(1) of NI 33-105.

Upon receipt of this offering memorandum, each Canadian purchaser hereby confirms that it has expressly
requested that all documents evidencing or relating in any way to the sale of the Notes described herein
(including for greater certainty any purchase confirmation or any notice) be drawn up in the English language
only. Par la réception de ce document, chaque investisseur Canadien confirme par les présentes qu’il a
_expressément exigé que tous les documents faisant foi ou se rapportant de quelque manière que ce soit à la vente_
_des valeurs mobilières décrites aux présentes (incluant, pour plus de certitude, toute confirmation d’achat ou_

**European Economic Area**

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129
(as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of
the EEA that is subject to the Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities.

**_MiFID II Product Governance_**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties
(“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the
Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**United Kingdom**

This offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is
for distribution only to, and is directed only at, persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating
to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion)
Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d)
(“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside
the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
(within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) in connection
with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all

v


-----

such persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons”). This offering memorandum is directed only at
Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not Relevant Persons. Any
investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is permitted only by Relevant
Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.

No part of this offering memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or otherwise made
available in whole or in part to any other person. No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA)
received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1)
of the FSMA does not apply to us.

**_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the
“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK
has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities.
This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**_UK MiFIR Product Governance_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the such securities is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as
defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to the FCA Handbook Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The offering memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer, or the
Guarantors (as defined in the offering memorandum), nor any of the respective directors, officers, employees,
agents or affiliates of the foregoing entities or persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in
respect of any difference between the offering memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and the hard
copy version available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

**Luxembourg**

This offering memorandum has not been approved by and will not be submitted for approval to the
Luxembourg financial sector supervisory authority (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier) in its
capacity as competent authority under the Prospectus Regulation and the Luxembourg law of 16 July 2019 on
prospectuses for securities (the “Luxembourg Prospectus Law”) for purposes of public offering or sale of the
Notes in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold to the public in the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other
offering memorandum, circular, prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other material may be
distributed, or otherwise made available in or from, or published in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg except in

vi


-----

circumstances where the offer benefits from an exemption to or constitutes a transaction otherwise not subject to
the requirements to publish a prospectus, in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation and the Luxembourg
Prospectus Law.

**Germany**

The Offering is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Notes may not be offered and
sold in the Federal Republic of Germany except in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Prospectus
Act of the Federal Republic of Germany (Wertpapierprospektgesetz) (as amended, the “German Securities
Prospectus Act”), the Prospectus Regulation and any other laws applicable in Germany. This offering
memorandum has not been and will not be submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be approved by, the German
Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (“BaFin”). BaFin has
not obtained and will not obtain a notification from another competent authority of a member state of the
European Union (each a Member State), with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to
Article 25 of the Prospectus Regulation. The Notes must not be distributed within Germany by way of a public
offer, public advertisement or in any similar manner, and this offering memorandum and any other document
relating to the Notes, as well as information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in Germany or
used in connection with any offer for subscription of Notes to the public in Germany. Consequently, in Germany
the Notes will only be available to, and this offering memorandum and any other offering material in relation to
the Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of
Section 2 No. 3 of the German Securities Prospectus Act in connection with Article 2 lit. e of the Prospectus
Regulation. Any resale of the Notes in Germany may only be made in accordance with the German Securities
Prospectus Act, the Prospectus Regulation and other applicable laws.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains forward-looking statements, including statements about market
consolidation and our strategy, investment program, future operations, prospects, growth, goals, targets, industry
forecasts, expected acquisitions, transactions and investments, and target levels of liquidity, leverage and
indebtedness. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future
events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions,
assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as “aim,”
“anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend,”
“may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” or similar
words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the
absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and are
based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those
expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in “Risk Factors.”
In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this
offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in
subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results
include, but are not limited to:

   - the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic;

   - our dependence on the image and reputation of the Birkenstock brand;

   - our dependence on third parties for our sales and distribution channels;

   - risks related to the conversion of wholesale distribution markets to owned and operated markets and
risks related to productivity or efficiency initiatives;

   - economic conditions impacting consumer spending;

   - intense competition from both established companies and newer entrants;

   - operational challenges relating to the distribution of our products;

   - deterioration or termination of relationships with major wholesale partners;

   - changes in tariffs and foreign trade policy;

   - adverse events influencing the sustainability of our supply chain or our relationships with major
suppliers, or increases in raw materials costs;

   - failure to execute our direct-to-consumer growth strategy;

   - risks related to seasonality, atypical weather conditions and climate change;

   - our ability to effectively manage inventory;

   - risks associated with international markets;

   - risks relating to our intellectual property rights;

   - our ability to adapt to changes in consumer preferences;

   - failure to increase or enhance marketing activities;

   - inability to successfully operate retail stores;

   - risks relating to non-footwear products;

   - failure to attract and retain key employees and deterioration of relationships with employees;

   - currency exchange rate fluctuations;

   - unforeseen business interruptions and other operational problems at our production facility;

   - reliance on service arrangements with third parties;

   - risks relating to regulations governing the use and processing of personal data;

viii


-----

   - risks related to changes in and compliance with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption
regulations and economic sanctions programs, by us and our supplies, agents and distributors;

   - incidents at productions sites and distribution centers;

   - disruption and security breaches affecting information technology systems;

   - tax-related risks;

   - risks of litigation and other claims;

   - inadequate insurance coverage, or increased insurance costs;

   - natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, civil unrest and other catastrophic events beyond
control;

   - losses and liabilities arising from leased real estate;

   - impairment of goodwill as a result of revaluations;

   - uncertainty surrounding Brexit;

   - risks related to the Transactions, our capital structure, indebtedness and the Notes; and

   - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.”

These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that
could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity and developments in the markets
and industries in which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to
predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any
risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained
in any forward-looking statements.

Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of
actual results. We urge you to read this entire offering memorandum, including the sections entitled, “Risk
_Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,_
“Industry” and “Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance
and the industry in which we operate.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this offering memorandum, and we do not
intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set out in this offering
memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us
or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this offering memorandum.
As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Certain information used in this offering memorandum contains statistical data, estimates and forecasts
concerning the industry in which we operate that are based on external service providers (for which data is not
publicly available), other publicly available information (including McKinsey’s “Survey: Consumer sentiment on
_sustainability in fashion”) and independent industry publications, including those published by Euromonitor_
International Limited (“Euromonitor”), as well as our internal sources and general knowledge of, and
expectations concerning, the industry.

Some of the information herein has also been extrapolated from market data, reports, surveys and studies
using our experience and internal estimates. Elsewhere in this offering memorandum, statements regarding the
industry in which we operate, our position in this industry and the size of certain markets are based solely on our
experience, internal studies, estimates and surveys, and our own investigation of market conditions.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers accepts responsibility for the factual correctness
of any such statistics or information obtained from third parties.

While the Issuer believes this information to be reliable, it has not been independently verified, and we do
not make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this
offering memorandum. In addition, we believe that data regarding the industry and industry market and sales
positions, shares, market sizes and growth provide general guidance but are inherently imprecise. Furthermore,
certain forward-looking statements contained in such industry and market data may include the impact of the

ix


-----

COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, but may have not been updated to take into account further outbreaks of
COVID-19 or other related developments, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other
measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. There can be no assurance that such forward-looking
statements would not have been materially different if such developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic
had been taken into account. See “Forward-looking Statements.” Market data and statistics are inherently
predictive and subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are
based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers
and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the
relevant market. Additionally, industry publications and reports from management consultants generally state
that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the
accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not
assume liability for such information. We cannot therefore assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such
information as we have not independently verified such information.

**TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

The Group (as defined herein) owns or has rights to certain trademarks, trade names or service marks that it
uses in connection with the operation of its business. The Group asserts, to the fullest extent under applicable
law, its rights to its trademarks, trade names and service marks. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of
any other company appearing in this offering memorandum belongs to its holder.

Solely for convenience, the trademarks, trade names and copyrights referred to in this offering
memorandum are listed without the TM, [®] and [©] symbols.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**The Issuer**

The Issuer was incorporated on February 19, 2021 to facilitate the Transactions. As of the date of this
offering memorandum, the Issuer has no material assets or liabilities, does not have any revenue-generating
activities of its own and has not engaged in activities other than those related to its incorporation and in
preparation of the Transactions. As a result, no historical financial information of the Issuer is included in this
offering memorandum, except for certain limited as adjusted financial data presented to reflect certain effects of
the Transactions.

**Historical Financial Information**

**_Acquisition Perimeter_**

Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG’s, Birkenstock Immobilien GmbH & Co. KG’s, Birkenstock Cosmetics
GmbH & Co. KG’s and their respective subsidiaries’ (the “BIRKENSTOCK Group”) business activities
comprise (i) producing (a) sandals and closed shoes for daily use, free time activities and professional use,
(b) shoe components as well as orthopedic inlays, (c) products for orthopedic specialist stores, (d) other products
for foot health (Fußgesundheit) and (e) legwear, accessories, sleeping systems and natural cosmetics
(collectively, the “Products”) and (ii) sales of such Products to retailers and end-consumers (the “Target
Business”). The Issuer is directly acquiring the Target Business, by way of the acquisition of shares and certain
assets of the BIRKENSTOCK Group, through its subsidiary, Lux SPV, which has acquired German Newco, a
shell company formed by the Sellers’ advisors for purposes of the Acquisition, from the Sellers’ advisors.
German Newco will, directly or indirectly, acquire (i) the following direct subsidiaries of Birkenstock GmbH &
Co. KG: Birkenstock digital GmbH, Birkenstock Productions Rheinland Pfalz-GmbH, Birkenstock Productions
Hessen GmbH, Birkenstock Productions Sachsen GmbH, Birkenstock Components GmbH, Birkenstock
International MEA/India GmbH, Birkenstock International GmbH, Birkenstock Cosmetics Verwaltungs GmbH,
Birkenstock Global Product GmbH, Birkenstock Global Sales Verwaltungs GmbH, as well as (ii) Birkenstock
Global Sales GmbH & Co. KG, Birkenstock USA GP LLC, Birkenstock USA LP, Birkenstock Immobilien
GmbH & Co. KG, Birkenstock Immobilien Verwaltungs GmbH and Birkenstock Cosmetics GmbH & Co. KG,
which directly or indirectly own the other Birkenstock Transferred Entities (the “Acquisition Perimeter”). See
“Summary—The Transactions.”

Substantially all of the BIRKENSTOCK Group’s operations and assets, other than the shares in Birkenstock
GmbH & Co KG (the assets of which are being contributed to the Purchasers), Alpro GmbH, Alpro Management
Inc. (USA) (inactive), Alpro ProFashion LP (inactive), Birkenstock Americas GmbH (the assets of which are
being contributed to the Purchasers), Birkenstock Sales GmbH (the assets of which are being contributed to the
Purchasers), Birki Inc. (inactive), Birki LP (inactive), Lservice Management Inc. (inactive), L+L Logic Logistics
LP (inactive), Birkenstock Orthopädie GmbH (inactive), Birkenstock Real Estate GmbH, Footwear Distribution
Spain S.L. (inactive), Footwear Beteiligungs GmbH (inactive), COM GmbH (inactive), Commercial Object
Management GmbH & Co. KG (inactive) and certain domain names that the BIRKENSTOCK Group does not
use in connection with its primary business and certain trademarks for which we will enter into licensing
arrangements (collectively the “Excluded Business”), are included in the Acquisition Perimeter. Accordingly, the
financial and operating results and business operations of the Acquisition Perimeter and the BIRKENSTOCK
Group are substantially the same. Therefore, all of the historical financial information presented in this offering
memorandum is the consolidated financial information of Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG. Accordingly, unless
otherwise stated, all references to the “BIRKENSTOCK Group” in respect of the historical financial information
in this offering memorandum are to Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as
described herein. Following the Transactions, we will consolidate our financial results at a different entity. See
“—Comparability of the Financial Statements” below.

**_Financial Statements_**

This offering memorandum includes our historical consolidated financial statements listed below (the “Financial
Statements”):

   - the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG as of and for
the three months ended December 31, 2020, including comparative information for the three months
ended December 31, 2019 (the “Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”),
prepared in accordance with German GAAP;

xvi


-----

   - the English-language translation of the original German-language audited consolidated financial
statements of Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG as of and for the financial year ended September 30, 2020,
prepared in accordance with German GAAP, and the related notes thereto, including comparative
information for the fiscal year ended 2019 (the “2020 Audited Financial Statements”); and

   - the English-language translation of the original German-language audited consolidated financial
statements of Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG as of and for the financial year ended September 30, 2019,
prepared in accordance with German GAAP, and the related notes thereto, including comparative
information for the fiscal year ended 2018 (the “2019 Audited Financial Statements” and together with
the 2020 Audited Financial Statements, the “Audited Financial Statements”).

The Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance
with German GAAP. The Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with German GAAP
and audited by BDO AG Wirtschaftspru¨fungsgesellschaft (“BDO”), independent auditors, who issued an
independent auditor’s report thereon.

Any reference to Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG’s “FY” in this offering memorandum means the financial
year ended on September 30 of such year.

The label “unaudited” is used in this offering memorandum to indicate financial information that (i) has not
been taken, but derived from the Audited Financial Statements, (ii) has been taken or derived from the Unaudited
Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, (iii) has been taken or derived from the Company’s
accounting records or (iv) has been taken or derived from Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG’s internal management
reporting systems. For example, certain financial information split by product, sales channel and regional hub are
based on management accounts and are not subject to audit or review by our independent auditors. Our revenues
split by product, sales channel and regional hub differ from our audited revenues as they exclude revenues not
related to the sale of products, such as revenues from real estate rentals and sales from materials overstock, which
are presented in a separate line item labelled “Other.” Such financial information should be read in conjunction
with our Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations.”_

**_Comparability of the Financial Statements_**

Following the merger of the limited partnership shares in Footwear Distribution GmbH & Co. KG into, and
the acquisition of shares in Footwear Beteiligungs GmbH by, Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG (the “Birkenstock
USA Reorganization”), we consolidated the balance sheets of the Birkenstock USA entities that had formerly
been consolidated into the balance sheet of Footwear Distribution GmbH & Co. KG into our balance sheet as of
September 30, 2017 and the income statements of Birkenstock USA entities were consolidated into our income
statement for the first time in FY 2018. We present certain information for FY 2017 on a pro forma basis to
reflect the effects of the Birkenstock USA Reorganization. Such pro forma adjustments are based on
management information and have not been subject to any audit or review. Any financial information presented
in this offering memorandum for any period prior to FY 2018 is presented for illustrative purposes only and
investors should not place any undue reliance on such information.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations limits the comparability of our results for FY
2020 and the three months ended December 31, 2020 with the relevant corresponding periods in 2019, and may
impact comparability with future periods. See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—The
_COVID-19 Pandemic” and “Summary—Recent Developments—COVID-19 Update.”_

In addition, none of the financial information in this offering memorandum has been adjusted to reflect the
impact of any changes to the consolidated income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows that
might occur as a result of the Acquisition. We will account for the Acquisition in accordance with German
GAAP. See “Summary of Certain Differences Between German GAAP Compared to IFRS—Business
_Combinations.” Only certain limited pro forma financial data of the Issuer is presented to give effect pro forma to_
the Transactions, including the Offering. See “—Pro Forma Financial Information” below and “Capitalization.”
In the future, we will report our consolidated financial condition and results of operations at the level of another
entity in the holding structure. Due to these and other potential adjustments, future financial statements for the
Group could be materially different and may not be comparable to our Financial Statements included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Impact of the_
_Transactions” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The value of goodwill, brand names or other_

_intangible assets reported in our financial statements may need to be partially or fully impaired as a result of_
_revaluations.”_

**_Basis of Preparation_**

Our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum have been prepared in
accordance with German GAAP, which differs in certain significant respects from International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). For a discussion of significant differences between German GAAP and IFRS, see
“Summary of Certain Differences Between German GAAP Compared to IFRS.” In the future, we may prepare our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS and such change will be permitted under the
Indenture. See “Description of the Notes.”

**Financial Information Presented for the Twelve Months ended December 31, 2020**

The summary unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020
set forth in this offering memorandum was derived by adding Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG’s consolidated
financial information for FY 2020 to its consolidated financial information for the three months ended
December 31, 2020 and subtracting its consolidated financial information for the three months ended
December 31, 2019. The summary unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020 has not been audited or reviewed and is not required by, or presented in accordance with,
German GAAP and or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only. This information is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for such period or
any future period or any financial position at any past or future date. See also “—Non-GAAP Financial
_Measures.”_

**Pro Forma Financial Information**

This offering memorandum also includes certain unaudited pro forma financial information of the Issuer as
of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, including pro forma net senior secured indebtedness, pro
forma net indebtedness and pro forma interest expense, which has been prepared to give effect to the
Transactions as if they had occurred (i) on December 31, 2020, for the purposes of calculating pro forma net
senior secured indebtedness and as adjusted net indebtedness and (ii) on January 1, 2020, for the purposes of
calculating pro forma interest expense. The pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2020 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what the
Issuer’s indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2020
or January 1, 2020, respectively, nor does it purport to project the Issuer’s indebtedness or interest expense at any
future date. The pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 has
not been prepared in accordance with German GAAP, IFRS, the requirements of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any other generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the
assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020 have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted
auditing standards. See also “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by German
GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face
of the Financial Statements or footnotes thereto. The primary non-GAAP financial measures used in this offering
memorandum include Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow,
Adjusted Operating Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, EBIT, EBIT margin, EBITDA, maintenance capital
expenditures, expansion capital expenditures, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, Adjusted Free Cash
Flow Before Interest and Taxes, Operating Net Working Capital, Trade Working Capital and other figures (the
“Non-GAAP Measures”). Each of the EBITDA-based and net income-based measures presented in this offering
memorandum is defined and calculated differently from the definition of “Consolidated Net Income” and
“Consolidated EBITDA” presented in the Indenture.

Our primary Non-GAAP Measures are as follows:

   - “Adjusted EBIT” is defined as EBIT as adjusted for business scope adjustments, production shutdown
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, other COVID-19 impacts, foreign exchange rate impacts and other
adjustments, in each case, as further described in “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Data”;

xviii


-----

   - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBIT before amortization of intangible assets and
depreciation of tangible assets;

   - “Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues;

   - “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” is defined as Adjusted Operating Cash Flow less maintenance capital
expenditure;

   - “Adjusted Free Cash Flow Before Interest and Taxes” is defined as Adjusted Free Cash Flow less
expansion capital expenditures;

   - “Adjusted Operating Cash Flow” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less the change in Operating Net
Working Capital from the prior period;

   - “Cash Conversion” is defined as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA;

   - “EBIT” is defined as group net income for the period before tax on income, interest and similar
expenses and other interest and similar income;

   - “EBIT margin” is defined as EBIT divided by revenues;

   - “EBITDA” is defined as EBIT before amortization of intangible assets and depreciation on tangible
assets;

   - “expansion capital expenditures” is defined as prepayments of intangible assets and additions to assets
under construction;

   - “maintenance capital expenditures” is defined as additions to land and building, machinery and
technical equipment, factory and office equipment, as well as concessions, patents, licenses or similar
rights;

   - “Operating Net Working Capital” is defined as Trade Working Capital less other working capital
(defined as other assets plus prepaid expenses less other provisions and other liabilities);

   - “Trade Working Capital” is defined as inventories plus trade receivables less trade payables; and

   - revenues split by product, sales channel and regional hub.

These Non-GAAP Measures are presented in this offering memorandum because they are measures our
management used to assess operating performance, because we believe that they and similar measures are widely
used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure, and
because we believe they present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the
distorting effect of certain non-recurring items.

Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under German
GAAP, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternatives
to performance measures derived in accordance with German GAAP, IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles. Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of
other companies and have limitations as analytical tools. They should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under German GAAP. Some of the limitations of
Non-GAAP Measures are that:

   - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual
commitments;

   - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

   - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

   - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated
income statement;

   - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations;

   - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced
in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

xix


-----

   - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do,
limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be
available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the
Financial Statements and using these Non-GAAP Measures only to supplement evaluation of our performance.

**_Key Performance Indicators_**

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this offering
memorandum are derived from management estimates and are not part of our financial statements or our
accounting records. Our use or computation of these measures may not be comparable to the use or computation
of similarly titled measures by other companies. Any or all of these measures should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute measure of performance under German GAAP, IFRS or other generally accepted
accounting principles.

Our primary key performance indicators are defined as follows:

   - “Implied average selling price” is defined as total amount of revenues (excluding revenues not related
to the sale of products, such as revenues from real estate rentals and sales from materials overstock)
divided by the number of units sold during such period;

   - “Days inventory outstanding” or “DIO” is defined as average inventory divided by revenues and
multiplied by the number of days;

   - “Number of units sold” is defined as all products sold during a period, including pairs of footwear and
other products; and

   - “Material Unit Cost” is defined as the cost of materials divided by the number of units sold during such
period.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in million
or thousand and percentage terms, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the
data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. In
addition, as a result of such rounding, the totals of certain financial information presented in tabular form may
differ from the information that would have appeared in such totals using the unrounded financial information.
Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using
the numerical data in the Financial Statements contained in this offering memorandum, as applicable, and not
using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

In respect of financial data set forth in the main body of this offering memorandum, a dash (“—”) signifies
that the relevant figure is not available, while a zero (“0”) or nil signifies that the relevant figure is available but
has been rounded to zero. By contrast, no such differentiation has been made in respect of the financial data set
forth in the financial information section of this offering memorandum beginning on page F-1. In the financial
information section, zero (“0”) is used to signify both unavailable figures and figures which are either exactly
zero or have been rounded to zero.

**Overview**

We are an iconic brand globally renowned for crafting high quality, durable footwear that enriches the
health and wellbeing of our customers’ lives. With a proud heritage that dates back to our founding in 1774 in
Langen-Bernheim, Germany, BIRKENSTOCK has evolved into one of the foremost footwear brands in the
world, selling approximately 23 million units in nearly 100 countries worldwide and generating €753.8 million of
revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of €213.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.

We are best known as the inventors of the contoured footbed which, rooted in orthopedic theory, encourages
proper foot wellbeing, reduces pressure points, and re-emphasizes natural walking. Today, we use this legendary
footbed across all our footwear styles, several of which have developed significant global recognition and
acclaim of their own. While we have a deep and diversified assortment comprised of hundreds of styles, our five
“core classics”—the Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the Madrid and the Boston—generated nearly 75% of our
annual revenues for FY 2020 and continue to enjoy significant global consumer demand today. In fact, the
BIRKENSTOCK Arizona was the number one searched shoe in the world in Q2 2020, while our shearling-lined
Boston clogs ranked as the number two most-searched women’s shoe in Q4 2020, according to public industry
sources.

We believe that how things are made matters as much as the product itself; we make our products with deep
respect for German and European standards for ethical, social, and environmental responsibility. To that end, we
maintain strict controls over our entire supply chain—from carefully selecting high quality, sustainable materials
from our largely European supply base to hand-finishing our products in our five owned manufacturing facilities
across Germany—and a relentless focus on creating well-made, functional, and durable products. As a
consequence of our focus on quality craftsmanship, we proudly employ 3,137 skilled laborers across Germany
and represent the largest employer in the German footwear industry.

Our unwavering commitment to creating functional products with integrity throughout our nearly 250-year
history has enabled us to build an unparalleled brand reputation. Today, the BIRKENSTOCK brand has become
synonymous with the highest standards of quality, durability, and craftsmanship, enabling us to engender
best-in-class levels of consumer loyalty and trust. As one of the original inclusive brands, we are proud of the
fact that our brand and products are worn and loved by consumers around the world, regardless of age, gender,
income, and race.

The breadth of our brand and the loyalty of our global fan base have enabled us to operate from the peculiar
but privileged position where demand for our products has historically exceeded supply. This dynamic has
allowed us to create scarcity in the market and control our brand while simultaneously driving highly predictable
and consistent growth—even through the COVID-19 pandemic—as demonstrated by the compound annual
growth rate of our revenues of approximately 10% from FY 2017 (giving effect to the Birkenstock USA
Reorganization) to FY 2020. This growth has been broad-based across most channels and geographies—though
we have seen meaningful recent acceleration in our owned direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels, which have
rapidly expanded from approximately 18% of revenues in FY 2018 to approximately 32% of revenues in the
twelve months ended December 31, 2020. We believe that DTC channels—in particular, our owned e-commerce
channel—will continue to generate an increasing portion of our revenues and profits going forward.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Timeless and iconic brand rooted in 250 years of orthopedic tradition_**

We are built on nearly 250 years of orthopedic tradition. BIRKENSTOCK was created in 1774 when
cobbler Johann Adam Birkenstock was registered as “vassal and shoemaker” in the church archives in the small
Hessian village of Langen-Bergheim, Germany.

In the late 1800s, Johann’s great-great-grandson, master cobbler Konrad Birkenstock, invented the Fußbett
(“footbed”) a sole that supported the contours of the foot and promoted the wearer’s orthopedic well-being . The
footbed, which was adapted specifically for the growing factory manufactured footwear market, included
contoured arch supports made from a baked mixture of cork and latex to produce a light, resilient material
capable of supporting the body’s weight. At a time when other foot supports were made of flat, unyielding metal,
the footbed was revolutionary. In 1915, Konrad’s son, Carl Birkenstock, joined the family business. Father and
son became renowned orthopedic authorities, publishing numerous books and articles and traveling extensively
throughout Europe conducting seminars and trainings on orthopedic theory.

In 1964, Carl’s son, Karl Birkenstock, took his grandfather’s footbed one step further by adding a sole and a
leather strap that ran across the wearer’s toes. And thus, the first modern BIRKENSTOCK sandal, the Madrid,
was born. Originally launched as a fitness shoe, the design offered a multitude of ergonomic benefits to its
wearers—including to activate the grip reflex of the toes as one walks, exercising one’s foot and leg muscles.
The Madrid became an instant classic.

-----

Over the subsequent decades, we have gone on to launch hundreds of new styles and silhouettes, but all
have had one thing in common: the footbed. Konrad’s footbed and, perhaps more importantly, his revolutionary
foresight in creating products that enhance one’s whole health and wellbeing, remain the foundation of the
BIRKENSTOCK brand. Our origins and traditions still guide everything we do—from the way we select our
materials to the way we craft our products.

We believe our approach to holistic health and wellbeing has global appeal. As one of the original inclusive
brands, BIRKENSTOCK products are worn by people all over the world, regardless of age, income, race, or
gender. Our most popular products are unisex in nature and we offer products across the pricing spectrum,
ranging from €40 for our EVA products up to €400 for products from our premium 1774 collection. Most of our
core classics sell in the €75-100 range, which we believe to be a democratic and achievable price point for much
of the general population. The below chart illustrates the appeal of our brand to a broad array of customers in
Germany and the United States.

Our longstanding commitment to creating products of the highest quality has enabled us to establish a
pristine brand reputation that has resulted in a highly engaged and loyal fan base. For many of these consumers,
BIRKENSTOCK is more than just a brand, it is a way of life. In a third-party survey, approximately 69% of
surveyed customers indicated they own more than one pair of BIRKENSTOCKs and approximately 90% of
recent surveyed BIRKENSTOCK purchasers indicated a desire to repurchase our products. We are proud of our
high retention rates as our customers’ desire to repurchase is the ultimate testament to their satisfaction with our
products. The below chart illustrates the number of BIRKENSTOCK products purchased by individual
BIRKENSTOCK customers in Germany and the United States.

As time has enabled us to cement our reputation for producing high quality products, so too has it enabled
us to become a dominate player in the sandal category. The distinctive and instantly recognizable aesthetic of our
products—which we believe to be the perfect blend of function and design—have enabled us to create categories
of our own, a phenomenon that has created enormous competitive advantages for our brand. To illustrate,
approximately 51% of BIRKENSTOCK purchasers who participated in a third-party survey over the last two
years did not consider purchasing any other brand. That is to say, for over half of such BIRKENSTOCK
purchasers, we do not compete against any other brand.

_Converse, Ugg and Timberland._

Our unique and ownable aesthetic have also resulted in significant unsolicited attention from various wellknown brands seeking to create collaborations. For us, it is important that collaborations not only align with our
brand values but also push the brand forward through infusing new creative ideas. Thus, we work selectively
with brands—many with creative directors who are Birkenstock fans themselves—that we believe will craft
original products that enhance the standing of our brand. Through our 1774 line, we have conceived of and
launched multiple collaborations with labels as diverse as Stüssy, Rick Owens, and Valentino. These
collaborations, profitable in and of themselves, also serve as differentiated marketing vehicles, enabling us to
create a “halo” around BIRKENSTOCK, and to amplify our brand reach to new consumers in a cost-effective
manner. We believe our distinctive and successful use of collaborations, along with organic, unpaid support from
celebrities, have generated significant earned media.

**_Favored by societal megatrends towards casual styles, wellness, and sustainability_**

While “health and wellness” has been gaining traction with consumers over recent years, this way of
thinking has been in our brand’s DNA for centuries. Our products—specifically, our footbed—are rooted in the
orthopedic theory pioneered by Konrad Birkenstock and designed to improve foot health and restore a natural
gait.

The increased prioritization of health and wellness by the modern consumer has had dramatic and longlasting impacts on lifestyle and consumption patterns. Within the broader soft goods category in which we
operate, this has resulted, for example, in an increasing desire for comfort and function over “fashion”. These
preferences have fundamentally changed the way consumers dress today, not just at the gym or in their home but
at the workplace as well. Between 2014 and 2018, the proportion of businesses with casual dress codes increased
from approximately 30% to approximately 50% prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 according to public industry
sources. We believe the shift towards more casual styles will only further accelerate as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and the further blurring of “in-home” and “out-of-home” dress. As a brand that has prioritized health
and wellbeing for centuries, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this ongoing shift.

Similarly, the modern consumer is increasingly prioritizing sustainability and becoming more aware of and
focused on the ESG profiles of the brands they purchase. Approximately 70% of consumers believe that
sustainability is extremely or very important when purchasing fashion, according to public industry sources. In
addition, approximately 65% of consumers state that they intend to buy more high-quality items that last longer
according to McKinsey’s Report: Consumer Sentiment on Sustainability in Fashion. For us, sustainability is not a
matter of retrofitting our brand or labelling ourselves as “green” just to fit a consumer trend but is instead a
genuine way of thinking that has been deeply embedded in our ethos and way of doing business for decades. As a
result, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this ongoing emerging societal focus given the
longstanding importance of both using sustainable materials as well as ethical production to the brand.


5


-----

We utilize sustainable raw materials—most notably, cork, a naturally lightweight, breathable, and insulating
material—in the production of our shoes. Cork is a highly versatile natural material that can be harvested
multiple times without harming the tree. We source 100% of our cork—specifically, the waste byproduct of cork
used to manufacture high-quality wine stoppers—from small, family-held farms in Portugal. We then bake a
mixture of this cork with latex—in one of our two owned footbed production sites—to form our legendary
footbeds.

Our vertically integrated supply chain represents a key source of competitive advantage and enables us to
uphold high standards of ethical production. As with our cork, most of our raw materials are sourced from across
Europe in accordance with our established Code of Conduct that lays out the strict ethical and social standards
for our business. We include this Code of Conduct in all our supplier contracts to ensure that our suppliers
consistently abide by these high standards. Furthermore, we produce nearly all our products in Germany through
our five owned manufacturing facilities. See “Business—Supply Chain—Production.” By fully controlling the
production process, we know where and how our products are made, enabling us to maintain a clean and ethical
supply chain.

**_Core product icons drive consistent and recurring growth supported by complementary diversification into_**
**_adjacent footwear sub-categories_**

While we have a large product assortment comprised of hundreds of styles, our five core product families—
the Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the Madrid and the Boston—still represent the vast majority of our revenue,
contributing nearly 75% of our revenues in FY 2020. Apart from the Mayari, all these product franchises have
been on the market for decades, providing us with a highly predictable and consistent sales base. At the same
time, we have consistently demonstrated the ability to drive growth within a product family through color and
material innovation, enabling us to expand and introduce newness into our assortment with minimal risk. Growth
in our Arizona franchise, for instance, has been driven by both the core leather styles as well as through textile
innovation (e.g., recent launch of shearling and EVA franchises, and the use of other seasonal materials and
prints). As a result, revenues from sales of the Arizona silhouette have grown at a compounded annual growth
rate of 23% between FY 2016 and FY 2020.

In recent years, we have specifically focused on growing our closed-toe shoe assortment, which represented
approximately 4% of our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. We believe our strategic
focus on the closed-toe segment—which houses significant growth potential given higher average selling prices
and broader applicability across different seasons and usage occasions—is now bearing fruit. For example,
revenues from the Boston, a clog originally introduced in 1978, have grown at a compounded annual growth rate
of 13% between FY 2016 and FY 2020, as we expanded the style count and more prominently showcased the
Boston in our e-commerce and retail channels.

We also continue to invest in the orthopedic heritage of our brand, including recently forming a
biomechanics team focused on driving new technical innovations. In particular, we see significant runway in
functionally driven footwear categories such as the adventure / outdoor, orthopedic and professional segments.
We believe that innovations in these sub-vertical markets will enable the BIRKENSTOCK brand to reach new
customers and broaden its usage occasions, all while delivering on our legacy of quality, durability, and
craftsmanship.

**_Profitable growth through evolution to owned distribution channels_**

Much of our recent growth may be attributable to our deliberate strategy of increasing DTC penetration,
which enables us to purposefully and consistently express our brand identity while engaging directly with our
global fan base. Our direct-to-consumer channels (comprised of our owned e-commerce and retail channels)
represented approximately 18% of our revenues in FY 2018 and have grown to approximately 32% in the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020.

The DTC acceleration has been driven primarily by our owned e-commerce channel, which has grown at a
47% compounded annual growth rate between FY 2018 and FY 2020 and comprised 28% of our overall group
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Since 2016, we have invested a significant amount in
our online platform in order to drive this channel shift and by the end of 2020 we had launched
BIRKENSTOCK.com in 24 markets. Our e-commerce channel enables us to offer the broadest assortment as


6


-----

well as a direct channel for communication with our consumers. E-commerce also has the added financial benefit
of driving strong profit margins and enhancing the overall profitability of our overall business.

At approximately 4% of overall group revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our retail
channel represents a small, but complementary, segment of our DTC business. Most of our 52 retail locations are
in Germany, given our brand history, where we operate a network of 35 locations as of November 2020. We have
more recently embarked on a strategy of opening flagship retail locations, such as Soho and Brooklyn in New
York City, Venice Beach in California and Soho in London. While retail represents an important channel where
consumers engage physically with our brand and products, we remain extremely disciplined with our approach to
managing our footprint and highly selective with respect to profitability and expected paybacks. Going forward,
we may consider strategic additions to our retail footprint in brand appropriate locations, such as in the United
States, where we only have three locations.

Finally, our wholesale channel, which represented 68.2% of our overall group revenues for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020, enables us to broaden our distribution network and reach. Wholesale, which
spans our direct business with retail partners and our relationships with distribution partners in certain markets,
plays an important role in providing physical distribution and increasing our brand awareness globally. For our
wholesale partners, we represent an important, “must carry” brand within the footwear category given the
strength of our brand name and the customers that we attract. As a result, we generate significantly more demand
from existing and prospective new wholesale customers than we can supply, putting us in an enviable position
where we can create scarcity in the market and control our brand image. This dynamic has also enabled us to
focus on deepening our relationships with best-in-class retailers who strengthen our brand image and who extend
our reach to new and attractive customer demographics.

The antecedent for our ability to drive DTC growth in a market is the conversion of that market from a
distribution-led model to a company owned-and-operated model. Historically, the BIRKENSTOCK Group has
operated primarily as a manufacturer and supplier of high-quality footwear, relying primarily on third-party
distributors to market, sell, and expand the reach of the brand into new territories. However, today, as a result of
our strategy to increase ownership of our distribution channels, our wholesale business is comprised of a
combination of direct wholesale customers as well as legacy third-party distributors. Beginning with the
distribution takeover of the U.S. market in 2007 and legal reorganization in 2009, and accelerating after the
appointment of the first co-CEOs from outside the Birkenstock family in 2012 and our Managing Director of the
Americas in the following year, we have focused on further vertically integrating these functions into our
corporate organization to enable us greater control over the brand and distribution. Our distribution takeovers
have been critical to our success, enabling us to build brand equity while driving accelerated sales and
profitability growth. For example, in the U.S., we have grown revenues from approximately $42 million in FY
2012 to $349 million in FY 2020. Taking over direct distribution in the U.S. has allowed us to invest in
relationships only with wholesalers that are aligned with and act as custodians of our brand while also enabling
us to launch our e-commerce site in 2016 and open flagship retail stores in Soho and Brooklyn in, New York City
and Venice Beach in, California.

**_Passionate, experienced, and proven management team delivering strong financial performance supported by_**
**_a committed Sponsor_**

We benefit from the industry expertise and know-how of our passionate, experienced, and proven senior
management team, which has an average of more than 15 years of industry experience. In 2012, for the first time
in our history, we put executive leadership in place from outside the Birkenstock family. This was a pivot point
for the business, turning BIRKENSTOCK from a family-run organization to a powerful, global business that has
now experienced double digit growth for the last four years and has significantly increased profitability. Our
management team is currently led by Oliver Reichert, our Chief Executive Officer; Philipp Türoff, our Chief
Financial Officer; Markus Baum, our Chief Product Officer; Klaus Bauman, our Chief Sales Officer; and David
Kahan, our Managing Director of Americas.

Our management team has been instrumental in delivering our growth and strong financial performance. We
have experienced consistent and strong revenue growth during this period, demonstrating resilient growth even
during the period impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our revenues have grown at a compound annual growth
rate of approximately 10% from €648 million for FY 2018 to €754 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020. Our growth reflects our increasing brand reputation and customer demand globally that has


7


-----

been increasingly converted into revenue through our owned channels (i.e., owned retail stores and owned online
channels). We have also experienced consistent improvement in our profitability, demonstrated by the increase in
Adjusted EBITDA from €177.4 million for FY 2018 to €211.3 million for FY 2020, growing at a compound
annual growth rate of approximately 9%. Our Adjusted Free Cash Flow increased from approximately
€131 million in FY 2018 to approximately €239 million in FY 2020. Our stable Adjusted EBITDA margins of at
least 25% from FY 2018 to the twelve months ended December 30, 2020 and our strong cash conversion reflects
our brand strength and a diversified, vertically integrated business model with continued runway as distribution
shifts further into our owned channels.

We also benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge, and experience of our new
Sponsor. L Catterton is one of the largest and most experienced consumer-focused private equity groups in the
world, with approximately $26 billion of equity capital under management and over 30 years of experience
building iconic and enduring consumer brands. L Catterton was established in 2016 through a partnership among
Catterton, LVMH and Groupe Arnault, and today the three firms actively collaborate in areas such as consumer
insights, brand strategies, supply chain / distribution to leverage shared experiences and knowhow across the
portfolio.

**Our Strategies**

We and our Sponsor have developed the following strategies, which reflect a continuation of the journey
that we have been on over the last decade.

**_Building consumer awareness and familiarity globally_**

Our longstanding commitment to creating products of the highest quality has enabled us to establish our
global, leading brand reputation. The BIRKENSTOCK brand has become synonymous with timeless, durable,
and functional footwear with sustainability and health & wellbeing at its core. Without question, our brand is our
greatest asset and has been key to our long-term sales growth and profitability margins.

As a result of our longstanding focus on creating sustainable, “better for you” products, we believe we are
well-positioned to benefit from several of long-term secular shifts in consumer preferences, including the
increasing focus on ESG and prioritization of health and wellness. The strong and longstanding alignment of our
values with these changes in consumer purchase criteria will continue to drive outsized growth for our brand, as
more consumers discover our products and learn about our brand ethos.

To reach even more new consumers and grow our global fan base, we will continue to launch high-profile
collaborations with a diverse range of brands and creators across different industries and geographies. In the past,
these collaborations have not only been profitable, but have also enabled us to increase our brand reach to new
customers, including those in new demographics and geographies. While we have a robust pipeline of exciting
collaborations, we remain highly selective, frequently turning down partnerships that we do not believe enhance
the standing of our brand.

We have also identified several opportunities to build awareness in specific demographics. For example,
while our presence is still nascent in Asia, we believe there is potential for significant growth based on a
comparison to the success of some of our peers in the region who are relatively new market entrants. Finally, we
are also expanding our range of kids and professional footwear, all of which we expect to drive accelerated
growth in our business in coming years.

**_Accelerating the direct-to-consumer shift to continue to build brand equity and enhance margins_**

Our deliberate strategy of increasing DTC penetration—which is most evolved in the United States given
our early distribution takeover of that market—enables us to express our brand identity purposefully and
consistently while directly engaging with our global fan base. Our direct-to-customer acceleration has been
driven primarily by our e-commerce channel, which has grown at a 47% compounded annual growth rate
between FY 2018 and FY 2020 to comprise 25% of our overall group revenues for FY 2020, supported by our
investments in our online platform in recent years. The increasing proportion of DTC sales has significantly
contributed to our growing profit margins and profitability.


8


-----

We intend to replicate the success of our U.S. DTC strategy across Europe and Asia, which we expect will
lay the foundation for long-term, accretive growth. Our primary avenue of DTC will be through our e-commerce
sales channel, which we have been rapidly growing through new online store openings since 2016, with the most
recent being our online store in India added in 2020. Going forward, we may consider strategic additions to our
retail footprint, and will focus on building profitable stores with short payback periods, focusing on a small
footprint, with flexible leases in brand appropriate locations, such as in the United States, where we only have
three locations.

Our ability to accelerate global DTC growth goes hand-in-hand with our ability to directly control
distribution across the various markets in which we operate. As such, we plan to continue with our longstanding
strategy to gradually takeover distribution in key markets to support our direct-to-consumer growth strategy and
to increase control over our brand. While we have already taken over distribution in several of our critical
markets, we still have distribution agreements with third-parties in place for several markets in Europe and Asia.
Over the coming years, when it is strategically beneficial, we will look to convert certain of those distributor
markets to company owned-and-operated, which will drive long-term accretive growth.

**_Diversifying product assortment and usage occasions_**

Our five core iconic product families—the Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the Madrid and the Boston—
have, apart from the Mayari, been on the market for decades and provide us with a highly predictable and
consistent sales base. In recent years, we have successfully driven growth within these iconic product franchises
through the introduction of new materials and fabrications (e.g., shearling, vegan leather alternatives) and price
bands (e.g., launch of opening price point EVA line and luxury collaborations through 1774 segment). Going
forward, we will continue expanding these iconic product families through further design, construction, and
materials updates.

We plan to drive future, incremental growth primarily through diversification into closed-toe shoes, which
will enable us to serve different usage occasions for consumers, balance seasonality, and drive growth and
profitability through higher average selling prices. We believe we have made substantial progress against this
strategic effort in recent years, as demonstrated by the performance of the Boston silhouette. The Boston, a clog
originally launched in 1978 has enjoyed a compound annual growth rate of 13% between FY 2016 and FY 2020
as we expanded the style count and more prominently featured the silhouette in our stores and e-commerce site.

We have identified runway in other functionally driven footwear categories, such as the adventure / outdoor,
orthopedic, and professional segments. We are investing in the successful development of these products, and as
an example, we have recently formed a biomechanics team that is focused on driving new technical innovations,
such as non-slip treaded sole, solid steel toe cap, and oil, grease, and water-resistant materials. We believe that
innovations in these niche markets will enable the BIRKENSTOCK brand to reach new customers and broaden
its usage occasions, all while delivering on our legacy of quality, durability, and craftsmanship.

**_Investing in production and IT systems to enable the next decade of growth_**

Since we began manufacturing our first footbeds in the early twentieth century, we have always made our
own products. In fact, up until the early-2010s we operated primarily as a manufacturer and supplier of highquality footwear and largely relied on third-party distributors to sell our products. And though, over the years, we
have continued to grow and scale our brand, we remain deeply committed to our roots of German manufacturing
excellence.

Our vertically integrated supply chain represents a key source of competitive advantage and enables us to
uphold our high standards of craftsmanship and ethical production. To this day, our products are handcrafted by
the 3,137 skilled workers we employ in our owned production facilities in Germany. Over the past three years,
almost all of our expansion capital expenditures have been invested in enhancing our in-house production
capabilities to meet the demands of our growing business. For example, our in-house team of engineers have
developed proprietary, leading-edge automation technologies that we are in the process of implementing, and that
we expect will improve our manufacturing cost structure and further enhance the quality and consistency of our
products. For the avoidance of doubt, our automation technologies are not meant to reduce or replace our
manufacturing workforce; if anything, we will continue to invest in and scale our production capabilities in
Germany.


9


-----

Going forward, while our existing supply chain has the scale to support our growth plan, we have the
potential to iterate our production and planning approach to increasingly support our shift to DTC. To that end,
we plan to continue to strategically invest behind manufacturing innovations that will support a shift towards
demand-based production as well as increase capacity for longer-term growth.

Similarly, while we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on our owned DTC channels, we plan to
continue to invest in technology and systems to support owned channel growth and to optimize critical
operational processes as our supply chain grows larger and more complex. For example, near-term investments
may include CRM, forecasting and logistics management.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On February 25/26, 2021, the Purchasers, consisting of entities indirectly controlled by the Sponsor, entered
into the Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire from the Sellers the Target Business. We currently expect the
Acquisition to complete by April 30, 2021. The consummation of the Acquisition is, however, subject to the
satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including customary antitrust and regulatory approvals. Under the
terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers have agreed to take all necessary steps to obtain the
required clearances following the signing of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. If closing has not occurred by
July 31, 2021 (the “Acquisition Longstop Date”), unless the Sellers and the Purchasers have agreed in writing to
postpone the Acquisition Longstop Date, the Sale and Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The purchase price for the Acquisition and estimated repayment of the amounts outstanding under the
Existing Credit Facility is approximately €3,700 million, as adjusted for certain notified cash leakage items and
certain other adjustments required under the Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Price”). In addition to
the Purchase Price, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the German Newco will grant to the Birkenstock GmbH &
Co. KG an earn-out note in an amount of €400 million, which shall become payable if certain conditions are met.
BK LC Lux Midco S.à r.l. (“MidCo”), the direct shareholder of the Parent shall ultimately assume all obligations
to pay the amount under the earn-out note from German Newco with full discharge.

An amount of the Purchase Price of €525 million (the “Deferred Purchase Price”) will not become due and
payable as of the Acquisition Closing Date and instead will be deferred by Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG and
distributed to certain of the Sellers (i) granted as an interest-bearing instrument issued by AB-Beteiligungs
GmbH as lender to German Newco and then transferred by German Newco via the intermediate companies and
ultimately to the Parent in the amount of €275 million (the “Shareholder’s Note”) and (ii) contributed by CB
Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG (“CBB”) into Midco (the “Shareholder Rollover”) in the amount of €250 million,
in each case, pursuant to the terms agreed between the Sellers and the Purchasers under the Sale and Purchase
Agreement and subject to the entry into definitive agreements expected to be entered on the Acquisition Closing
Date.

The Sale and Purchase Agreement contains customary warranties given by the Sellers as to capacity, title
and certain business matters as well as customary interim operating covenants given by the Sellers regarding,
among other things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of the BIRKENSTOCK Group pending closing of
the Acquisition. The Sellers’ liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations.

Furthermore, subject to certain customary exceptions, the Sellers have agreed that, for two years from the
Acquisition Closing Date, neither they nor their affiliates will engage in the territory in which the Target
Business is conducted as of the Acquisition Closing Date, directly or indirectly, in the field of activities in which
the Target Business is active, or which the Target Business has specifically planned to become active in, as of the
Acquisition Closing Date. In addition, certain members of the Birkenstock family have entered into an agreement
with the Purchasers under which they undertake to comply with the non-compete obligation pursuant to the Sale
and Purchase Agreement and grant the Purchasers the right to use the name “Birkenstock,” subject to the
Acquisition Closing Date having occurred. See “Risks Related to Our Business—If the Birkenstock family were to
_start a business in competition with us and they would be entitled to use the Birkenstock name, or if our use of_
_Birkenstock as part of our company name is blocked as a consequence of challenges raised by the Birkenstock_
_family, our business may be materially adversely affected.”_

The Issuer is indirectly acquiring the Target Business through its subsidiary, Lux SPV, which has acquired
German Newco, a shell company formed by the Sellers’ advisors for purposes of the Acquisition, from the


10


-----

Sellers’ advisors. German Newco will, directly or indirectly, acquire the Birkenstock Transferred Entities. See
“Summary—The Transactions.” Substantially all of the BIRKENSTOCK Group’s operations and assets other
than the Excluded Business are included in the Acquisition Perimeter. Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the
Issuer will not have control over the board of directors of the Birkenstock Transferred Entities. Prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date, the board of directors of the Birkenstock Transferred Entities will be required to
manage the Group under its own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interests of the Group. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—The Issuer does not currently control the Birkenstock
_Transferred Entities and will not control the Birkenstock Transferred Entities until the Acquisition Closing_
_Date.”_

**_Sources and Uses for the Acquisition_**

The funding for the Acquisition, the repayment of the Existing Credit Facility and the payment of related
fees and expenses and other costs related to the Transactions consist of proceeds from the following sources:

   - (i) equity contributions from the Sponsors and other co-investors in the form of subscription to
ordinary equity shares equaling approximately €1,780 million and contributed to German Newco
through intermediate holding companies (the “Equity Contribution”) and (ii) the deferred consideration
in the form of the Shareholder’s Note and the Shareholder Rollover; and

   - (i) drawings under the Senior Term Facilities in an aggregate amount of €1,075 million (equivalent)
and (ii) the proceeds from the offering of the Notes offered hereby.

The notional sources and uses necessary to consummate the Acquisition are shown in the table below.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the actual Acquisition
Closing Date, the actual purchase price for the Acquisition, the actual amounts outstanding under the Existing
Credit Facility on the Acquisition Closing Date (including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other
prepayment premiums), any fluctuations in currency exchange rates for amounts not denominated in euro, the
amount of the Equity Contribution or other available sources of cash and differences between estimated and
actual fees and expenses. In particular, the purchase price under the Sale and Purchase Agreement is subject to
certain notified cash leakage items and certain other adjustments required under the Sale and Purchase
Agreement.

amount to prepay in full all outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility. The Purchase Price will be paid in cash at
closing, other than the Deferred Purchase Price which will be deferred pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder’s Note and the terms of
the rollover contributed by one of the Sellers to Midco. The Existing Credit Facility and any interest swaps related thereto will be
terminated effective as of the Acquisition Closing Date. See “The Transactions.”

(7) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including underwriting, financial advisory, legal, accounting,
ratings advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees (but excluding net interest expense that will accrue on proceeds of the
Notes to the extent that they are deposited into escrow).

**_Escrow Account_**

If the Issue Date is expected to occur more than three business days prior to the Acquisition Closing Date,
pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the
Offering of the Notes into the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer. To the extent the proceeds of the
Offering are deposited into the Escrow Account, the Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and
will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. See
“Summary—The Offering—Collateral.” If and to the extent the Issue Date is expected to occur within three
business days prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer shall not be required to deposit cash equal to the
gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account.

The release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly
(and in any event within three business days). See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption.” If these conditions are not satisfied on or before the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the_
occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special
mandatory redemption price for the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory
redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property_
_are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account may not have sufficient_
_funds to cover such redemption without relying on funding from the Parent.”_

In the event of a special mandatory redemption, the Parent will be required to fund the Issuer in such
aggregate amounts as are required in order to enable the Issuer to pay any funding shortfall, including Escrow
Account fees, negative interest on the Escrow Account’s balances, costs and accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such special mandatory redemption date. See
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not_
_satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account may not have sufficient funds_
_to cover such redemption without relying on funding from the Parent.”_

**Recent Developments**

**_Our Response to COVID-19_**

The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on economic activity across our markets in
2020. In response to COVID-19, we closed our production facilities in Germany in April 2020 and implemented
wage and hour reductions through “short-time work” (Kurzarbeit) programs for manufacturing and logistics
workers, pursuant to which the German government provided benefits that replaced at least 60% of employee
wages for the time that they could not work. Three of our facilities started production again in late May and early
June of 2020. Our Ürzell facilities, however, remained closed until September 2020. All of our facilities have
reopened since then and since November 2020 all productions and distribution workers have returned to regular
hours; only retail workers continue to have their hours reduced due to the new lockdowns. We also terminated
relationships with temporary employees at the end of an assignment but were unable to re-hire much of the same
talent upon re-opening. As a result, we incurred one-time training costs of €3.2 million for FY 2020 due to
temporary workers hired on reopening and we paid one-time bonuses to employees in the amount of €1.2 million
due to the additional efforts demonstrated by our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we
furloughed employees in the United States in March of 2020. All employees were provided return offers. In total,
we incurred unplanned idle costs of €16.7 million in FY 2020 (excluding idle costs assumed in budget or outside
the shutdown period) reflecting personnel expenses, depreciation and other fixed costs related to the production
facilities, and other additional costs associated with stocking raw materials in March 2020 in anticipation of
delays and supply chain disruptions. We also incurred other costs of €0.4 million primarily related to disinfecting
production sites and offices and purchasing face masks for our employees.

In FY 2020, our wholesale and retail channels were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,
including lockdown measures resulting in the temporary closures of retail stores. Sales volumes fell to
23.0 million units compared to 25.1 million units in the prior-year period. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on
cross-border trading, the operation of retail stores and our production during the two-month shutdown of our
facilities as a result of the pandemic, our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for FY 2020 increased by 1.2% and
15%, respectively, compared to FY 2019. This increase was due to higher average sales prices achieved through
increased e-commerce sales due to the expansion of our e-commerce channel in the Americas and Europe, our
revenues from e-commerce sales growing by approximately 80% as compared to FY 2019. We expect the shift


13


-----

from sales in our wholesale channel to sales in our e-commerce channel to continue during 2021. The growth was
further driven by increased sales in the fourth quarter of FY 2020 from orders in wholesale and the re-opening of
retail stores in some markets. We have seen continued momentum in our high-average selling price, high-margin
online channel, and a rapid rebound in our wholesale channel, where demand for over 100% of the FY 2021
wholesale budget had already been booked, showing a strong increase versus the previous year, and providing
solid earnings visibility for the remainder of FY 2021. However, due to charges resulting from the temporary
closure of our production facilities and retail stores, particularly in the third quarter of FY 2020, our EBIT
decreased by 10.6% to €143.3 million as compared to €160.3 million in FY 2019. Unavoidable fixed costs in
production and sales also had a negative impact on earnings. In addition, the flexibility required to respond to
workload peaks resulted in higher costs. This was offset by the positive impact of the early and comprehensive
measures introduced in connection with COVID-19 to safeguard liquidity and earnings, the German
government’s support in the form of reduced hours compensation (Kurzarbeitergeld) and other measures aimed
at reducing costs. EBIT margin fell by 2.6 percentage points to 19.6%, compared to 22.2% for the previous year.
For the three months ended December 31, 2020, our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were
€27.3 million and 21%, respectively.

Protecting the health and safety of our employees has been a key priority during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We have put in place a number of safety protocols to prevent the spread of the virus, which have helped us limit
the number of cases among our employees. We have provided employees the opportunity to work remotely when
possible, and we developed a one-page policy outlining vacation protocols with COVID-19 testing and
quarantining. We also have in place a mobile working policy which indicates that remote work may be provided
to employees who have childcare responsibilities. In addition, we have developed policies that cover common
precautions, including handwashing, sanitization of surfaces, and opening windows to increase air flow.
Employees who experience any symptoms or who have been exposed to the virus by others are instructed to
notify their manager. Masks are required for employees and visitors when entering our facilities, although
employees can remove them once at their workstation given that they maintain an adequate distance from others.
We actively track confirmed cases among our employees in a centralized database, and a root cause analysis and
contact tracing is performed in each instance. We also follow the advice from the authorities with respect to the
pandemic and invite regulators to our sites to review safety protocols. We conducted a risk assessment for the
Markersdorf and Bernstadt facilities, detailing hazards related to COVID-19 and identifying recommended risk
mitigation measures. Furthermore, all of our retail locations are adhering to requirements surrounding
sanitization, social distancing, and the use of face coverings. In addition, we have taken steps to ensure that our
Portuguese manufacturing partners are adequately protecting their employees. Since Portugal has been notably
impacted by the pandemic over the last few months, we have performed targeted audits of these suppliers to
ensure they are adhering to appropriate protocols.

Although the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon our business will depend upon the severity
and duration of the pandemic as well as actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in
response, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, our business has remained resilient
throughout the pandemic. For more information regarding the risks and associated uncertainties related to
COVID-19 and its potential effect on our business and results of operations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Business—Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be,_
_adversely affected by the current COVID-19 public health pandemic.”_

**_Recent Trading_**

Our revenues increased by approximately €17.3 million, or 6.6%, from approximately €261.3 million for the
five months ended February 29, 2020 to approximately €278.5 million for the five months ended February 28,
2021 primarily due to the continued momentum in the higher margin e-commerce sales channel. In our wholesale
channel, demand for over 100% of the FY 2021 wholesale budget had already been booked, showing a strong
increase versus the previous year, and providing solid earnings visibility for the remainder of FY 2021.

_The preliminary financial data included in this section as of and for the five months ended_
_February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2021, presented below has been prepared by, and is the sole responsibility_

**Collateral . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If the Issue Date is expected to occur more than three business days**
prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, on the Issue Date, the Notes
and the Note Guarantees thereof will be secured on a first-priority

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will, pursuant
to the Intercreditor Agreement, be secured by the Shared Collateral
on a junior-priority basis to the Senior Term Facilities and the ABL
Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The security interests may be limited by applicable law or subject to
certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability. For
more information on the security interests granted, see “Description
_of the Notes—Security,” and for more information on potential_
limitations to the security interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of_
_the Note Guarantees and Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks Related to the Notes.”_

The security interests may be released under certain circumstances. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating the Notes—There are circumstances
_other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_
_Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released_
_automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent_
_obtaining your further consent,” “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” and “Description of the_
_Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The proceeds from the Offering of the Notes, together with**
borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities, the proceeds from the
Shareholder’s Note, the Shareholder Rollover and the Equity
Contribution will be used (i) to fund the consideration payable for
the Acquisition, (ii) to repay all amounts outstanding under the
Existing Credit Facility, (iv) for cash overfunding and (v) to pay the
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See
“Use of Proceeds.”

**Additional Amounts** . . . . . . . . . . . . . Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to
the Notes or Note Guarantees will be made without withholding or
deduction for taxes unless required by law. If such withholding or
deduction is required by law in any “relevant taxing jurisdiction,” the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay the
additional amounts necessary so that the net amounts received after
the withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that would
have been received in the absence of the withholding or deduction,
subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes.”_

**Optional Redemption** . . . . . . . . . . . . All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to
, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date
plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering
memorandum. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Optional_
_Redemption.”_

At any time prior to, 2024, up to 40% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes may be redeemed with the net
proceeds of one or more specified equity offerings at a redemption
price equal to %, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”


20


-----

Prior to, 2024, up to 10% of the original principal amount of
Notes (including any additional Notes of the same series) may be
redeemed in each calendar year, commencing on the Issue Date, at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, up to the
redemption date. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Optional_
_Redemption.”_

The Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after, 2024, at
the redemption prices set forth under “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption.”_

**Optional Redemption for Tax**
**Reasons** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the event of certain developments affecting taxation that become
effective on or after the Issue Date, an Issuer may redeem the Notes
in whole but not in part, at any time, upon giving written notice, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change**
of control or upon certain asset sales, each holder of Notes may
require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes at a price
equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Change_ _of_
_Control.”_

**Escrow Proceeds; Special Mandatory**
**Redemption** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If the Issue Date is expected to occur more than three business days
prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, concurrently with the closing
of the Offering, and pending consummation of the Acquisition, the
Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into
the Escrow Account, held in the name of the Issuer. The Escrow
Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent, and pledged on a
first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of
the Notes. The release of the proceeds deposited in the Escrow
Account will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the
Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event within three
business days). Upon delivery to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent
of an officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to the release of
the proceeds from escrow are satisfied, the Escrowed Property will
be released to the Issuer and utilized as described in “Use of
_Proceeds” and “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;_
_Special Mandatory Redemption.” If the conditions to the release of_
the Escrowed Property have not been satisfied on or prior to the
business day immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date, or
upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject
to a special mandatory redemption.

The special mandatory redemption price of the Notes will be equal to
100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
such special mandatory redemption date.

In the event of a special mandatory redemption, the Parent will be
required to fund the Issuer in such aggregate amounts as are required
in order to enable the Issuer to pay any funding shortfall, including
Escrow Account fees, negative interest on the Escrow Account’s


21


-----

balances, costs and accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such special
mandatory redemption date.

In addition, the conditions applicable to the special mandatory
redemption may be waived by holders of the Notes representing a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding.

See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the_
_Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release of the_
_Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to_
_redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account may not have sufficient_
_funds to cover such redemption without relying on the Escrow Equity_
_Commitment.”_

**Certain Covenants** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture will limit, among other things, the ability of the Issuer
and the restricted subsidiaries to:

                          - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                          - create or incur certain liens;

                          - make certain restricted payments;

                          - make certain investments;

                          - impose restrictions on the ability of their subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to the Issuer;

                          - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                          - transfer, receive or sell certain assets including subsidiary stock;

                          - consolidate or merge with other entities; and

                          - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes.

Each of the covenants in the Indenture is subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants.”_

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as we
achieve investment grade ratings. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Termination of Covenants on Achievement of_
_Investment Grade Status.”_

**U.S. Federal Income Tax**
**Considerations** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of
an investment in the Notes, see “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.” You should consult your_
own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other
tax consequences of an investment in the Notes.

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof have not been registered**
under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction and will not be so registered. The Notes are subject to
restrictions on transferability and resale. See “Transfer Restrictions.”
Holders of the Notes will not have the benefit of any exchange or
registration rights.

**Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. You should**
consider carefully all the information in this offering memorandum
and, in particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set
forth in the “Risk Factors” section before making a decision whether
to invest in the Notes.


22

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no**
market. Although the Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised us
that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated
to do so and they may discontinue market making at any time
without notice. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that an active
trading market will develop for the Notes.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of the Notes**
on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that
the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that
such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market
pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in
financial instruments, as amended.

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be governed**
by the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt,
the application of articles 470-1 to 470-19 (inclusive) of the
Luxembourg law on commercial companies, dated 10 August 1915,
as amended, is expressly excluded.

The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by the laws of
England and Wales. Each Security Document will be governed by
applicable local laws.

**SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

_The following tables present our summary financial information and have been derived from, and should be_
_read in conjunction with, our Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with German GAAP_
_and are included elsewhere herein and the sections entitled “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,”_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Use of Proceeds”_
_and “Capitalization.”_

_The Issuer was incorporated in order to facilitate the Transactions and as of the date of this offering_
_memorandum, has no material assets or liabilities, does not have any revenue-generating activities of its own_
_and has not engaged in activities other than those related to its incorporation and in preparation of the_
_Transactions. As a result, no historical financial information of the Issuer is included in this offering_
_memorandum, except for certain limited pro forma financial data presented to reflect certain effects of the_
_Transactions. The historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is that of the_
_BIRKENSTOCK Group. Following the Transactions, we will consolidate our financial results at a different_
_entity. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”_

_We have extracted (i) the consolidated historical financial information of the BIRKENSTOCK Group as of_
_and for the financial years ended September 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020 from the Audited Consolidated Financial_
_Statements and (ii) the consolidated historical financial information of the BIRKENSTOCK Group as of and for_
_the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 from the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated_
_Financial Statements, in each case, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

_The financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 presented below was derived by_
_adding the BIRKENSTOCK Group’s consolidated financial information for FY 2020 to its consolidated financial_
_information for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and subtracting its consolidated financial_
_information for the three months ended December 31, 2019. The summary unaudited consolidated financial_
_information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 is not required by or presented in accordance with_
_German GAAP or HGB has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of_
_our results of operations or our financial condition for any full year period or at any future date. See_
_“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Financial Information Presented for the Twelve Months_
_ended December 31, 2020.”_

_We also present certain unaudited pro forma financial information of the Issuer as of and for the twelve_
_months ended December 31, 2020, including pro forma net senior secured indebtedness, as adjusted net_
_indebtedness and pro forma interest expense, which has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the Transactions_
_as if the Transactions had occurred (i) on December 31, 2020, for the purposes of calculating pro forma net_
_senior secured indebtedness and pro forma net indebtedness and (ii) on January 1, 2020, for the purposes of_
_calculating pro forma interest expense. The pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve months_
_ended December 31, 2020, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our_
_indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2020, or_
_January 1, 2020, respectively; nor does it purport to project our financial results, indebtedness or interest_
_expense at any future date. The pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve months ended_
_December 31, 2020, has not been prepared in accordance with German GAAP, IFRS or any other generally_
_accepted accounting standards or in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the_
_Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, or any other regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange_
_Commission, or any other regulator. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the_
_resulting pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, have been_
_audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards._

_We present below certain financial measures, certain performance indicators, ratios and other_
_non-financial operating measures that are not recognized by German GAAP or any other generally accepted_
_accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of the Financial Statements or_
_footnotes thereto or that may derived from management estimates and are not part of our financial statements or_
_our accounting records. Prospective investors should bear in mind that Non-GAAP Measures, certain_
_performance indicators, ratios and other non-financial operating measures that we report herein are not_
_measurements of our performance or liquidity under German GAAP, IFRS or any other generally accepted_
_accounting principles, should not be considered as substitutes to performance measures derived in accordance_

_with German GAAP, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles, may not be comparable to_
_other similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be_
_considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under German GAAP._

(1) For a definition of our Adjusted EBITDA-based metrics, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial
_Measures.” We believe that our Adjusted EBITDA-based measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and_
our ability to incur and service our indebtedness. Our Adjusted EBITDA-based measures and ratios are not measurements of our
performance or liquidity under German GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in
accordance with German GAAP, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Our Adjusted EBITDA-based measures
may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under German GAAP. Because of these
limitations, our Adjusted EBITDA-based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in
the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to service our indebtedness. You should compensate for
these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein and using these non-GAAP measures only
to supplement evaluation of our performance. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Set forth below is a reconciliation of each of EBIT, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA to group net
income for the period which we believe is their closest comparable GAAP measure.

equipment (€0.2 million in FY 2020 and €0.4 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020).

(d) Represents (i) adjustments to exclude the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses related to transactions denominated in
currencies other than the euro (primarily the U.S. dollar), and (ii) translational gains and losses on EBITDA level related to the
conversion of Birkenstock USA LP from the U.S. dollar to euro under the assumption of unchanged currencies compared to prior
year.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors in the Notes should_
_carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this offering memorandum_
_before making a decision to invest in the Notes. Any of the following risks, individually or together, could_
_adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects, and accordingly the value_
_of the Notes. This section describes the risks and uncertainties that we believe are material, but these risks and_
_uncertainties may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those of which_
_we are currently unaware or those which we currently deem immaterial, may also result in decreased sales,_
_assets and cash inflows, increased expenses, liabilities or cash outflows or other events that could result in a_
_decline in the value of the Notes, or which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_
_position, results of operations and prospects. The order in which the risks are presented does not necessarily_
_reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude of their potential impact on our business, financial_
_position, results of operations and prospects or on the trading price of the Notes._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. For_
_more information, see “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely_**
**_affected by the COVID-19 pandemic._**

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and any possible future outbreaks could have, an adverse effect
on us. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the reactions of governmental and other authorities to contain, mitigate or
combat the pandemic, have severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world, have impacted,
and are expected to continue to impact, our operations, and the nature, extent and duration of the impact of
COVID-19 or any future disease or adverse health condition is highly uncertain and beyond our control. In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of many countries have taken preventative or protective
actions, such as imposing lockdowns, curtailing travel, closure of schools, prohibitions of mass gatherings,
mandatory remote working, and in some countries, the ability to access manufacturing facilities and office
buildings. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant economic dislocation in many of the countries in
which we operate and sell our products, which has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity
and a related increase in unemployment. Were a recession to occur, we cannot predict the length of such
recession or the short- and long-term impact it may have on the global economy or our business specifically.
Resurgences or further outbreaks of COVID-19 are also likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where any
further outbreaks may occur, their duration, how far into the future we may experience outbreaks nor can we
predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent outbreaks, including the impacts of future national or
local lockdowns or other measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. As of April 2021,
COVID-19 outbreaks were significantly affecting many countries, including Germany and other countries in
which we operate, with cases rising markedly and with new, more contagious strains of the virus emerging. Any
or all such consequences may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

As a response to COVID-19, we initiated a shutdown of production at four of our production sites, Görlitz,
Strödt, Bernstadt and Steinau-Ürzell beginning in April 2020. While production resumed at three of our sites in
late May or early June of 2020, the downtime at the Steinau-Ürzell site continued until September 2020. The
production shutdown resulted in unplanned idle costs of €16.7 million (excluding idle costs assumed in budget or
outside the shutdown period). In the three months ended December 31, 2020, we significantly ramped up
production to replenish depleted inventory levels. The average cost per unit increased significantly compared to
normal levels in the period that our production sites were closed. We also incurred additional costs associated
with stocking raw materials in March 2020 in anticipation of delays and supply chain disruptions. While we
continue to monitor the situation, we do not currently envisage further disruption to our supply chain and
distribution channels, and believe our inventory levels are sufficient; however, any future mandatory shutdowns,
reductions in operations or other restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our retail stores in Europe, America and
Asia have been closed at times, resulting in a significant decrease in our revenues from our Retail channel. Due

31


-----

to local government mandated “stay-at-home” orders, on March 29, 2020, we shut our two retail locations in the
United States and laid off the retail staff. We also laid off certain corporate staff. We received short-time working
(Kurzarbeit) compensation from the German government’s employment agency (KUG) in the amount of
€6.1 million for FY 2020. Such payments are subject to a final review (Vorbehalt der Nachprüfung) of the
conditions for the payments by the Federal Labor Agency. While we believe we are in compliance with these
requirements, this payroll relief could be clawed back by the government in the event that these eligibility criteria
are not met. In addition, even though our locations in Europe were able to reopen, we have had to close again our
retail stores in certain locations as governments reintroduced lockdown measures, and we cannot predict how
long such lockdown measures will last or, if lifted, if they could be reintroduced in the future.

Many of our wholesale customers have also closed at times, with some rescheduling orders, resulting in
deferred wholesale revenues (including distributor revenue) and requiring a build-up of inventory in order to
mitigate any disruptions in our distribution channels. Despite proactive measures by us to address COVID-19 and
the significant increase in revenues from our e-commerce channels during the course of the COVID-19
pandemic, our revenues in our retail was adversely affected. In the three months ended December 31, 2020, our
retail sales declined by 26.0% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. As a
precautionary matter, we also collected deposits from certain wholesale partners for potential defaults due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, primarily related to our U.S. operations. Any further outbreaks of COVID-19 and related
measures to contain such outbreaks could impact existing orders from customers and our ability to fulfill such
orders.

Although we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our
business, including disinfecting production sites and offices, purchasing face masks for our employees, actively
tracking any confirmed cases of COVID-19 and performing root cause analysis, and inviting regulators to our
sites to review safety protocol, these measures may not fully mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
our business, or adequately protect against any outbreaks of COVID-19 at our production facilities. We have also
incurred certain costs in connection with implementing these measures and with hiring replacement workers
following the reopening of our production facilities. We have also taken steps to ensure that our manufacturing
partners in Portugal are adequately protecting employees at their production sites and have performed COVID-19
audits on certain of our logistics partners, but may still be subject to business or reputation risks if such measures
are inadequate. We cannot, however, predict the degree to, or the period over, which we will be affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic and the need to continue implementing such measures. Given evolving government
policies and the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 in several countries where we operate, and despite the
development of a vaccine, there may be further impacts on the economies or the consumer purchasing power of
the countries where we operate.

Any of the foregoing including any resulting deterioration in general economic conditions or change in
consumer behavior, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations
and prospects.

To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity or
results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk
_Factors” section. For more details on how COVID-19 has impacted, and may continue to impact, our business,_
see “Summary—Recent Developments—COVID-19.”

**_Our business is dependent on the image and reputation of the Birkenstock brand._**

Our business and financial performance is largely dependent on the image, perception and recognition of the
Birkenstock brand, which, in turn, depends on many factors such as the distinctive character and quality of our
products, product design, the image and presentation of our online and retail stores, our social media activities,
advertising, public relations and marketing, and our general corporate and market profile, which can be adversely
affected for reasons within and outside our control. For example, our products can be actively or mistakenly
presented in a specific context not related to our brand (e.g., ethically, religiously, politically); we could
experience customer dissatisfaction through our customer services in the direct to consumer or business to
business segment; we could have issues relating to not properly maintained and monitored relationships with
suppliers with respect to quality of products or conditions of the business of our suppliers; and we could receive
negative publicity, including inaccurate adverse information, from our business partners, competitors or
employees.

Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate
integrity and culture, including with regard to the sustainability of our products. Negative claims or publicity

32


-----

involving us or our products, or the production methods of any of our suppliers or the materials we source, could
seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims or publicity are accurate. In
addition, we have been increasing our online presence through our expanding e-commerce channel. Our social
media presence amplifies consumer engagement with the Birkenstock brand but comes with less control due to
consumer comments and hashtags compared to more traditional public relations and marketing methods, which
could associate the brand with content which is not aligned with our values. Social media influencers or other
endorsers of our products could engage in behavior that reflects poorly on our brand and may be attributed to us
or otherwise adversely affect us. Further, our brand reputation could be harmed if it became associated with
negative media, for example, if we or our senior executives may from time to time take positions on social issues
that may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or
retain such customers. Our brand reputation could also be harmed if we experience a cyber-attack or loss of
consumer data. Adverse publicity could undermine consumer confidence in the Birkenstock brand and reduce
long-term demand for our products, even if such publicity is unfounded.

Any failure to maintain favorable brand recognition could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See also “—Our sales and distribution channels are
_dependent on cooperation with third parties,” “—We face risks arising from any future transformation of our_
_operations through the conversion of wholesale distribution markets to owned and operated markets, as well as_
_any productivity or efficiency initiatives we undertake” and “—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may be_
_unsuccessful in preventing a member of the Birkenstock family from using their surname as a company name in_
_the future.”_

**_Our sales and distribution channels are dependent on cooperation with third parties._**

The distribution of our products is based on business-to-business wholesale sales (both online and retail)
and direct-to-consumer sales through our owned retail stores and owned e-commerce platforms. Therefore, we
rely on our ability to work together with third parties in our wholesale sales channel, including wholesale
customers and distributors, to ensure that our products are sold in environments and in a manner consistent with
our brand image. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, sales through third-party channels accounted
for 68.2% of our sales. Actions by these third-party distribution channels that vary from our policies, such as
presenting our products in a manner inconsistent with our preferred positioning or offering our products
alongside “lookalike” products, could damage our brand and reputation. If our third-party sales channels do not
maintain the standards of quality, brand positioning and exclusivity we require, or if they otherwise misuse the
Birkenstock brand, there is a risk that our reputation and the integrity of the brand may be damaged. This may in
turn lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We face risks arising from any future transformation of our operations through the conversion of wholesale_**
**_distribution markets to owned and operated markets, as well as any productivity or efficiency initiatives we_**
**_undertake._**

We continuously assess opportunities to streamline operations, achieve cost savings, and fuel long-term
profitable growth. For example, we are currently in the process of transforming our global distribution strategy,
from cooperating with distributors to operating through owned individual offices and local entities, with a view
to having further distribution control as well as driving revenue. The implementation of our transformation
strategy presents a number of significant risks, including:

   - actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service levels to customers and consumers;

   - actual or perceived disruption to suppliers, distribution networks and other important operational
relationships and the inability to resolve potential conflicts in a timely manner;

   - difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality from suppliers;

   - diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and strategic objectives;

   - disruption to our culture;

   - failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees; and

   - actual or threatened claims and law suits from current and/or former distributors.

As our agreements with distributors are long term and typically require 18-24 months’ notice prior to
termination, any changes to our distribution channels require advanced planning to implement and lead times

33


-----

may vary. Furthermore, if we experience adverse changes to our business, additional restructuring or
reorganization activities may be required in the future. Due to these and other factors, we cannot predict whether
we will fully realize the purpose and anticipated benefits or cost savings of any restructuring, productivity or
efficiency initiatives and, if we do not, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our business is influenced by economic conditions that impact consumer spending and our operations._**

Our business is influenced by economic conditions that impact consumer spending. Many factors affect the
level of consumer spending on our products, including the state of the economy as a whole, stock market
performance, interest rates, currency exchange rates, recession, inflation, deflation, political uncertainty, the
availability of consumer credit, taxation, unemployment and other matters that influence consumer confidence.
For example, discretionary spending generally declines during periods of economic uncertainty. In a prolonged
economic downturn, we may experience declining sales as a result of general reduced consumer spending. These
trends also affect the business of our wholesale customers, which in turn has an adverse impact on our revenues
from these distribution channels.

Since early 2020, the primary factor in increased uncertainty globally from an economic and social
perspective has been the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in materially
increased volatility and declines in financial markets and weaker demand in the global economy. Measures
implemented, or intended to be implemented, by governments or governmental bodies in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on supply chains resulting, for
instance, in plant closures or increases in the cost of raw materials, and generally impact business operations
across the economy both as a result of weakened economic activity and the employees being affected. See
“—Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely
_affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.” Furthermore, global economic conditions have been, and are likely to_
continue to be, affected by concerns over increased geopolitical tensions as well as political developments, such
as the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020, and the threat of
escalated trade disputes on a global level. See also “—Uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s
_withdrawal from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business.”_

It is difficult to predict how economic conditions will develop, as they are impacted by macro movements of
the financial markets and many other factors, including the stock, bond and derivatives markets as well as
measures taken by various governmental and regulatory authorities and central banks. Uncertainty remains in the
global markets and the global economy could experience another recession, or a depression, which could be more
prolonged or have a greater financial impact than the global recessions that began in 2008. Any downturns in
general economic conditions that impact consumer spending, particularly in the countries where we sell a
significant portion of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_We face intense competition from both established companies and newer entrants into the market, and our_**
**_failure to compete effectively could have a negative impact on our sales and our reputation._**

The footwear and accessories industries are very competitive, and we expect to continue to face intense
competitive pressures. Competitive factors that affect our market position include our ability to predict and
respond to changing consumer preferences and tastes in a timely manner, continuing to market and develop new
products that appeal to consumers, our ability to accurately predict customer demand and ensure product
availability, the strength and recognition of the Birkenstock brand, pricing our products competitively, managing
the impact of the rapidly changing retail environment and the expansion of our online presence, and our
marketing, advertising and distribution efforts.

Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, more developed consumer and customer
bases, more comprehensive product lines and greater distribution capabilities, and may spend substantially more
on product advertising and endorsements. Our competitors may also own more recognized brands, implement
more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to
potential employees and distribution partners, have a larger online presence or respond more quickly to changes
in consumer preferences. Some of our competitors may be better able to take advantage of market opportunities
and withstand market downturns better than we can. For example, we face competition from established
competitors in the ASPA and MEAI hubs, where we are a relatively new market entrant. Additionally, the
general availability of offshore footwear manufacturing capacity allows for rapid expansion by competitors and

34


-----

new entrants in the footwear market. We may be unable to compete successfully in the future, and increased
competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to
generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our development, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_If we encounter operational challenges relating to the distribution of our products, our business could be_**
**_adversely affected_**

We rely on both our own and third-party logistics centers to warehouse and ship products to our wholesale
channel, retail stores and e-commerce consumers throughout the world. These centers are subject to operational
risks, including, among other things, mechanical and IT system failure, work stoppages, increases in
transportation costs, and the impact of pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cross border trade
barriers (including as a result of Brexit), natural disasters, political crises, civil unrest and other catastrophic
events. Such disruption could have an adverse effect on the availability of our in-store and warehoused inventory
and would divert financial and management resources from beneficial uses. In addition, distribution capacity is
dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of products to and
from their distribution facilities. If we encounter problems with our distribution systems, whether our own or
third-party, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and
achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected. Additionally, the success of our e-commerce channel
and the satisfaction of consumers depend on their timely receipt of products. The efficient flow of our products
requires that our own and third-party operated distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support the current
level of e-commerce channel and any anticipated increased levels that may follow from the planned growth of
that channel. To the extent that any of these risks were to materialize, we could incur significantly higher costs
and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to consumers and experience dissatisfaction from
consumers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.

In addition, we use independent distributors to sell our products in many of our markets. Failure by our
distributors to meet planned annual sales goals or to make timely payments on amounts owed to us due to, for
example, economic difficulties faced by such distributors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial position, and it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor.
If a change in distributor becomes necessary, we may experience increased costs, as well as substantial disruption
and a resulting loss of sales and brand equity in the market where such distributor operates, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_If our relationship with one or more major wholesale partners deteriorates or terminates, our business could_**
**_be adversely affected._**

While our strategy is to continue to grow our DTC sales channel, and in particular our e-commerce channel,
our ability to attract and retain strategic wholesale partners remains critical to our continued success and growth.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our wholesale channel accounted for 68.2% of our revenues,
with our top ten wholesale partners accounting for 16.7% of our revenues for the same period.

While our agreements with our wholesale partners generally run indefinitely as a form of framework
agreement, purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. If any major wholesale partner decreases or
ceases purchasing from us, cancels its orders, reduces the floor space, assortments, fixtures or advertising for our
products or changes the manner of doing business with us for any reason, such actions could adversely affect our
business. In addition, a decline in the performance or financial condition of a major wholesale partner, including
bankruptcy or liquidation, could result in a material loss of revenues to us and cause us to limit or discontinue
business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to our receivables from that customer
or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that customer. As a precautionary matter
in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have requested certain wholesale partners pay deposits for their orders.
These measures and other measures we may adopt to mitigate credit risk, however, may not be successful. In
addition, retail consolidation could lead to fewer wholesale partners, wholesale partners seeking more favorable
price, payment or other terms from us and a decrease in the number of stores that carry our products. While we
seek to insure credit risk, there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to obtain credit risk
insurance at commercially attractive terms or at all.

If our relationship with one or more major wholesale partners deteriorates or terminates, or if other changes
occur in the wholesale channel that adversely impact our relationships with distributors and other third parties,

35


-----

this could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_Tariffs and other changes in foreign trade policy could adversely affect our business and results of operations_**
**_in the future._**

Materials and products imported into the European Union, the United States and other countries are subject
to import duties. While we have implemented internal measures to comply with applicable customs regulations
and to properly calculate the import duties applicable to imported products, customs authorities may disagree
with our claimed tariff treatment for certain products, resulting in unexpected costs that may not have been
factored into the sales price of such products and our expected margins. In addition, we cannot predict whether
future domestic and foreign laws, regulations, or specific or broad trade remedy actions, or international
agreements may impose additional duties or other restrictions on the importation of products from one or more of
our sourcing venues. Any such changes in legislation and government policy may have a material adverse effect
on our business, including the imposition of tariffs on certain materials which could increase our product costs.
For example, in recent periods, the US government has announced various import tariffs on goods imported from
certain trade partners, such as the European Union and China, which have resulted and may continue to result in
reciprocal tariffs on goods exported from the United States to such trade partners. Trade barriers and other
governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements around the world have the potential to
decrease demand for our products, negatively impact suppliers and adversely impact the economies in which we
operate. Trade barriers and other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements could
increase the cost of raw materials and components used in certain of our products, which could in turn increase
our cost of goods sold, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_Any adverse events influencing either the sustainability of the supply chain or our relationship with any major_**
**_supplier, or any increases in the costs of raw materials, could adversely affect our business._**

Our ability to competitively price our products depends on the cost of components, services, labor,
equipment and raw materials, including leather and materials used in the production of our products. The cost of
services and materials is subject to change based on availability and market conditions that are difficult to
predict. Various conditions, such as diseases affecting the availability of leather, affect the cost of the footwear
marketed by us. In addition, fuel prices and numerous other factors, such as the possibility of service
interruptions at shipping and receiving ports, affect our shipping costs. Most of our raw materials are natural
products or have major natural ingredients (e.g., leather, cork, jute, latex). However, only very few are actually
traded as commodities (e.g., steel, latex). We use certain indices as references for price developments, and factors
such as weather and climate conditions, demand of competing industries (e.g., leather for car manufacturers,
furniture) and general economic factors such as supply and demand and raw material price developments will
affect the cost of our materials.

We source components and other raw materials (including leather, ethylene-vinyl acetate (“EVA”), cork,
adhesives, natural latex, jute, copper, wool felt and brass buckles) from over 140 suppliers located mainly in
Europe, but also in Turkey, the Americas and Asia. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our top 14
suppliers accounted for approximately 60% of our supply costs of raw materials, semi-finished goods, auxiliary
and packing. Generally, we aim to source our materials from multiple suppliers and have policies to prevent
dependence on any single supplier. However, for certain materials, we may rely on specific suppliers that are
able to meet the level of quality and supply we require. For example, although our leathers are sourced from
different tanneries, our requirement for materials of high quality may result in reducing the pool of available
tanneries that can meet such requirements. In addition, some of our products use materials of high technical
complexity and high-quality standards, such as EVA granules, or that require specific IP rights, such as the EVA
buckles. We also have some regional dependencies. For example, while we do have multiple cork suppliers, they
are all based in Portugal, thus creating a specific geographical dependency, and we have similar regional
dependencies for other of our raw materials. Our relationships with suppliers are either based on individual
purchase orders, on purchase orders governed by a framework agreement, or on separate agreements governing
the conditions for the supply of specific materials. Although our contracts with these suppliers contain provisions
that ensure the supplier is not able to terminate the contract on short notice, should one or more of these suppliers
be unable to supply or decide to cease supplying us with raw materials and components, or decide to increase
prices significantly due to price increases, shortages or for other reasons that may be beyond our control, we may
be unable to identify alternative suppliers of such materials at a reasonable cost or at all and, in any event, it may

36


-----

take a significant period of time to receive any materials from alternative suppliers. Moreover, if we expand
beyond the production capacity of our current suppliers as we continue to grow, we may not be able to find new
suppliers with an appropriate level of expertise and capacity in a timely manner.

Our supply chain could also be materially adversely affected by a number of other factors, including, among
other things, potential economic and political instability in countries where our suppliers are located, increases in
shipping or other transportation costs, manufacturing and transportation delays and interruptions, whether as a
result of natural disasters or force majeure events (including without limitation unrest, civil disorder, war,
terrorist attacks, subversive activities or sabotage, fires, floods, explosions, other catastrophes, epidemics or
pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic), industrial action in the supply chain or other factors, supplier
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and changes in
laws affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the
enforcement of those laws. We may also be subject to potential reputational damage if one or more of our
suppliers violates or is alleged to have violated applicable laws or regulations including improper labor
conditions or human rights abuses, fails to meet our requirements or does not meet industry standards and safety
specifications.

Any of these risks, in isolation or in combination, could restrict the availability of merchandise or
significantly increase the cost of such merchandise, require us to divert financial and management resources from
more beneficial uses and subject us to reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_If we are unable to effectively execute our direct-to-consumer growth strategy, our business and prospects may_**
**_be harmed._**

Since 2016, we significantly expanded our direct-to-consumer sales channels through the expansion of our
e-commerce channel, particularly in the United States. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020,
e-commerce sales represented 28% of our revenues. It is one of our strategies to continue to increase the
proportion of our revenues from our e-commerce channel.

The success of our e-commerce channel depends, in part, on our ability to offer attractive, reliable, secure
and user-friendly online platforms for consumers across our markets, including by continuing to invest in our
digital infrastructure and digital team. However, our e-commerce business also depends on factors over which we
have limited control, including changing consumer preferences and buying trends. Any failure by us, or by any of
our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure and user-friendly online platforms could
negatively impact the shopping experience of consumers, resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty
to the Birkenstock brand and lost sales. In addition, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of
our e-commerce channel, sales from our retail stores and wholesale channel in areas in which we introduce
online stores may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and digital cannibalization.

We are also subject to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce platforms,
including changes in required technology interfaces; website downtime and other technical failures; costs and
technical issues from website software upgrades; data and system security; computer viruses; and changes in
applicable federal and state regulations. We also must keep up to date with competitive technology trends,
including, among other things, the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other
e-commerce marketing tools, such as paid and unpaid search, and mobile applications, which may increase our
costs, and which may not succeed in increasing sales or attracting consumers. In addition, the use of credit and
debit cards in our online platform, which are handled by external service providers, are subject to rules relating to
the processing of credit card payments.

Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. See also “—Our operations, products, systems and services rely on complex
_information technology (“IT”) systems and networks that are subject to the risk of disruption and security_
_breaches.”_

**_Our business is affected by seasonality and weather conditions, which could result in fluctuations in our_**
**_operating results._**

Our products, particularly our sandals, are suited for warm weather. If the weather conditions vary
significantly from typical conditions, such as an unusually cold summer, consumer demand for our products
could be adversely affected. As a result, our business is subject to seasonal peaks. Between October and March,

37


-----

we manufacture sandals and shoes for the wholesale channel, and during the first few months of the calendar year
we rely on our built-up stock for our sales to wholesale partners. Starting in March and during the warmer
months of the year, demand for our products from direct-to-consumer channels increases. In the year ended
September 30, 2020, 54.9% of our sales occurred in the second half of the financial year (March to September).
We incur significant additional expenses in advance of and during this period in anticipation of higher sales
during that period, including the cost of additional inventory, which is stored on palettes in our warehouses until
shipped, fixed cost such as rent and lease agreement for retail shops and outlets as well as depreciation and
amortization of production plants that were temporarily closed.

Lower demand may result in excess inventory, which may require us to sell these products at discounted
prices or to build up more finished goods inventory than expected incurring additional costs, which could, in
turn, adversely affect our results of operations. At the same time, if we fail to manufacture a sufficient quantity of
merchandise, we may not have an adequate supply of products to meet consumer demand or if weather
conditions permit us to sell seasonal products early in the season, this may reduce inventory levels needed to
meet customers’ needs later in that same season, which could have a negative impact on our sales during our
busiest season. In addition, we are currently pursuing a strategy to reduce our amount of inventory by
transitioning to a more demand-based production model rather than pre-production based on internal estimates,
which may increase this risk in the short-term as we make this transition. Any inability to effectively manage
seasonality and weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_Our operating results depend on effectively managing inventory levels, and any excess inventories or_**
**_inventory shortages could harm our business._**

Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability, and our
ability to manage our inventories effectively is an important factor in our operations. Inventory shortages can
impede our ability to meet demand, adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers, and, consequently,
diminish brand loyalty and decrease sales. We are currently pursuing a strategy to reduce our amount of
inventory by transitioning to a more demand-based production model rather than pre-production based on
internal estimates, which may increase these risks in the short-term as we make this transition. Conversely,
excess inventories can result in lower gross margins if we lower prices in order to liquidate excess inventories. In
addition, inventory may become obsolete as a result of changes in consumer preferences or otherwise. Also, if
our production decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions, we may have to take
unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial
results. In addition, customers, including distributors, may cancel certain pre-orders, which could increase this
risk if a large amount of cancellations were to occur. Any inability to effectively manage our inventory could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are subject to risks associated with international markets._**

As we market, sell and manufacture our products in many countries, we face a variety of risks generally
associated with doing business in international markets and importing merchandise from these regions including,
among others, changes in the rate of economic growth, political instability resulting in the disruption of trade,
trade disputes, expropriation or other governmental action, quotas and other trade regulations, export license
requirements, delays associated with customs procedures, including increased security requirements applicable to
foreign goods and measures related to COVID-19, Brexit, social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed
conflict, imposition of confiscatory taxation or adverse taxes, other charges and restrictions on imports, currency
and exchange rate risks, changes in double tax treaties, risks related to labor practices increasing minimum wages
and inflationary pressures, national and regional labor strikes, bribery and corruption, environmental matters or
other issues in the foreign countries or factories in which our products are manufactured, risk of loss at sea or
other delays in the delivery of products caused by transportation problems, and increased costs of transportation.

We also sell our products and have operations in emerging markets, including Brazil, India and certain
countries in Africa. Our operations in countries with less developed or less predictable legal systems present
several risks, including legal uncertainty, bribery and corruption, civil disturbances, economic and governmental
instability, different business and operating practices, differing consumer behaviors and preferences and the
imposition of exchange controls. The uncertainty of the legal environment in these countries, in particular with
respect to the enforcement of intellectual property rights, could limit our ability to enforce our rights and grow
our business. In addition, we or any of our distributors or wholesale partners may be subject to legal proceedings
regarding bribery and corruption in these countries, and we are unable to monitor the lawful conduct of our
distributors and wholesale partners’ operations.

38

Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our, business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_If we are unable to adequately protect, maintain and enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property_**
**_rights, or if we infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our business would be materially_**
**_adversely affected._**

We own a large portfolio of international intellectual property (“IP”) rights. Our business is dependent on
our ability to protect and promote our trademarks and other IP rights. The BIRKENSTOCK brand is our most
material IP asset. We strictly enforce against any products and fake shops that might be infringing our IP rights,
including seizure measures. We cannot be sure that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our
trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to protect our rights, or that any of our intellectual
property will not be challenged or held invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to prevent imitation of
our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the
trademarks and proprietary rights of others. Third parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to
counterfeit our brand and trademarks, otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights or try to challenge the
validity of our intellectual property. In addition, third parties may try to sell their counterfeited products through
online platforms and marketplaces, taking advantage of business practices applicable to open market operating
models. Should counterfeit products be successfully sold on e-commerce platforms managed by third parties, our
brands and reputation could be severely damaged, and our revenues could be impacted. In addition, we have
refrained, and we may in the future refrain, from using third party websites to distribute our products due to the
selling of counterfeited products in such platforms. As a result, there could be a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We may not always be able to secure protection for, or stop infringements of, our intellectual property, and
may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Our failure to protect our trademarks
could diminish the value of our brands, and could cause customer or consumer confusion. Any litigation or
dispute involving the scope or enforceability of our intellectual property rights, however, as well as any
allegation that we infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, could be costly and time-consuming
and, if determined adversely to us, result in harm to our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

Furthermore, we cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe,
misappropriate or otherwise conflict with the intellectual property rights of others, and our efforts to enforce our
trademark and other intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits
attacking the validity and enforceability of our trademark and other intellectual property rights. Any action to
prosecute, enforce or defend any intellectual property claim, regardless of merit or resolution, could be costly and
may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in such
proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If we
are found to have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated rights of third parties, we could be required to
pay substantial damages, obtain licenses, cease the manufacture, use or sale of certain intellectual property, or
cease making or selling certain products. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in protecting and enforcing our intellectual
property, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_Our business is subject to changes in consumer preferences, and if we are unsuccessful in adapting to any_**
**_such changes, it may adversely impact our business._**

Our continued success depends in part on the continued attractiveness of the design, styling, production,
merchandising and pricing of our products to consumers. Our products must appeal to a consumer base whose
preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change as our industries are subject to sudden
shifts in consumer trends and spending. Over the brand’s 250 year history, we have experienced fluctuations in
consumer demand for our products, and our success depends in large part on our ability to develop, market and
deliver innovative and stylish products at a pace, intensity, and price competitive with other brands in the
markets in which we sell our products. Failure on our part to adequately predict and respond timely to consumer
demand and market conditions and to regularly and rapidly develop innovative and stylish products and update
core products could limit sales growth, adversely affect consumer acceptance of our products, and if consumer
demand for our iconic footwear decreases in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

-----

In addition, to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with
our suppliers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. If we misjudge the market for our
products, we may be faced with excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for others. If we
are unable to predict or respond to sales demand or to changing styles or trends successfully, our sales could be
lower. We may also experience inventory shortfalls on unexpectedly popular products, which would also result in
reduced sales. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to distribute and market new products
efficiently or that any product category that we may expand or introduce will achieve sales levels sufficient to
generate profits. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_Our future growth depends on our successful marketing efforts, and any failure in our ability to increase or_**
**_enhance our marketing activities and capabilities could adversely affect demand for our products._**

Our success and future growth depends on our ability to attract and retain consumers, which in part depends
on our marketing practices. Our future growth efforts depend, in part, upon the effectiveness and efficiency of
our marketing efforts, including our ability to continue to improve brand awareness, identify the most effective
brand messaging and efficient levels of spending in each market, determine the appropriate creative messages
and media mix for marketing and promotional expenditure, and effectively manage marketing costs. In
particular, we may need to increase our marketing spend in order to take advantage of growth opportunities in
our growth markets, particularly in Asia. We may also be required to increase marketing spend in order to
develop our e-commerce channel consistent with our strategy. Any factors adversely affecting our ability to
increase or enhance our marketing activities and capabilities could adversely affect demand for our products and
in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Our ability to successfully operate retail stores depends on many factors._**

Our ability to successfully operate our retail stores depends on many factors, including, among others, our
ability to negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired rent and tenant improvement allowances; achieve
brand awareness, affinity and purchase intent in our markets; achieve increased sales and gross margins at our
stores; hire, train and retain store associates and field management; assimilate store associates and field
management into our corporate culture; and source and supply sufficient inventory levels. Even after COVID-19
pandemic lockdown measures are lifted, social distancing measures may continue to remain in place, which
would negatively affect the operations of our retail stores and the attractiveness of the retail experience for our
customers. If we are unable to successfully operate any of our retail stores due to our failure to satisfy any of
these factors, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely
affected. Any failure to successfully operate our retail stores could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our non-footwear products face distinct risks, and our failure to successfully manage these businesses could_**
**_have a negative impact on our profitability_**

In addition to our core footwear products, our product offering includes accessories, cosmetics and
furniture. The successful operation and expansion of these products are subject to certain business and
operational risks that are different from those we experience with our footwear products, including an intense
competitive environment, where we face a number of large and specialized competitors with an established
market presence. A failure to successfully manage these products could result in increased costs and a reduction
of sales affecting our profitability, as well as damage to our reputation and brands, which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our success depends substantially on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain experienced management and_**
**_personnel._**

Our management team has substantial expertise and industry experience and the loss of key members of
management could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic objectives. Further, we are also
dependent on personnel that are highly skilled and qualified in the consumer goods industry as well as in design,
merchandising and digital activities.

Our success in attracting and retaining such personnel depends on a variety of factors, including the supply
of qualified candidates in the relevant market, as well as our compensation and benefit programs, work
environment, career development opportunities, commitment to diversity and public image. Competition for

40


-----

qualified personnel is increasing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining
experienced management and key technical personnel and any failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations._**

We operate and sell products globally, and, as a result, we generate a portion of our sales and incur a portion
of our expenses in currencies other than our functional currency, euro, which are primarily U.S. dollars, Japanese
yen, British pounds and Canadian dollars. As a result of our significant presence in the United States, we are
particularly exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar, and following the Transactions, a
large portion of our indebtedness will be denominated in U.S. dollars. In the twelve months ended December 31,
2020, approximately 52% of our sales were in currencies other than euro. Accordingly, movements in exchange
rates between any of these currencies and the euro could have a negative effect on our results of operations and
financial condition to the extent there is a mismatch between our earnings in any foreign currency and our costs
that are denominated in that currency.

Where possible, we manage foreign currency risk by matching same currency revenues to same currency
expenses. However, we are exposed to risk as a result of the increasing amount of invoicing being done in local
currency, particularly our subsidiaries in the United States. Such currency risks are monitored by our senior
management in the context of annual budgeting and the hedging strategy is adjusted from time to time during the
course of the year. In the past three years the hedging arrangements for euro to U.S. dollar covered approximately
between 50% to 70% of the expected U.S. dollar exposure. There is no guarantee that our hedging strategy will
be successful.

In addition, while we report our results in euro, we have revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities in other
currencies, primarily as the result of our ownership of our subsidiaries located in other countries. Our
subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities are converted based on the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and income
statement items are converted based on the average exchange rate during the relevant financial period. Exchange
rates have seen significant fluctuation in recent years, and significant increases in the value of the euro relative to
such currencies could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. As a result, any
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_Unforeseen business interruptions at our production facilities or other operational problems may lead to_**
**_production bottlenecks or project delays._**

Our success depends on the uninterrupted and reliable operation of our manufacturing operations.
Unforeseen disruption of a production facility could be caused by a number of events, including a maintenance
outage, power or equipment failure, fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural disasters, social unrest or terrorist
activity, work stoppages, public health concerns (including pandemics), regulatory measures or other operational
problems. For instance, four of our manufacturing facilities experienced temporary shutdowns due to COVID-19
in 2020.

A prolonged disruption at a manufacturing facility could result in production downtimes or temporary
operation at reduced capacity preventing us from completing production in a timely manner, leading to loss of
business volume, and reduced productivity or profitability at a particular production site. Even less severe
problems involving our production facilities, such as missed shipment dates, split shipments, defective software
or materials, or logistics problems, could lead to delays.

Any unplanned production downtime, stoppage at our facilities or project sites, serious accidents or other
operational problems and delays, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our reliance on services arrangements with third-party service providers exposes us to a range of potential_**
**_operational risks._**

We have entered into a number of services arrangements with third-party service providers for the operation
of distribution centers. In addition, we have entered into a service agreement with a third-party provider in
Portugal, for the outsourcing of closed shoes production. In the event the services of these service providers are
disrupted or terminated and we do not engage suitable replacements on commercially acceptable terms or in a
timely manner, we may not be able to effectively deliver our products to consumers and wholesale partner, which
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are subject to various regulations governing the use and processing of personal data, and any failure to_**
**_protect confidential information could harm our reputation and expose us to litigation._**

We collect, process, transmit and store personal, sensitive and confidential information, including our
proprietary business information and that of consumers (including users of our websites) and our wholesale
partners, distributors, employees, suppliers and business partners. The protection of customer, employee and
company data is critical to us. Customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal
information from cyberattack or other security breaches. A significant breach of customer, employee, or
company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. The secure processing,
maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our
security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or
breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach or attack could compromise
our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Because the
methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be
unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such access, disclosure or
other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy
of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers and damage our
reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.

In addition, in light of our collection, use and processing of personal data, we are subject to a number of
laws relating to privacy and data protection, including the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU)
2016/679) (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other applicable data protection and privacy
laws across our various markets. Such laws govern our ability to collect, use and transfer personal data, including
relating to consumers and business partners, as well as any such data relating to employees and others. We
routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information (including debit or credit card
details of consumers) by electronic means and therefore rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission
of such information in line with regulatory requirements. Therefore, we are exposed to the risk that such data
could be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, damaged or processed in breach of privacy or data protection
laws which could lead to the imposition of fines or regulatory action, together with associated negative publicity.
For example, breaches of the GDPR can result in significant fines based on percentages of our annual global
turnover. Any perceived or actual failure by us, including our third-party service providers, to protect
confidential data or any material non-compliance with privacy or data protection or other consumer protection
laws or regulations may harm our reputation and credibility, adversely affect revenue, reduce our ability to attract
and retain customers and consumers, result in litigation or other actions being brought against us and the
imposition of significant fines and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Compliance with existing laws and regulations or changes in any such laws and regulations could affect our_**
**_business_**

We operate in a range of international markets and are subject to a variety of laws and regulations and we
routinely incur costs in complying with these laws and regulations. New laws or regulations or changes in
existing laws and regulations, particularly those governing the sale of products or in other regulatory areas such
as consumer credit, labor and employment, tax, competition, health and safety or environmental protection, may
conceivably require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could
increase our cost of doing business. See also “—We are subject to various regulations governing the use and
_processing of personal data, and any failure to protect confidential information could harm our reputation and_
_expose us to litigation.”_

For example, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the use of hazardous materials in our
footwear production processes. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may face fines, penalties
or other sanctions, as well as resulting in damage to our image and brand. In addition, we could incur future
expenditures to remediate past compliance failures that could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, changes in laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement or alternative interpretation of
existing laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we currently operate can change the legal and regulatory
environment, making compliance with all applicable laws and regulations more challenging. Various
governments and intergovernmental organizations could introduce proposals for tax legislation, or adopt tax law,
that may have an adverse effect on our worldwide effective tax rate, or increase our tax liability, the carrying

42


-----

value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. Changes in laws and regulations in the future could
have an adverse economic impact on us by tightening restrictions, reducing our freedom to do business,
increasing our costs of doing business, or reducing our profitability. In addition, the compliance costs associated
with such evolving laws and regulations may be significant. Failure to comply with applicable laws or
regulations can lead to civil, administrative or criminal penalties, including but not limited to fines or the
revocation of permits and licenses that may be necessary for our business activities. We could also be required to
pay damages or civil judgments in respect of third-party claims.

Any of these developments, alone or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Incidents at our production sites or finishing and distribution centers may cause environmental or other third_**
**_party damages._**

We directly operate five production facilities and two distribution warehouses in Germany, and rely on three
warehouses managed by external partners in Germany, in addition to a distribution network managed by third
parties with warehouses in the United States, Canada, Brazil, China and Japan. Incidents at our production
facilities and warehouses could result in injury to our employees, third parties, or environmental damage, such as
damage resulting from the accidental discharge of hazardous materials used in our production process.

Our product development and manufacturing processes involve the use of chemicals and other hazardous
materials, such as (but not limited to) zinc oxide, drain star, acetate, diesel, and steel care sprays. These programs
and processes expose us to risks of accidental contamination, events of non-compliance with environmental,
health and safety laws and regulatory enforcement, personal injury, property damage and claims and litigation. If
an accident occurs, or if contamination is discovered, we could be liable for clean-up obligations, damages or
fines and could incur significant capital expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, the environmental laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose obligations to clean
up contaminated sites. These obligations may relate to sites that we acquire, own or operate, that we formerly
owned or operated, or for which we may otherwise have retained liability or where waste from our operations
was disposed. Were such environmental clean-up obligations to arise, they could significantly reduce our
profitability. In particular, any financial accruals which we may make for these obligations might be insufficient
if the assumptions underlying the accruals prove to be incorrect, or if we are held responsible for additional
contamination.

We are also subject to various foreign and local laws and regulations pertaining to occupational health and
safety that require us to maintain a safe workplace environment, maintain documentation of work-related
injuries, illnesses and fatalities, complete workers’ compensation loss reports, review the status of outstanding
workers’ compensation claims and complete certain annual filings and postings. Failure to comply with these and
other applicable occupational health and safety requirements could result in fines and penalties, and could require
us to undertake certain remedial actions or be subject to suspension of certain operations. From time to time, our
employees are involved in health and safety-related incidents at our production facilities. These incidents have
resulted and could result in the future in regulatory investigations and penalties, as well as regulatory and private
claims. For example, the Rhineland-Palatinate Structure and Approval Directorate, a regional government
agency, conducted in 2019 an inspection at our Strödt production facility, after a safety incident involving a
riveting machine. Following the inspection, the governmental agency required us to implement certain
remediation actions, which we promptly instituted.

Stricter environmental, health and safety laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and
liabilities for us, and could result in the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants
being subject to greater scrutiny by relevant regulatory authorities than is currently the case. Compliance with
these laws could result in significant capital expenditures, as well as other costs, thereby potentially having a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We rely on our suppliers, agents and distributors to comply with employment, environmental and other laws_**
**_and regulations._**

We have put in place policies and procedures, including audits and our Code of Conduct, to ensure that our
suppliers are in material compliance with our business terms, as well as employment, environmental and other
relevant laws and regulations generally. We include the Code of Conduct as a mandatory component of all new

43


-----

and extended procurement agreement and we also implement similar procedures as part of new distribution and
wholesale agreements. However, we can give no assurance that our suppliers, agents and distributors are or will
remain in compliance with such contractual terms, laws or regulations, or that our audits will be sufficient in
scope or frequency for us to become aware of any such non-compliance on a timely basis or at all. A violation, or
allegations of a violation, of such laws or regulations, or failure to achieve particular standards, by any of these
individuals or entities could lead to financial penalties, adverse publicity or a decline in public demand for our
products, which could have a material adverse impact on our brand or reputation. Furthermore, any
non-compliance could require us to incur expenditures or make changes to our supply chain and other business
arrangements to ensure compliance. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our operations, products, systems and services rely on complex information technology (“IT”) systems and_**
**_networks that are subject to the risk of disruption and security breaches._**

We heavily rely on IT systems and networks to support our e-commerce channel and for research,
procurement, manufacturing, sales, logistics, business and other processes including, among others, inventory
tracking, and transaction recording and processing. The consistent, efficient and secure operation of IT is
therefore critical to the successful performance of our operations and the products we sell.

Despite IT maintenance and security measures, our IT systems and networks are exposed to the risk of
malfunctions and interruptions from a variety of sources, including equipment damage, deficient database design,
power outages, computer viruses and a range of other hardware, software and network problems. We have
experienced temporary outages in our IT systems in the past. Although we have countermeasures in place to
prevent malfunctions and interruptions, any such malfunctions or interruptions could compromise the operational
integrity of these systems and networks should our countermeasures fail in the future.

In addition, we rely on systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of
proprietary or confidential information regarding our consumers, customers, suppliers, employees and others,
including credit card information and personal information. We also store data in third-party data centers and use
third-party servers or applications by means of cloud computing. As the importance of our e-commerce channel
continues to increase, the salience of this risk has increased.

Our systems, websites, data (wherever stored), software or networks, and those of third parties (including
data centers), are vulnerable to security breaches, including unauthorized access (from within our organization or
by third parties), computer viruses or other malicious code and other cyber threats that could have a security
impact. We may not be able to anticipate evolving techniques used to effect security breaches (which change
frequently and may not be known until launched), or prevent attacks by hackers, including phishing or other
cyber-attacks, or prevent breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, in a timely manner, or at all.
Cyber-attacks have become far more prevalent in the past few years, leading potentially to the theft or
manipulation of confidential and proprietary information or loss of access to, or destruction of, data on our or
third-party systems, as well as interruptions or malfunctions in our or third parties’ operations.

In addition, our IT systems have been in the past, or in the future may be, the target of cyber-attacks or other
security breaches. For instance, we use order, fulfillment and customer relationship management systems as part
of our e-commerce operations and other sales channel, and human resource management systems as part of our
employee services and payroll processes, and such systems may be subject to security breaches. We implement
mitigation measures from time to time, as we identify new threats and risks. We cannot assure you that such
measures will be effective or that breaches or other cyber-attacks, including industrial espionage or ransomware
attacks will not occur in the future. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and remediate security breaches,
including attacks on our IT infrastructure by hackers, viruses, employee error or misconduct, or other disruptions
could seriously harm our operations and the operations of our customers. Such breaches may result, among other
things, in unauthorized access to trade secrets, confidential business information and personal information, data
losses, business interruptions, non-compliance with legal requirements, legal claims or proceedings, deterioration
in customer relationships and reputational harm. See also “—We are subject to various regulations governing the
_use and processing of personal data, and any failure to protect confidential information could harm our_
_reputation and expose us to litigation.” In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats, we_
cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident, and the cost and operational expense of implementing,
maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber
threats could increase significantly. While we regularly review our network security, backup and disaster
recovery, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data, security measures

44


-----

cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every
breach or disruption on a timely basis.

Furthermore, certain measures we may undertake to update our IT systems may be subject to works
councils’ codetermination rights. While works councils have been co-operative in the past, a potentially
extensive exercise of these co-determination rights may result in operational difficulties and in us being
prevented from implementing planned policy or IT system changes. See “—We are dependent on good
_relationships with our employees and employee representative bodies and stakeholders.”_

Any disruptions of our IT systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks and industrial espionage, may
disrupt operations, or result in legal liability. The materialization of any of the above risks could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_The pricing of cross border transactions is often the subject of negotiation with tax authorities, and any_**
**_adjustments imposed may lead to the greater or double taxation of profits._**

Most national tax authorities follow the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or
United Nations guidelines when considering the arm’s length nature of cross border pricing of goods and
services. Adjustments made by a national tax authority may not lead to a corresponding adjustment in the other
tax jurisdiction. Also, even where a corresponding tax adjustment is allowed, national tax rates may be different
and may therefore increase our overall burden of taxation. Our cross border trade is increasing and, although we
benchmark our intercompany pricing regularly, the risk of an adverse adjustment will require constant
monitoring, which may require a substantial amount of management resources. Potential discrepancies in the
adjustments made by the tax authorities in certain jurisdictions may result in an increased tax burden on our
Group.

**_We may be exposed to transfer price risks in connection with our operating activities._**

We take advantage of our international network and centralize our strategic functions. In particular, we
transfer and provide goods and services among the companies of the Group by adopting a corporate tax transfer
frame model for the billing of intercompany services. There is a risk that tax authorities in individual countries
will assess the relevant transfer prices differently from our tax transfer pricing model and address retroactive tax
claims against one of our companies. While our tax transfer pricing model has been agreed between the
competent authorities in certain countries, in others such model is still under discussion with the authorities. For
example, transfer pricing agreements are currently under discussion between the German and the Italian tax
authorities. There can be no assurance that our transfer prices will be accepted by all the relevant authorities. If
they fail to be accepted, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
and ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to complex tax laws, and changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely_**
**_affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax positions, including our effective tax rate or tax
payments. We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. We cannot
be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax
positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay
taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes,
which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition,
operating results and cash flows.

**_We are exposed to tax risks, which could arise in particular as a result of tax audits or past measures._**

Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to income and other taxes in multiple jurisdictions.
Significant judgement and estimation are required in determining our calculation and provision for income, sales,
value-add and other taxes, including withholding taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are various
transactions, including, for example, intercompany transactions based on cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing and
transactions with specific documentation requirements, for all of which the ultimate tax assessment or the timing
of the tax effect is uncertain. We are regularly audited by tax authorities, and our tax calculations and our
interpretation of laws are reviewed by tax authorities which may disagree with our tax estimates or judgements.
We are currently undergoing a tax audit with respect to the FY 2016 and FY 2017. Although we believe our tax
estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any such tax audits or reviews could differ from our tax

45


-----

provisions and accruals and any additional tax liabilities resulting from such final determination or any interest or
any penalties or any regulatory, administrative or other sanctions relating thereto could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

While we attempt to assess in advance the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these
proceedings or claims it is difficult to predict final outcomes with any degree of certainty. The final
determination of any tax investigation, tax audit, tax review, tax litigation, and appeal of a tax authority’s
decision or similar proceedings may differ materially from our estimate or which is reflected in our financial
statements. An adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
result of operations. In addition, changes in tax legislation or guidance could result in additional taxes and/or
affect our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities. Any tax audit, tax
proceeding or changes in tax legislation or guidance could, as a result of the realization of any of the above risks,
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, certain entities in our Group were in the past or are currently part of fiscal unities, tax groups
and other tax consolidation schemes. We cannot ensure that these entities will not be held liable for unpaid taxes
of the members of such tax consolidation schemes (including members outside of our group) under statutory law
or the contracts which formed or form the basis for the tax consolidation schemes. Furthermore, should such tax
consolidation schemes not be accepted by the tax authorities and/or a tax court, taxes, interest and penalties may
be imposed against entities of our group. Such liabilities may be substantial and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

**_We are subject to the risk of litigation and other claims._**

In the ordinary course of our business we are, or may from time to time become, involved in various
litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations, prosecutions or similar matters arising out of
our current or future business, including personal injury, wrongful death claims, property damages and product
liability claims, warranty obligations claims, alleged violations of environmental, health and safety laws criminal
proceedings (such as those relating to injuries suffered by our employees, which could result in criminal
liabilities of our legal representatives and administrative penalties against us), labor law related claims by
employees, temporary workers, or other external workers, claims by distributors, advisors and others. In addition,
third-party litigation, including litigation related to competition law, anti-trust law, tax law and patent law could
have an indirect, materially adverse impact on us and the market environment in which we operate. When we
determine that a significant risk of a future claim against us exists, we record provisions in an amount equal to
our estimated liability. As of September 30, 2020, we set aside total provisions for disputes in an amount of
€1.5 million. Our insurance or indemnities or amounts we have provisioned may not cover all claims that may be
asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our
reputation.

As of the date of this offering memorandum and generally in the ordinary course of business, we are
involved in several general litigation claims, as described in “Business—Legal Proceedings.” As a result of the
proceedings described therein, the amount of total provisions for disputes in our financial statements for future
periods could increase. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or
future litigation claims or similar matters under various laws or that product specific provisions will be sufficient
to cover litigation costs. Moreover, it may be difficult for us to obtain and enforce claims related to existing
litigation under the laws of certain countries in which we operate at affordable costs and without any materially
adverse effects on our business in such country. In the aftermath of public health measures implemented in the
jurisdictions in which we operate as well as our temporary personnel initiatives due to the impact of COVID-19,
we could be subject to an increase in litigation, in particular in relation to our suppliers and our employees,
including with respect to health and safety measures.

Any of these risks could result in considerable costs, including damages, legal fees and temporary or
permanent bans on the marketing of certain products and this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We have to rely on a compliance system to prevent irregularities in business activities. Failure to comply with_**
**_anti-corruption regulations and economic sanctions programs could result in fines, criminal penalties and an_**
**_adverse effect on our business._**

We operate and sell products in, and source materials from, a number of countries throughout the world,
including countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are subject to the risk that we, our affiliated

46

entities or our or their respective officers, managers, directors, employees and agents may take action determined
to be in violation of anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K.
Bribery Act of 2010 and others. Our employees may be tempted to win business with illegal practices, in
particular corruption, certain sales incentives or violation of antitrust laws. In some of the countries in which we
operate, such practices may be the custom or expected, and our competitors may undertake such practices,
increasing the pressure on us and our employees. In addition, we are required to comply with various economic
sanctions programs, including those administered by the United Nations Security Council and the United States,
including Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”). These programs restrict
us from conducting certain transactions or dealings involving certain sanctioned countries or persons.

Although we maintain and regularly update our internal policies and procedures, which are designed to
ensure compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations, including by means of online
and in-person compliance internal trainings, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be
sufficient or that our employees, directors, managers, officers, partners, agents and service providers will not take
actions in violation of our policies and procedures (or otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws
and sanctions regulations) for which they or we may ultimately be held responsible. Violations of anti-corruption
laws and sanctions regulations could lead to financial penalties being imposed on us, limits being placed on our
activities, authorizations or licenses being revoked, damage to our reputation and other consequences that could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume
significant time and attention of our senior management. In addition, litigation or investigations relating to
alleged or suspected violations of anti-corruption laws or sanctions regulations could be costly. We cannot
guarantee that our compliance and internal controls will protect us against actions taken by our officers,
managers, directors, employees and agents that might be determined to be in violation of law.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient and insurance premiums may increase._**

We maintain insurance coverage in relation to a number of risks associated with our business activities,
including third-party (product) liability, property damage and business interruption, environmental damage,
directors and officers liability, and transport and vehicle insurance. These insurance policies may not cover all
losses or damages resulting from the materialization of any of the risks we are subject to. There can moreover be
no assurance that our insurance providers will continue to grant coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at
all. In addition, there are risks left intentionally uninsured (such as, but not limited to, customer or supplier
insolvency, industrial disputes or specific natural hazards), and we therefore have no insurance against these
events. Further, agreed limits and other restrictions (for example, exclusions) within the insurance coverage may
prove to be too low or inadequate for compensating potential damages or losses, ultimately resulting in a gap in
the insurance coverage. If we sustain damages for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage, or if we
have to pay higher insurance premiums or encounter restrictions on insurance coverage, this may have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are dependent on good relationships with our employees and employee representative bodies and_**
**_stakeholders._**

We are dependent on good relationships with our employees, employee representative bodies such as works
councils (Betriebsräte) and other stakeholders to successfully operate our business. Personnel expenses make up
a significant portion of our costs and we are obliged to comply with various works council and other agreements
that are in place with works councils and other employee representative bodies. In addition, we have a collective
bargaining agreement in one of our facilities in Germany. Employees at our German locations have traditionally
been heavily unionized and we regularly conduct, or are involved in, negotiations with the relevant employee
representative bodies. Any deterioration of these relationships could adversely impact our business operations.

While we believe that we have good relations with unions and employees generally, there can be no
assurance that our relations will not deteriorate and that we will not experience labor disputes in the future. We
have faced strikes or similar types of conflicts with trade unions and our employees in the past and may face
them again in the future. In particular, these could come up when current collective agreements expire or are to
be negotiated. Any such strikes, conflicts, work stoppages or other industrial actions may disrupt our production
and sales activities, damage our reputation and adversely affect our customer relations, which could in turn have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. There can be
no assurance that our employees will not make claims or that we will not incur work stoppages in the future,
which if they occurred, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

47


-----

Works council and collective agreements may impose obligations and restrictions on us that may adversely
affect our flexibility to undertake adjustments to our workforce, restructurings, reorganizations and similar
corporate actions. In addition, certain measures we undertake are generally subject to works councils’
codetermination rights, in particular in relation to occupational pension schemes, the implementation and use of
IT systems, variable remuneration schemes and working time systems. Potentially extensive exercise of
co-determination rights by the work councils may result in operational difficulties and in us being prevented from
implementing planned policy or IT system changes.

**_Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, civil unrest and other catastrophic events or events_**
**_outside of our control may adversely affect our business._**

Natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health
crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, civil unrest, political instability
or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, have in the past, and may in the future, adversely impact
our sales. For example, both the COVID-19 pandemic and the civil unrest in the United States in 2020, led to
reduced footfall at our retail stores as well as at other stores that are supplied by our wholesale partners in Europe
and the United States, and adversely impacted our results for the year ended September 30, 2020. In particular,
our result may be materially adversely affected by events that could generally deter consumers from shopping in
store, both in relation to retail stores directly managed by us as well as in relation to stores or outlets supplied by
our wholesale partners. Such events could also disrupt the internet or mobile networks and may also prevent or
deter consumers from shopping through our e-commerce channel, which could materially adversely affect our
sales.

In addition, if any of our facilities, including our distribution facilities, our own retail stores, the facilities or
stores of our wholesale partner, or the facilities of our suppliers, distributors or any of our other third-party
service providers, are affected by any such natural disasters, catastrophic events or other events outside of our
control, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, these types of
events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity,
globally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.

**_Leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses._**

We lease certain of our production sites, office spaces, retail spaces and storage spaces. Accordingly, we are
subject to all of the risks associated with leasing real estate. Store leases generally require us to pay a fixed
minimum rent and sometimes a variable amount based on a percentage of annual sales at that location. For
certain leases, if sales targets are not achieved or if the sales-based rent amount decreases below a certain
minimum, the lessor may terminate the lease agreement, unless we agree to an increased fixed fee rent.
Moreover, in relation to lease agreements entered into for retail space in shopping or outlet centers, we also
entered into a service and marketing agreement, specific to that specific shopping or outlet center, which may
contain conditions that differ from the marketing practices we usually adopt. Many lease agreements provide for
a fixed initial term, and an option for us as lessee to extend such term. If an existing or future store is not
profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable
lease including, among other things, paying rent for the balance of the applicable lease term. As each of our
leases expires, if we do not have a renewal option, we may be unable to negotiate a renewal on commercially
acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. Any of the above could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The value of goodwill, brand names or other intangible assets reported in our financial statements may need_**
**_to be partially or fully impaired as a result of revaluations._**

As of December 31, 2020, our carrying amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, recorded on our
consolidated statements of financial position was €192.3 million. We will account for the Acquisition in
accordance with German GAAP. Due to any potential adjustments, future financial statements for the Group
could be materially different and may not be comparable to our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum, including but not limited to, risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible and tangible
assets, increased depreciation and amortization expenses over the remaining lives of the acquired assets and
recognition of temporary differences at the acquisition date. This could in turn have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. None of the financial information in this
offering memorandum has been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the consolidated statement of

financial position, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated
statement of cash flows that might occur as a result of the Transactions. See “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information—Historical Financial Information—Comparability of the Financial Statements.”_

**_Uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business._**

On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the
European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). On March 29, 2017, the UK government invoked Article 50
of the Lisbon Treaty to begin the process of formally leaving the European Union, and on January 31, 2020, the
United Kingdom withdrew its membership in the European Union and entered into a transition period which
expired on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the European Union and United Kingdom announced
that they had reached the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which was implemented on December 31,
2020 and entered into force provisionally on January 1, 2021. Despite the implementation of the EU—UK Trade
and Cooperation Agreement, there remains significant uncertainty as to how the agreement will affect relations
between the United Kingdom and the European Union. While the EU and the United Kingdom agreed a
comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade pursuant to the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement,
the end of the transition period on that date has, among other things, led to increased customs, health and safety
checks at the border, which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the United
Kingdom and may undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the
United Kingdom and the EU and cause political and economic instability in other countries of the EU.
Additionally, following the end of the transition period, the United Kingdom has ceased to be a member of the
EU single market, which has ended the free movement of services and workers between the United Kingdom and
the EU and may make it more difficult for our United Kingdom operations to do business with customers or
suppliers that are based in the EU. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom
generated 2.2% of our sales and we imported less than 1% of our raw materials from the United Kingdom. The
impact of the new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union and the resulting
effects on the political and economic future of the United Kingdom, remain uncertain. Economic instability and
uncertainty in Europe, has and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Climate change and related regulatory responses may adversely impact our business._**

There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased
concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in
weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changes in
weather patterns and an increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather conditions could, among
other things, disrupt the operation of our supply chain, increase our product costs and impact the types of
products that consumers purchase. For example, certain of our retail locations in Europe and the UAE could fall
below the flood line in the next twenty years. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term
adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In many of the countries in which we operate, governmental bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and
regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change. For example, in Germany, we are required to
undergo energy audits every four years. In addition, the German government has set broader long-term carbonreduction targets as well, and pursuant to such regulation, our business falls under the broad “industry” sector, a
category that will need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50.7% (from 1990 levels) by 2030. These laws
and regulations, which may be mandatory, have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a
result of required compliance by us, as well as by our suppliers, wholesale partners and distributors. In addition,
our manufacturing processes may be affected by new regulations in response to climate change. If we are
perceived to be a contributor of greenhouse gas emissions or global warming, or if we are perceived as not taking
appropriate steps to mitigate our effect on the environment, this could result in damage to our image and brand,
which is particularly focused on socially conscious individuals.

In addition, we have and may continue to take voluntary steps to mitigate our impact on climate change. As
a result, we may experience increases in energy, production, transportation and raw material costs, capital
expenditure or insurance premiums and deductibles.

Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_The Acquisition is subject to certain conditions and risks and, if it is not consummated, the Issuer will redeem_**
**_the Notes at 100% of the issue price, plus accrued and unpaid interest._**

On February 25/26, 2021, the Purchasers entered into the Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire, directly
or indirectly, from the Sellers the Target Business. The Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing
conditions, including, customary antitrust and regulatory approvals. If the Issue Date occurs more than three
business days prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial
Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the Offering into the Escrow Account on the Issue Date. The
release of the Escrowed Property is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that the funds
required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event within three
business days). As of the date of the offering memorandum, we do not yet know whether the Acquisition will
complete. If the Acquisition is expected to occur three business days prior to the Acquisition Closing Date,
pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the proceeds of the Notes will not be subject to any escrow
arrangements or security.

If the conditions precedent to the Acquisition are not satisfied or waived, as applicable, by the Escrow
Longstop Date, then the Acquisition will not be consummated. If the conditions to the release of the Escrowed
Property, as more fully described under “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption” have not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain_
other events, the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption as described in “Description of the
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and you may not obtain the return you expect to_
receive on the Notes.

In addition, your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or
financial position of the Target Business, or the terms of the Acquisition, between the Issue Date and the Escrow
Release Date, may have an impact on our creditworthiness, and you will not be able to rescind your decision to
invest in the Notes as a result thereof.

**_If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required_**
**_to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account may not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without_**
**_relying on funding from the Parent._**

The Escrowed Property will be limited initially to the gross proceeds of the Offering and will not be
sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, which is equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of
the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption.” In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory_
Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, the Parent will be required to fund the Issuer with an
amount sufficient to cover the difference between the Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of
the Escrowed Property, including accrued interest and additional amounts (if any) due with respect to the Notes
from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date and any negative interest which has accrued on
the Escrow Account.

Holders of the Notes will not have any direct right to enforce directly against the Parent, and must rely on
the Issuer’s right to enforcement. There can be no assurance that the relevant entities providing such commitment
will have sufficient funds to make this payment, and the Issuer may not have access to the funds necessary to
allow it to pay the full amount of the required redemption price in the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption.

**_The Issuer does not currently control the Birkenstock Transferred Entities and will not control the_**
**_Birkenstock Transferred Entities until the Acquisition Closing Date._**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuer does not, directly or indirectly, hold any issued and
outstanding common shares of the Birkenstock Transferred Entities. As a result, the Issuer’s ability to influence
the management of the Birkenstock Transferred Entities is limited. In particular:

   - The Sellers may not operate the business of the Birkenstock Transferred Entities until the Acquisition
Closing Date in the same way that the Issuer and the Sponsor would.

   - The Acquisition has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus from the
management of the Birkenstock Transferred Entities, which could adversely affect their ability to
operate the business of the Birkenstock Transferred Entities. Likewise, employees may be
uncomfortable with the Acquisition.

50


-----

   - In addition, the board of the entities in the Target Business is required to manage the business of the
entities in the Target Business under its own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interest of
the entities in the Target Business.

   - Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Birkenstock Transferred
Entities will fully comply with the covenants described in “Description of the Notes” to be included in
the Indenture. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date, the Birkenstock Transferred
Entities will not take any action that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those
covenants been applicable.

We cannot assure you that the Acquisition will be consummated given it is dependent on certain closing
conditions, including receipt of antitrust and regulatory approvals. If we are not able to satisfy or waive these
conditions, as applicable, the Acquisition Closing Date will not occur and the Acquisition will not be
consummated.

Any of the risks associated with the Issuer’s lack of control over the Birkenstock Transferred Entities until
the occurrence of the Acquisition Closing Date could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

**_The Sponsor’s opportunity to conduct due diligence with respect to the Target Business was limited, and their_**
**_due diligence may not have revealed all facts that may be relevant in connection with the Acquisition._**

Before making investments, the Sponsor conducts due diligence that it deems reasonable and appropriate
based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. The objective of the due diligence process is
to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances of an investment, to identify
possible risks associated with that investment and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an
acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. When conducting due diligence, the Sponsor
typically evaluates a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in
determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and
investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of
investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the
Sponsor relies on resources available to them, including information provided by the target of the investment
and, in some circumstances, third party investigations.

Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or
corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain
jurisdictions.

There may be liabilities that the Sponsor failed or was unable to discover in the course of performing due
diligence investigations into the Target Business in connection with the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition,
we may learn of additional information about the Target Business that adversely affect us, such as unknown or
contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or
in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.

We cannot be certain that the Sponsor’s due diligence investigation has revealed or highlighted all relevant
facts (including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary or
helpful in evaluating the merits of investing in the Target Business. We also cannot be certain that the Sponsor’s
due diligence investigations will result in the investment in the Target Business being successful or that the
actual financial performance of such investment will not fall short of the financial projections the Sponsor used
when evaluating that investment.

**_We may be unsuccessful in preventing a member of the Birkenstock family from using their surname as a_**
**_company name in the future._**

Our brand is named after the Birkenstock family that originally founded the business. Following the
Transactions, we will own and control the Birkenstock trademark as applied to goods and services, and to the
extent rights have inured to the Group. Under German trademark law, the members of the Birkenstock family are
permitted to use their family name within a company name, provided the respective family member takes
measures (i.e., such as adding their first name or other deviating features) to reduce the risk of confusion with
existing competing businesses who use “Birkenstock” in their company name. However, such measures might
not always prevent confusion. Although in the past German courts have imposed sanctions for abuses of

51


-----

prominent brand names through the licensing of family names, the entitlement to use one’s family name may
include allowing a third party to use the name “Birkenstock” as part of a company name, including potentially in
a competing business if not done in a misleading manner. While we have entered into an agreement with certain
members of the Birkenstock family through which they have consented to our use of the Birkenstock family
name in our corporate name for an indefinite period of time, if such agreement were to be terminated, challenged
or otherwise held invalid, or if, in the future, we had any material unresolved disputes with the Birkenstock
family, we may not be able to adequately protect our company name or may be prevented from using the
Birkenstock name for our legal entities. In addition, as of the date of this offering memorandum, at least one
member of the Birkenstock family uses the Birkenstock name in connection with an independent business. See
also “—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business is dependent on the image and reputation of the
_Birkenstock brand.” Any or all of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business,_
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Acquisition will entitle the Group’s customers and certain other business partners of the entities in the_**
**_Target Business to terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions and the transfer of_**
**_certain agreements to other acquisition entities._**

The Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the entities in
the Target Business. For example, the Issuer has identified change of control provisions in certain local facilities
and guarantee agreements. As a result of the Acquisition, these counterparties will be entitled to terminate their
agreements with us. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Given the structure of the Acquisition,
certain supplier and customer agreements as well as lease agreements must be transferred from the Sellers to new
legal entities of the Group. These counterparties must grant their consent to the transfer of any agreements. The
counterparties may, in their sole discretion, withhold their consent in which case the respective agreement would
remain with the respective Seller. The Sale and Purchase Agreement provides that to the extent that a third party
consent has not been obtained by the closing date, the parties shall put themselves economically in the same
position, as they would have been if the consent had been obtained.

**Risks Related to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes and the_**
**_Note Guarantees._**

Following the completion of the Transactions, we will be highly leveraged and have significant debt service
obligations. As of December 31, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had total
indebtedness in the amount of €1,506.6 million (equivalent), consisting of the Notes, drawings under the Senior
Term Facilities and certain existing real estate facilities. See “Capitalization,” “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” We anticipate that our high leverage will continue to exist for the_
foreseeable future.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important
consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

   - making it more difficult for the Issuer and its subsidiaries to satisfy their respective obligations with
respect to the Notes, the Senior Secured Facilities and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

   - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

   - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development, or other general corporate purposes;

   - restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

   - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

52


-----

   - increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating rate
of interest;

   - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures,
business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any
future borrowings; and

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional capacity for issuance of bid, advance payment, performance
and warranty guarantees for operative business purposes and increasing the cost of any future
guarantee issuances.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our obligations, including under the Notes and the Senior Secured Facilities.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on_**
**_cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to make payments on the Notes and the Note_**
**_Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no business operations other than management of the equity interests
it holds in its subsidiaries. Following consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will be dependent upon the
cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its
obligations, including its obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Given the Group’s international
operations, it has a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually
contribute to our Group’s results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend
on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare
dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The
Issuer’s subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make
distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including
the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of
these subsidiaries to move cash within the restricted group. In particular, the Senior Secured Facilities limit the
ability to upstream cash to the Issuer subject to certain exceptions. Applicable tax laws may also subject such
payments to further taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several
entities of the Group may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as
dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable
reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debt when due. The subsidiaries of the
Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes or
the Note Guarantees.

While the Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their
ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant
qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by agreements in existence on the
Issue Date and applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We will have the
ability to borrow up to approximately €200 million (equivalent) under our ABL Facility, which will be secured in
part by the Shared Collateral, and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and the Indenture will also permit the
incurrence of additional debt thereunder. The Indenture and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements will also
permit us to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to
incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not
secure the Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to
the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes, such debt is secured by liens that do not secure the
Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such debt, and other debt could be secured
or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and the Indenture will
contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of

53


-----

significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could
be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to the Issuer’s and its
subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Senior
Secured Facilities Agreements and the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not
constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfil our obligations under the
Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Following the consummation of the Transactions, we will be subject to restrictive covenants that will limit our_**
**_operating and financial flexibility._**

The Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and the Indenture will contain covenants which impose
significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements will limit our ability to, among other
things:

   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

   - make certain restricted payments and investments;

   - transfer or sell assets;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;

   - create or incur certain liens;

   - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

   - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

   - create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments
to us;

   - take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes;

   - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

   - pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we will be subject could limit our ability to finance our_
future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in
our interest.

In addition, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements will require us to comply with certain affirmative
covenants while amounts under the Senior Term Facilities remain outstanding. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Senior Term Facilities Agreement.” Our ABL Facility is expected to contain a_
springing financial covenant requiring compliance with a certain fixed charge coverage ratio (the “ABL
Springing Covenant”). See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—ABL Facility Agreement.” A
breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, including our
failure to comply with the ABL Springing Covenant (if tested) could result in an event of default under the
relevant Senior Secured Facilities Agreements. Upon the occurrence of a payment event of default that is
continuing under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, subject to the applicable cure period, and upon the
acceleration of indebtedness with respect to any other event of default by the creditors under our Senior Secured
Facilities Agreements, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Senior Secured Facilities and
elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Facilities, together with accrued interest,
immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Secured Facilities could lead to an event of
default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions,
including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities, accelerate
the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be
sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and
payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those
amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those
amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not_**
**_be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Senior
Secured Facilities and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations and future capital
expenditures, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is
subject to the success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative,
legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are
beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to
us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Facilities. At the
respective maturities of the Senior Secured Facilities, the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not
have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our
other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as
they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot
assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Notes and the Senior Secured Facilities, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to
pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us
to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial position and results
of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or
that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If
we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

**_Due to restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenses or forfeiture of interest carry forwards under_**
**_applicable law, we may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities._**

A certain amount of our annual financing expenses (primarily including interest payments) is not deductible
under existing interest limitation rules, especially the German interest barrier rules (Zinsschranke) as further
described below. Subject to certain requirements, the German interest barrier rules impose certain restrictions on
the deductibility of interest expense for German tax purposes. The German interest barrier rules generally
provide for a limitation on the deduction of net interest expenses in excess of 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA. For
purposes of the interest barrier rules, all entities that are part of the same fiscal unity (Organschaft) for corporate
income and trade tax purposes are treated as one single business. Any non-deductible amount exceeding the
threshold of 30% is carried forward and may be, again subject to the interest barrier rules, deductible in future
financial years. Any interest carryforward may be forfeited in part or in full in connection with certain measures,
such as a change of the ownership structure. Upon closing of the Acquisition, certain Group companies, in
particular in Germany, may forfeit their existing interest carryforwards on the Acquisition Closing Date.
Furthermore, on June 20, 2016, the Council of the European Union adopted the Directive (EU) 2016/1164
(ATAD I) laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal
market. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive contains five legally binding anti abuse measures, which member
states are generally required to apply against common forms of aggressive tax planning since January 1, 2019.
Part of the package of measures is the implementation of an interest limitation in line with German rules. The
restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax purposes may have adverse consequences for our
financial position and results of operations. The Council of the European Union has also adopted Directive (EU)

55


-----

2017/952 (ATAD II) targeting mismatches which needed to be implemented by December 31, 2019, but have not
been enacted in Germany to date. The German ministry of finance issued a new draft bill on the implementation
of the aforementioned directives on December 10, 2019, and published updates of such draft bill on March 24,
2020 and November 17, 2020. Amongst others, according to this draft bill, expenditures for intercompany
financing may be disallowed in the current and future tax periods. The draft bill intends to broaden the existing
rules on corresponding inclusions and deductions of income and expenses and introduces provisions to counter
tax shortfalls due to mismatches from the use of hybrid financial instruments or hybrid entities or due to dual tax
residency and, furthermore, introduces new arm’s length provisions on intercompany financing that may
ultimately limit the deduction of interest expenses on intercompany loans. If the draft bill is enacted and
depending on the final wording of the new legislation, the introduction of aforesaid rules could result in higher
taxable income and a higher tax burden for corporate income tax and trade tax purposes in the current and future
tax periods. Further measures may follow as part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project.

The interest limitation rules deriving from ATAD I have been implemented in Luxembourg. According to
the Luxembourg interest limitation rules, net borrowing costs incurred during a given fiscal year may only be
deductible up to the greater of (i) 30% of the taxpayer’s EBITDA and (ii) €3,000,000.

In addition, certain of our German subsidiaries have considerable tax loss carryforwards which have
partially been capitalized as deferred tax assets in our Financial Statements. The use of such existing tax loss
carryforwards and ongoing losses for German corporate income and trade tax purposes may be forfeited in case
of a direct or indirect transfer of shares, subject to certain limited exceptions. Such restriction, applying to both
corporate income and trade tax, depends on the percentage of share capital or voting rights transferred within a
five year period to one acquirer or person(s) closely related to the acquirer or a group of acquirers with a
common interest. Under current rules, if more than 50% of the share capital or voting rights are transferred to
such an acquirer, tax loss carryforwards and current losses will be forfeited to the extent no exception from the
general forfeiture rules can be applied, such as the built-in gains exemption pursuant to which tax loss
carryforwards survive to the extent taxable built-in gains are available at the level of the loss-carrying entity. To
the extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted, they cannot be set off against future tax profits which
would result in higher future tax burdens compared to the situation in which tax loss carryforwards can be used to
lower the actual tax burden on profits. Such restriction may require a write down of the deferred tax assets in our
consolidated financial statements and would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.

Furthermore, upon the creation of a fiscal unity for German corporate and trade tax purposes, any tax loss
carryforwards and interest carry forwards for German corporate income and trade tax purposes of a subsidiary,
which have been incurred before the creation of the fiscal unity, will be excluded from use for the duration of the
fiscal unity.

**_Some of our indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Facilities, will bear interest at floating rates that_**
**_could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Debt under the Senior Secured Facilities will bear interest at a variable rate based on the Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (EURIBOR), London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for US Dollar loans and Sterling Overnight
Index Average (SONIA) (in each case, subject to a zero floor if less than zero (or in the case of the USD TLB, a
0.50% floor if LIBOR is less than zero)) plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in
the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for
capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreements nor the Indenture contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our
floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these
rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.
Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to
terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense
would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of interbank lending rates, regulators
and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting
investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR
or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In
addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be

56


-----

“benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the
implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European
regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the
performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of
any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may
perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other
consequences which cannot be predicted. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other
benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law
enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which
could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt
linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Term Facilities whose interest rates are linked
to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may
result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact
on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. These reforms and other pressures
may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change
in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate
in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.

**_The interests of the Sponsor may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The Sponsor indirectly controls the Issuer. As a result, the Sponsor has and will continue to have, directly or
indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our
management and to approve other changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring
action by our shareholder. Our Sponsor’s interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as
noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For
example, the Sponsor could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. The Sponsor is in the business of
making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or
indirectly with us. The Sponsor may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business
and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, the Sponsor may hold
interests in our suppliers or our customers. The Sponsor and its affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares
which would result in changes to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other
transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might
involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_Your right to receive payment under the Note Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior ranking debt_**
**_of the Guarantors._**

The obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Note Guarantee are general senior obligations of
such Guarantors and will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of
all existing and future obligations in respect of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor. Such debt includes their
obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities. Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of
the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and rank senior to the
Note Guarantee.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor under the Indenture in respect of an insolvency
event, the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of
such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such Note Guarantee. Until the senior ranking debt
of such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Notes would be entitled but for the
subordination provisions included in the Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior
ranking debt of such Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a
Guarantor under the Indenture, holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than
the holders of the Notes, in respect of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Note Guarantees will
provide:

   - customary turnover provisions by the Trustee and the holders of the Notes for the benefit of the holders
of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor;

57


-----

   - that if a payment default on any senior ranking debt of a Guarantor has occurred and is continuing,
Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Note Guarantee until such default is cured or
waived;

   - that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior ranking indebtedness that
permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such default,
such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Notes, or pursuant to its Note Guarantee,
until (among others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after the date on
which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and

   - that the holders of the Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, from taking any enforcement action
in relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances.

The Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee will have
standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Moreover, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency
proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Guarantors under the Indenture and by accepting any Note
each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of
the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse under the Note Guarantees in the event of a default by the
Issuer or a Guarantor under the Indenture.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries, including the_**
**_claims of trade creditors, and effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not_**
**_secure the Notes._**

The Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the subsidiaries of the
Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes, including its obligations to trade creditors, and effectively subordinated to
all of the Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness that is secured by liens that do not secure the Notes, including
the Senior Secured Facilities, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such indebtedness. In
the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking
senior or equal in right of payment to the Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Notes on a pro rata
basis with debt ranking equal in right of payment to the Notes only after the senior secured debt has been repaid
in full from these assets. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the
Notes then outstanding. The Indenture will not prohibit us from incurring additional secured debt, nor will it
prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities.

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of
non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such
subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors
of the Issuer and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Issuer
becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a
solvent transaction:

   - the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

   - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the
assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as
applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including
depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer.
In addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur
substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the Indenture, and such
indebtedness may also be secured. The Indenture will not contain any limitation on the amount of other
liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could_**
**_reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Collateral providers to remain in possession of,
retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral to

58


-----

the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain
conditions, the Collateral providers may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security
Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of
indebtedness.

**_The Shared Collateral secures the Senior Secured Facilities on a senior priority basis, and your rights to_**
**_recover on such Shared Collateral will be limited._**

A portion of the Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will be pledged to the Security Agent for the benefit of the
lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities, as well as to the Security Agent for the benefit of holders of the
Notes. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Facilities are secured
by prior ranking security interests in the Shared Collateral (with the Senior Term Facilities having first priority)
and the proceeds of any sale of the Shared Collateral on enforcement will be applied first to repay all debt of the
lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities. Consequently, you may not be able to recover on such Shared
Collateral because the lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized
from any enforcement of such Shared Collateral.

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will be granted as security for_**
**_the Notes and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral described in this offering
memorandum. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” In addition, a portion of the Collateral, the Shared
Collateral, will also secure the Senior Term Facilities and the ABL Facility on a senior-priority basis and the
Notes on a junior-priority basis, and may secure additional debt ranking senior to or pari passu with the Notes
and the Note Guarantees. Although the pledge over the shares of the Issuer will secure the Notes and the Note
Guarantees thereof on a first-priority basis and will not secure the Senior Secured Facilities, such pledge may
secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt
secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the value of the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition, pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral will be applied in repayment of any
Super Senior Liabilities (to the extent the Designation Date has occurred), followed by (or unless the Designation
Date has not occurred) any lenders under the Senior Term Facilities, among others, before repayment of the
Notes and Note Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the
Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims
of the holders of all other existing and future senior debt ranking pari passu with the Notes and the Note
Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the
holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure the
Notes, and the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain types of debt
permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Notes and the Note
Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of
such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes
are accelerated, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt
and will rank equally with the holders of unsecured debt of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect
to any property or assets that is excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes_**
**_and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the
Collateral granted in favor of holders of the Notes and, in respect of the Shared Collateral, only after lenders
under the Senior Term Facilities have been paid in full. In the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect
of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the
Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes including due to the reasons described in the preceding sentence.
No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the
assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the
business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets
in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of
buyers.

59


-----

The Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only
limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other
parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or,
if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain
jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our
licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the
transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to
hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security
Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions,
governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents,
approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be
delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly
decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not
be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by the Collateral. With respect to any shares of our
subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited
value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that
have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be
satisfied, which may leave little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by
a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In
addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to
repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the
sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the
Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including
statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties
may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds
available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture,
holders of such Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby,
thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

**_Not all of the Guarantors will initially guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantors. Subject to and in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Post-Closing Guarantors are expected to become guarantors
of the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee supplemental indentures substantially in the forms
attached to the Indenture within 120 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, substantially
simultaneously with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Term Facilities. As of and for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, (i) all the members of the BIRKENSTOCK Group organized in the
United States and (ii) the material members of the BIRKENSTOCK Group incorporated in Germany, in each
case, which assets and shares (as applicable) are being transferred to the Purchasers pursuant to the Transactions,
represented 80.8% of the consolidated revenues of the BIRKENSTOCK Group, such entities’ unconsolidated
assets represented 80.9% of the sum of the unconsolidated assets of the BIRKENSTOCK Group and such
entities’ unconsolidated EBITDA represented 92.4% of the consolidated EBITDA of the BIRKENSTOCK
Group. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such additional Note Guarantees within
the time period specified. The Issue Date Note Guarantees by the Issue Date Guarantors and Post-Closing
Guarantees by the Post-Closing Guarantors will be limited as set forth in “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.”_

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Notes will be secured by the Shared Collateral which will also secure the obligations under the
Facilities. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional pari
_passu indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral. The Intercreditor_
Agreement will provide that the security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for the secured parties with
respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent may
refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group. For the purposes of
enforcement, “Instructing Group” means, in the context of our capital structure upon consummation of the

60


-----

Transactions, more than 50% by value of the total senior secured credit participations under the relevant Senior
Secured Facilities (as described further in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement”), certain hedge counter-parties at that time, any other additional pari passu indebtedness that may be_
secured on such collateral (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”). The Majority Senior Secured Creditors
may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it
would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

**_The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or_**
**_the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such_**
**_security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or
voidance periods for such Note Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared
security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in
particular, as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain
circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance
period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or
perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective
and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity
interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees thereof or the Collateral across_**
**_multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Luxembourg, the entities expected to provide Notes Guarantees
are organized under the laws of Luxembourg, Germany and the United States and the Collateral includes the
shares of the Issuer and Lux SPV, which are entities incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and certain
present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency,
administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under
the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws
of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in
such complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may
limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any
conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular
jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Note Guarantees and the
Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The Escrow Charge (if any) will be granted to the Trustee and the security interests in the remaining_**
**_Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent, in each case, rather than directly to the holders of the Notes._**
**_The ability of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by_**
**_local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the
Guarantors under the Note Guarantees thereof (including the Escrow Charge (if any)) will not be granted directly
to the holders of the Notes but to the respective Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, and thus the holders of
the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or
to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the relevant Trustee or
Security Agent, as applicable, including as may be provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note,

61


-----

you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will
have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral (excluding the
Escrow Charge) will be subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security
interests over such Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the
appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods
may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to
beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly
secured. In certain jurisdictions, including Luxembourg, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the
creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent
(“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or
in connection with the Indenture (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests
in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not
directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt
will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any
payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment
in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security
interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and
will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the relevant
Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant
Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these
jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct
are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes
will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_Security Interests.”_

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the
security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the
claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. The
creation of a valid security interest under a Luxembourg law governed pledge agreement in relation to certain
assets are subject to perfection requirements such as the registration of the pledge in the shareholder’s register of
the company whose shares are pledged for a pledge over shares and the entry into the pledge agreement by the
parties for a pledge over claims. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the
invalidity of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the
Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in
the same Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent will be under any obligation or responsibility to
take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the_**
**_Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including
a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of
the Indenture and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted
subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the
liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any Note Guarantees by such subsidiary will be released
under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce
the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such
unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries. See “Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees—Note Guarantees
_Releases” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the_**
**_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_**
**_limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent_**
**_conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On and after the Issue Date or within 120 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, as
applicable, our obligations under the relevant Notes will be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by
security interests over the relevant Collateral (the “Security Interests”). The Issuer is organized under the laws of
Luxembourg and the entities expected to provide Notes Guarantees are organized under the laws of Luxembourg,
Germany and the United States. With respect to the Issuer and any Guarantor organized under the laws of a
member state of the European Union, there is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as
defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (recast) is the
jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares
in the Issuer and Lux SPV, which are entities organized under the laws of Luxembourg, and security interests in
certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer.

The insolvency laws of other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the
Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or
the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Note
Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court
may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The
following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes
generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer
and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations
generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on
other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

   - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the
Security Interests provided by such security provider;

   - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or
any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the
Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

   - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to
be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we
cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the
liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited
to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and
security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to
what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the
possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability
may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other
_limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

63


-----

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would,
for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the
Guarantor or security provider:

   - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created
such security after its insolvency;

   - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business
person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such
Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security
Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for
insolvency had been made; or

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee
or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our
benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and
(i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation
of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was
about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were
unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to
make required payments as and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally
may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any
Security Interest if:

   - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

   - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due;

   - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or

   - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis.

Although we believe that both the Issuer and the Guarantors are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to
the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a
Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security
Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor
or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not
a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests
were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Note Guarantees
and Security Interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_**
**_the Collateral._**

Certain of the entities expected to provide a Note Guarantee are organized under the laws of Luxembourg,
Germany, and the United States. Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or any
Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or
similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting
the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable
thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or
security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note
Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden
of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such

64


-----

Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin
capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors or managers of such
subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

The Note Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft
_mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG) for_
the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such
shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to
constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity
maintenance rules. Therefore, any Note Guarantees provided by a GmbH will be subject to certain contractual
limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document under which any
Note Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Security Documents, respectively, designed to
ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory
laws.

Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138
BGB and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee
and/or security interest, among others, the third party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent
conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third party creditors of the
GmbH. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to a GmbH & Co. KG.

As a result, the Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be
materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to
it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is
possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other
insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest
the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of
the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be
limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the
Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security
provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral
may be subject to similar limitations.

See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, and are not required to be,
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered
or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These
restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to
ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable
securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable.

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or
Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein), will be issued in exchange for book entry interests only in very
limited circumstances. Owners of book entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The
common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will be the registered
holders of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or
in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make
payments to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to
participants’ accounts that hold book entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by

65


-----

such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will
have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book
entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise
any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if an investor owns a book entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures implemented for
the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if investors own book entry interests, they will
be restricted to acting through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures to be implemented
through Euroclear and/or Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the
Notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

   - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

   - your ability to sell your Notes; or

   - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the
Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the market
for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of
Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.

The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the
Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market making activities at any time
without notice. In addition, such market making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S.
Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading market
for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at
all.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors (together, the “Non-U.S. Obligors”) are organized or incorporated
outside the United States, and their business is substantially conducted outside the United States. A majority of
the directors, managers and executive officers of the Non-U.S. Obligors are non-residents of, and substantially all
of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the Non-U.S. Obligors will submit to the
jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be
unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors, managers and executive officers of
Non-U.S. Obligors. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of the Non-U.S. Obligors and their
subsidiaries and those of their directors, managers and executive officers are located outside of the United States,
you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent
decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Non-U.S. Obligors may not be subject to the civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce
(i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Non-U.S. Obligors and the directors, managers and
executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions
against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with Luxembourg and Germany.
For further information see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain_**
**_circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender_**
**_offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to
purchase all the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a situation, the
Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a
significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the
tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A
change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements
and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any
failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the
Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations
or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control
as defined in the Indenture.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in
such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer, purchases,
all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the
right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning_**
**_under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of_**
**_control has occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, the Issuer will
be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The definition of “change of control”
in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to any person. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly established meaning under relevant law,
varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may
be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes.

**_We may dispose of certain assets or capital stock of entities in the Group._**

We may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, or other transactions that, in our
judgment, would be beneficial to us, even if such transactions might involve risks to you as noteholders. For
example, pursuant to the provisions of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and the Indenture, we may,
under certain circumstances, sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of material assets of the Group and, if
meeting certain leverage ratios on a pro forma basis, distribute some or all of the proceeds therefrom to our
shareholders. Such a transaction would not constitute a change of control or a default under the terms of the
Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” Additionally,
we may issue, sell transfer or otherwise dispose of the capital stock of entities in the Group for purposes of taking
a dividend or distribution that would benefit us but not benefit you as a noteholders.

67


-----

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the
value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a credit
rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension,
reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the
value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes issued under
such Indenture receive any two of the following ratings: Baa3 or higher from Moody’s, BBB- or higher from
S&P or BBB- or higher from Fitch, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then
beginning that day and continuing until such time as such Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either
rating agency, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” At any time when_
these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash
dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with the
interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade
rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange. However, there can be no assurance that the Notes will become or remain listed on
the Official List of the Exchange. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to
dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the
Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange does not imply that a public offering of any of the Notes in the
Channel Islands or the Isle of Man has been authorized. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the
Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for
comparable issuers, failure to be approved for listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange or another
recognized listing exchange or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing
exchange may have an adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign currency exchange as a result of investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the Notes
will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of
the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no
control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes
below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a U.S. dollar basis.

**_The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended._**

The Indenture will not be required to, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
as amended (the “TIA”) and will not incorporate or include and will not be subject to any of the provisions of the
TIA. Consequently, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to
holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those respecting preferential collections
by the trustee or conflicting interests of the trustee. See “Description of the Notes.”

**_Rights under the Notes may be adversely affected by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”)_**
**_and the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) in Luxembourg._**

Under the terms of the Luxembourg law of 24 July 2015 (the “FATCA Law”) and the Luxembourg law of
18 December 2015 (the “CRS Law”), the Issuer is likely to be treated as a Luxembourg Reporting Financial

68


-----

Institution. As such, the Issuer may require all noteholders to provide documentary evidence of their tax
residence and all other information deemed necessary to comply with the above mentioned regulations. Should
the Issuer become subject to a withholding tax and/or penalties as a result of non-compliance under the FATCA
Law and/or penalties as a result of non-compliance under the CRS Law, the amount paid to the noteholders under
the Notes may be materially affected. Furthermore, the Issuer may also be required to withhold tax on certain
payments to the noteholders which would not be compliant with FATCA (i.e. the so-called foreign passthru
payments withholding tax obligation).

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Debt Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described under “Description of
_the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the_
Debt Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things the Issuer (and all related provisions)
will now refer to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company
of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the indenture governing the Notes.
Such a modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed
exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such
modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange
could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners
of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes the
New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount. In
such event, U.S. Holders (as defined under “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”) would be required to include that original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in_
advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection with the IPO
Debt Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting OID,
if any.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**_The Acquisition_**

On February 25/26, 2021, the Purchasers, consisting of entities indirectly controlled by the Sponsor, entered
into the Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire from the Sellers the Target Business. We currently expect the
Acquisition to complete by April 30, 2021. The consummation of the Acquisition is, however, subject to the
satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including customary antitrust and regulatory approvals. Under the
terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers have agreed to take all necessary steps to obtain the
required clearances following the signing of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. If closing has not occurred by
July 31, 2021 (the “Acquisition Longstop Date”), unless the Sellers and the Purchasers have agreed in writing to
postpone the Acquisition Longstop Date, the Sale and Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The purchase price for the Acquisition and estimated repayment of the amounts outstanding under the
Existing Credit Facility is approximately €3,700 million, as adjusted for certain notified cash leakage items and
certain other adjustments required under the Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Price”). In addition to
the Purchase Price, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the German Newco will grant to the Birkenstock GmbH &
Co. KG an earn-out note in an amount of €400 million, which shall become payable if certain conditions are met.
BK LC Lux Midco S.à r.l. (“MidCo”), the direct shareholder of the Parent shall ultimately assume all obligations
to pay the amount under the earn-out note from German Newco with full discharge.

An amount of the Purchase Price of €525 million (the “Deferred Purchase Price”) will not become due and
payable as of the Acquisition Closing Date and instead will be deferred by Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG and
distributed to certain of the Sellers (i) granted as an interest-bearing instrument issued by AB-Beteiligungs
GmbH as lender to German Newco and then transferred by German Newco via the intermediate companies and
ultimately to the Parent in the amount of €275 million (the “Shareholder’s Note”) and (ii) contributed by CB
Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG (“CBB”) into Midco (the “Shareholder Rollover”) in the amount of €250 million,
in each case, pursuant to the terms agreed between the Sellers and the Purchasers under the Sale and Purchase
Agreement and subject to the entry into definitive agreements expected to be entered on the Acquisition Closing
Date.

The Sale and Purchase Agreement contains customary warranties given by the Sellers as to capacity, title
and certain business matters as well as customary interim operating covenants given by the Sellers regarding,
among other things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of the BIRKENSTOCK Group pending closing of
the Acquisition. The Sellers’ liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations.

Furthermore, subject to certain customary exceptions, the Sellers have agreed that, for two years from the
Acquisition Closing Date, neither they nor their affiliates will engage in the territory in which the Target
Business is conducted as of the Acquisition Closing Date, directly or indirectly, in the field of activities in which
the Target Business is active, or which the Target Business has specifically planned to become active in, as of the
Acquisition Closing Date. In addition, certain members of the Birkenstock family have entered into an agreement
with the Purchasers under which they undertake to comply with the non-compete obligation pursuant to the Sale
and Purchase Agreement and grant the Purchasers the right to use the name “Birkenstock,” subject to the
Acquisition Closing Date having occurred. See “Risks Related to Our Business—If the Birkenstock family were to
_start a business in competition with us and they would be entitled to use the Birkenstock name, or if our use of_
_Birkenstock as part of our company name is blocked as a consequence of challenges raised by the Birkenstock_
_family, our business may be materially adversely affected.”_

The Issuer is indirectly acquiring the Target Business through its subsidiary, Lux SPV, which has acquired
German Newco, a shell company formed by the Sellers’ advisors for purposes of the Acquisition, from the
Sellers’ advisors. German Newco will, directly or indirectly, acquire the Birkenstock Transferred Entities. See
“Summary—The Transactions.” Substantially all of the BIRKENSTOCK Group’s operations and assets other
than the Excluded Business are included in the Acquisition Perimeter. Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the
Issuer will not have control over the board of directors of the Birkenstock Transferred Entities. Prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date, the board of directors of the Birkenstock Transferred Entities will be required to
manage the Group under its own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interests of the Group. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—The Issuer does not currently control the Birkenstock
_Transferred Entities and will not control the Birkenstock Transferred Entities until the Acquisition Closing_
_Date.”_

**_Sources and Uses for the Acquisition_**

The funding for the Acquisition, the repayment of the Existing Credit Facility and the payment of related
fees and expenses and other costs related to the Transactions consist of proceeds from the following sources:

   - (i) equity contributions from the Sponsors and other co-investors in the form of subscription to
ordinary equity shares equaling approximately €1,780 million and contributed to German Newco
through intermediate holding companies (the “Equity Contribution”) and (ii) the deferred consideration
in the form of the Shareholder’s Note and the Shareholder Rollover; and

   - (i) drawings under the Senior Term Facilities in an aggregate amount of €1,075 million (equivalent)
and (ii) the proceeds from the offering of the Notes offered hereby.

The notional sources and uses necessary to consummate the Acquisition are shown in the table below.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the actual Acquisition
Closing Date, the actual purchase price for the Acquisition, the actual amounts outstanding under the Existing
Credit Facility on the Acquisition Closing Date (including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other
prepayment premiums), any fluctuations in currency exchange rates for amounts not denominated in euro, the
amount of the Equity Contribution or other available sources of cash and differences between estimated and
actual fees and expenses. In particular, the purchase price under the Sale and Purchase Agreement is subject to
certain notified cash leakage items and certain other adjustments required under the Sale and Purchase
Agreement.

The table below should be read in conjunction with “Description of the Notes” and “Capitalization.”

TLB Facility in an amount of the USD equivalent of €750 million.

(2) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby and does not reflect any issue discount.

the Issuer in the form of equity and/or subordinated shareholder funding. See “The Transactions.”

the cash proceeds of which will be contributed to the Issuer in the form of equity and/or subordinated shareholder funding. See “The

(5) Represents the expected equity contributions from the Sponsor and other co-investors in the form of subscription to ordinary equity
shares and/or subordinated shareholder funding.

(6) Represents the agreed consideration payable to the Sellers pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement, as adjusted for our estimates of
certain notified cash leakage items and certain other adjustments required under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, and the estimated
amount to prepay in full all outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility. The Purchase Price will be paid in cash at
closing, other than the Deferred Purchase Price which will be deferred pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder’s Note and the terms of
the rollover contributed by one of the Sellers to Midco. The Existing Credit Facility and any interest swaps related thereto will be
terminated effective as of the Acquisition Closing Date. See “The Transactions.”

(7) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including underwriting, financial advisory, legal, accounting,
ratings advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees (but excluding net interest expense that will accrue on proceeds of the
Notes to the extent that they are deposited into escrow).

**_Escrow Account_**

If the Issue Date is expected to occur more than three business days prior to the Acquisition Closing Date,
pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the

71


-----

Offering of the Notes into the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer. To the extent the proceeds of the
Offering are deposited into the Escrow Account, the Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and
will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. See
“Summary—The Offering—Collateral.” If and to the extent the Issue Date is expected to occur within three
business days prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer shall not be required to deposit cash equal to the
gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account.

The release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly
(and in any event within three business days). See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption.” If these conditions are not satisfied on or before the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the_
occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special
mandatory redemption price for the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory
redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property_
_are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account may not have sufficient_
_funds to cover such redemption without relying on funding from the Parent.”_

In the event of a special mandatory redemption, the Parent will be required to fund the Issuer in such
aggregate amounts as are required in order to enable the Issuer to pay any funding shortfall, including Escrow
Account fees, negative interest on the Escrow Account’s balances, costs and accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such special mandatory redemption date. See
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not_
_satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account may not have sufficient funds_
_to cover such redemption without relying on funding from the Parent.”_

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be €430 million. The proceeds from the Offering
of the Notes, together with borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities, the proceeds from the Shareholder’s
Note, the Shareholder Rollover and the Equity Contribution will be used (i) to fund the consideration payable for
the Acquisition, (ii) to repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facility, (iii) for cash overfunding
and (iv) to pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions

The notional sources and uses necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the table below.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the actual Acquisition
Closing Date, the actual purchase price for the Acquisition, the actual amounts outstanding under the Existing
Credit Facility on the Acquisition Closing Date (including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other
prepayment premiums), any fluctuations in currency exchange rates for amounts not denominated in euro, the
amount of the Equity Contribution or other available sources of cash and differences between estimated and
actual fees and expenses. In particular, the purchase price under the Sale and Purchase Agreement is subject to
certain notified cash leakage items and certain other adjustments required under the Sale and Purchase
Agreement.

**Overview**

We are an iconic brand globally renowned for crafting high quality, durable footwear that enriches the
health and wellbeing of our customers’ lives. With a proud heritage that dates back to our founding in 1774 in
Langen-Bernheim, Germany, BIRKENSTOCK has evolved into one of the foremost footwear brands in the
world, selling approximately 23 million units in nearly 100 countries worldwide and generating €753.8 million of
revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of €213.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.

We are best known as the inventors of the contoured footbed which, rooted in orthopedic theory, encourages
proper foot wellbeing, reduces pressure points, and re-emphasizes natural walking. Today, we use this legendary

75


-----

footbed across all our footwear styles, several of which have developed significant global recognition and
acclaim of their own. While we have a deep and diversified assortment comprised of hundreds of styles, our five
“core classics”—the Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the Madrid and the Boston—generated nearly 75% of our
annual revenues for FY 2020 and continue to enjoy significant global consumer demand today. In fact, the
BIRKENSTOCK Arizona was the number one searched shoe in the world in Q2 2020, while our shearling-lined
Boston clogs ranked as the number two most-searched women’s shoe in Q4 2020, according to public industry
sources.

We believe that how things are made matters as much as the product itself; we make our products with deep
respect for German and European standards for ethical, social, and environmental responsibility. To that end, we
maintain strict controls over our entire supply chain—from carefully selecting high quality, sustainable materials
from our largely European supply base to hand-finishing our products in our five owned manufacturing facilities
across Germany—and a relentless focus on creating well-made, functional, and durable products. As a
consequence of our focus on quality craftsmanship, we proudly employ 3,137 skilled laborers across Germany
and represent the largest employer in the German footwear industry.

Our unwavering commitment to creating functional products with integrity throughout our nearly 250-year
history has enabled us to build an unparalleled brand reputation. Today, the BIRKENSTOCK brand has become
synonymous with the highest standards of quality, durability, and craftsmanship, enabling us to engender
best-in-class levels of consumer loyalty and trust. As one of the original inclusive brands, we are proud of the
fact that our brand and products are worn and loved by consumers around the world, regardless of age, gender,
income, and race.

The breadth of our brand and the loyalty of our global fan base have enabled us to operate from the peculiar
but privileged position where demand for our products has historically exceeded supply. This dynamic has
allowed us to create scarcity in the market and control our brand while simultaneously driving highly predictable
and consistent growth—even through the COVID-19 pandemic—as demonstrated by the compound annual
growth rate of our revenues of approximately 10% from FY 2017 (giving effect to the Birkenstock USA
Reorganization) to FY 2020. This growth has been broad-based across most channels and geographies—though
we have seen meaningful recent acceleration in our owned direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels, which have
rapidly expanded from approximately 18% of revenues in FY 2018 to approximately 32% of revenues in the
twelve months ended December 31, 2020. We believe that DTC channels—in particular, our owned e-commerce
channel—will continue to generate an increasing portion of our revenues and profits going forward.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

We believe that the factors discussed below have significantly affected our results of operations, financial
condition and cash flow in the historical periods for which financial information is presented in this offering
memorandum, and that these factors will continue to have a material influence on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flow in the future.

**_Strength of the BIRKENSTOCK brand_**

The broader global footwear market is highly fragmented, with the top five players accounting for less than
25% of market share according to Euromonitor and except for the sports shoe sector, is largely comprised of
no-name products and own labels. Branded shoes constitute a smaller proportion of the global market in which
competition is primarily based on brand awareness, product functionality, quality and durability, design and
comfort, marketing and distribution. Our longstanding commitment to creating products of the highest quality
has enabled us to establish a strong brand reputation and enables us to be a dominant player in the sandal
category. We face more competition in the closed-toe shoe category, but we differentiate our products through
functional features, our signature footbed, our distinctive designs, and our brand.

The strength of our brand has resulted in a highly engaged and loyal fan base, allowing us to enjoy high
customer retention rates. BIRKENSTOCK is the number one most trusted brand according to a third party
footwear survey among recent casual footwear purchasers and it also ranked number one in a variety of key
attributes indicative of durability and craftsmanship. In addition, approximately 69% of surveyed customers
indicated they own more than one pair of BIRKENSTOCKs in a third-party survey and approximately 90% of
recent surveyed BIRKENSTOCK purchasers indicated a desire to repurchase our products. In addition, the
distinctive and instantly recognizable aesthetic of our products has enabled us to create categories of our own, a

76


-----

phenomenon that has resulted in a significant competitive advantage. Approximately 51% of recently surveyed
BIRKENSTOCK purchasers over the last two years did not consider purchasing any other brand. Our growth
during the periods under review reflects our increasing brand reputation and customer demand that has been
converted into sales and that we expect to continue to drive growth.

**_Expansion of direct-to-consumer channels_**

Our revenues are impacted by the proportion of our sales made through our wholesale channel and our
direct-to-consumer channels. Our largest distribution channel is wholesale, which comprises our direct business
with retail partners and our relationships with distribution partners in certain markets, playing an important role
in providing physical distribution and increasing our brand awareness globally. However, we have seen
meaningful recent acceleration in our DTC owned e-commerce and retail channels, which have rapidly expanded
from 15.5% of revenues in FY 2017 to 29.6% of revenues in FY 2020. The DTC acceleration has been driven
primarily by our e-commerce channel, which has grown at a 47% compounded annual growth rate between FY
2018 and FY 2020. Our average selling prices are higher for our products sold through DTC channels, with the
highest being achieved by sales through our e-commerce channel. As a result, our direct-to-consumer distribution
strategy drives a natural average selling price uplift as we retain a larger portion of the margins than when we sell
through our wholesale partners. Our revenues grew period-on-period from €648.3 million in FY 2018 to
€730.5 million in FY 2020, primarily due to the expansion of our e-commerce sales channel. In FY 2020, even
though the number of units sold decreased, our revenues increased primarily due to the growth in e-commerce
sales, which grew by approximately 80% as compared to FY 2019 and offset decreases in revenues in our
wholesale and retail channels that resulted from the closures of retail stores caused by lockdown measures
implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pace of our DTC channel expansion also drives variation in average selling prices across our regional
hubs with the Americas being the highest, largely due to the growth of our e-commerce channel in the United
States, while ASPA and MEAI have lower average selling prices due to the larger proportion of wholesale sales
and higher sales of EVA products due to the climates of the countries located in these regions. As we continue to
apply our direct-to-consumer strategy and takeover distribution in Europe and Asia, we expect that DTC—in
particular, our owned e-commerce channel—will generate an increasing portion of our revenues and profits
going forward. For FY 2020, revenues from our DTC channel represented 34%, 31%, 10% and less than 1% of
our revenues in Americas, Europe, ASPA and MEAI, respectively.

**_Sales volume, product mix and pricing_**

We generate our revenues through sales of our high quality, durable footwear that we produce in our five
owned manufacturing facilities across central Germany with supplies from our largely European supply base.
While we have a deep and diversified assortment comprised of hundreds of styles, our five core classics—the
Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the Madrid and the Boston—generated the vast majority of our revenues,
contributing nearly 75% of in FY 2020. We sold approximately 23.5 million units in FY 2018, 25.1 million units
in FY 2019, 23.0 million units in FY 2020 and 23.0 million units in the twelve months ended December 31,
2020, and approximately 3.6 million units and 3.6 million units in the three months ended December 31, 2020
and 2019, respectively. In the periods under review, sales volumes were driven by increased sales in our
e-commerce channel. While volumes decreased in FY 2020 as compared to FY 2019 due to lower sales to
wholesale and decreased retail sales as a result of retail store closures related to the lockdown measures imposed
by various governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales have recovered in the three months ended
December 31, 2020 and increased compared to the prior year period.

Our product mix also impacts our revenues as we offer products across the pricing spectrum, ranging from
€40 for our EVA products up to €400 for products from our premium 1774 collection. Most of our core classics
sell in the €75-100 range, which we believe to be a democratic and achievable price point for much of the general
population. Demand for our products has historically exceeded supply, which has supported our average selling
prices and enabled us to create scarcity in the market, control our brand image and limit any discounting activity.
We further drive average selling prices by increasing the mix of our premium products, such silhouettes made
with premium materials and our exquisite models. Our growing closed-toe shoe assortment also has a positive
impact on product mix given higher average selling prices and broader applicability across different seasons and
usage occasions. For example, revenues from sales of the Boston silhouette, a clog originally introduced in 1978,
have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 13% between FY 2016 and FY 2020, as we expanded the
style count and more prominently showcased the Boston in our e-commerce and retail channels.

**_The COVID-19 Pandemic_**

The COVID-19 outbreak significantly impacted our operational and financial performance for FY 2020 and
the three months ended December 31, 2020. In particular, following the outbreak of COVID-19, we recorded a
decrease in sales volumes and related revenues in our wholesale and retail channels, due in large part to
temporary closures of our owned retail stores and the stores of our wholesale partners in response to lockdown
orders imposed by local, regional and national governments. Store closures during the months of April and May
and November and December in 2020 had approximately a €2.7 million impact on our net income. However, this
decrease was offset by the growth in our e-commerce channel, resulting in an overall increase of our revenues in
FY 2020 as compared to FY 2019. The increase in revenues was further driven by additional sales in the fourth
quarter of FY 2020 from re-orders in the wholesale channel and the re-opening of retail stores in Europe between
May and September when the lockdown measures were lifted. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our ongoing
shift to DTC sales through the expansion of our e-commerce channel, which has also had the effect of increasing
our cash balances due to the increased amount of directly paid orders. EBIT and EBIT margin also increased as a
result of the growth in our e-commerce channel and certain cost savings measures in FY 2020. We also received
short-time working compensation (KUG) from the German government’s employment agency in the amount of
€6.1 million for FY 2020. We introduced a number of early and comprehensive measures in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic to safeguard our liquidity, including temporary cost controls related to travel and
entertainment, curtailment of consulting spend, and changes in shipment to wholesalers on normal credit terms

We initiated a shutdown of production at four of our production sites, Görlitz, Strödt, Bernstadt and SteinauÜrzell beginning in April 2020. While production resumed at three of our sites in late May or early June of 2020,
the downtime at the Steinau-Ürzell site continued until September 2020. The production shutdown resulted in
unplanned idle costs of €16.7 million (excluding idle costs assumed in budget or outside the shutdown period)
related to personnel expenses, depreciation and other fixed costs related to the production facilities. In the three
months ended December 31, 2020, we significantly ramped up production to replenish depleted inventory levels.
The average cost per unit increased significantly in the period that our production sites were closed compared to
normal levels. We incurred additional costs associated with stocking raw materials in March 2020 in anticipation
of delays and supply chain disruptions. In connection with the temporary shutdowns, we let go of our temporary
workforce, but were unable to re-hire much of the same talent upon re-opening. As a result, we incurred one-time
training costs of €3.2 million for FY 2020 in respect of temporary workers hired on reopening. We also incurred
other costs of €0.4 million primarily related to the deep-cleaning and disinfection of production sites and offices
and purchasing face masks for our employees.

Month-on-Month Net Sales Growth Comparison vs Last Year

_Source: Company information_
_Note: Company financials reported using German GAAP._

As a result of the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, the
comparability of our results for FY 2020 and the three months ended December 31, 2020 with the relevant
corresponding periods in 2019 and the comparability with future periods may be limited. See “Summary—Recent
_Developments—COVID-19 Update” for additional information on the measures we implemented and our_
financial performance following the outbreak of the COVID-19.

**_Costs of materials and other expenses_**

Our costs of materials primarily relate to raw materials, supplies and purchased merchandise as well as to
expenditure for purchased services, such as temporary personnel services. Our cost of raw materials,
consumables, supplies and purchased merchandise comprised 88.2% of our costs of materials for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020. Our primary raw materials, which relate to the components used for
manufacturing uppers and footbeds, include upper and cover leather, synthetic materials (such as Birko-Flor[®],
felt and textiles), buckles, cork, rubber, jute, soling sheets for the production of outsoles, EVA and polyurethane.
Our other supplies and auxiliary materials mainly comprise stamps, soft foam bedding and shanks for the
production of footbeds, and adhesives, rivets, and packaging materials, such as paper shoeboxes, tissue paper and
labels. Volatility, price increases and the availability of raw materials, particularly leather, jute and cork, impact
our margins and affect our financial results. We manage volatility and price increases through our long-term
relationships with suppliers and by entering into longer-term supply contracts. In addition, our breadth of
suppliers allows us greater control of our cost base as demonstrated by the reduction in our Material Unit Costs
from €7.7 in FY 2018 to €6.5 in FY 2020, representing a decrease of 16%.

We also incur personnel expenses, including wages, salaries and social security contributions and other
operating expenses for freight and logistics, marketing, legal and consulting fees and maintenance and repair of

79

machinery and buildings, rentals and leasing. Wages and salaries make up the largest portion of our personnel
expenses, being 86.3% of such expenses for the twelve months ended December 30, 2020. Freight and logistics
make up the largest portion of our other operating expenses, being 29.2% of such expenses for FY 2020.

Raw materials costs for our key raw materials increased in FY 2019 as we used a greater amount of
premium materials but remained stable between FY 2019 and FY 2020. We also began using an SAP-based
purchasing function in FY 2018 that allows us to place orders more systematically, resulting in more precise
allocation of purchases to material categories, thus enabling us to react to and partially mitigate any adverse
effects resulting from increases in costs. Personnel costs increased from FY 2018 to FY 2019 due to employees
hired in the Americas and retail store openings in Europe to support future business growth, but largely remained
stable from FY 2019 to FY 2020 and in the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. As a percentage of
revenue, our cost of materials and personnel costs decreased during the periods under review primarily as a result
of the increase in sales in the higher margin DTC channels, which has resulted in higher margins in the business
overall. In FY 2020, we experienced a sharp decrease in costs of materials as a percentage of revenues due to the
strong growth in sales through our e-commerce, particularly in the United States, and – to a lesser extent – the
reduction in temporary workers while our production facilities were shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Other operating expenses increased during each of the periods under review due in large part to our DTC
strategy. The increased sales in our e-commerce sales channel resulted in higher freight and logistics expenses
due to more expensive single pick shipments. The opening of retails stores in FY 2020 also increased our
expenses.

We consider approximately half of our costs to be fixed costs and half of our costs to be variable costs. Of
our fixed costs, approximately half are semi-variable as we can reduce them in the short-term as demonstrated by
our cost savings measures undertaken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic where we were able to reduce
expenses related to temporary workers in the short-term to control costs while our production facilities were
temporarily closed.

**_Seasonality_**

We experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a majority of our products are sandals. The seasonal
nature of our business is broadly similar across geographies and sales channels with wholesale seeing an increase
in sales slightly earlier in the spring months, while sales in the direct-to-consumer channels increase in the
summer. Between October and March, we manufacture sandals and shoes for the wholesale channel, and during
the first few months of the calendar year we rely on our built-up stock for our sales to wholesale
partners. Starting in March and during the warmer months of the year, demand for our products from the
direct-to-consumer channels increases. In FY 2020, 54.9% of our sales occurred in the second half of the
financial year (March to September). We also incur significant additional expenses in advance of and during this
period in anticipation of higher sales during that period, including the cost of additional inventory, which is
stored on palettes in our warehouses until shipped, fixed cost such as rent and leases for retail shops and outlets
as well as depreciation and amortization of production plants that were temporarily closed during FY 2020. We
have focused on balancing our seasonality through our strategic focus on entering and expanding certain product
categories, including closed-toe shoes, professional/orthopedic, kids, and adventure. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Business—Our business is affected by seasonality and weather conditions, which could result in_
_fluctuations in our operating results.”_

**_Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations_**

We operate and sell products globally, and, as a result, we generate a portion of our sales and incur a portion
of our expenses in currencies other than our functional currency, euro, which are primarily U.S. dollars, Japanese
yen, British pounds and Canadian dollars. As a result of our significant presence in the United States, we are
particularly exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar, and following the Transactions, a
large portion of our indebtedness will be denominated in U.S. dollars. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020, approximately 52% of our revenues were in currencies other than euro, primarily in U.S.
dollar. We are also exposed to currency exchange risks as a result of an increasing amount of invoicing being
done in local currency, particularly by our subsidiaries in the United States. We aim to manage our currency
exposure through our hedging strategy. Management annually evaluates the budget rates for the following
business year and the further hedging strategy against the background of the respective market outlook to
determine the overall activities for the next business year. We adjust the hedging strategy from time to time
during the course of the year as may be needed. In the past three years the hedging arrangements for euro to U.S.
dollar covered approximately between 50% to 70% of the expected U.S. dollar exposure. See also note VI in the
2020 Financial Statements.

80


-----

We are also subject to currency translation exposure because the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of
many of our operating subsidiaries are reported in such subsidiary’s functional currency and are then translated
into euro, our reporting currency, at closing exchange rates for the period for asset and liabilities and at the
average rates for profits and losses. Fluctuations in exchange rates against the euro will give rise to differences
and as many of our subsidiaries report in currencies other than the euro, these fluctuations may be significant. A
weakening euro will result in translation profits and, conversely, a strengthening euro will result in translation
losses.

During the periods under review, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate result in net foreign
exchange losses in FY 2018 and in FY 2020 but net foreign exchange gains in FY 2019.

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements**

**_Consolidation of the Birkenstock USA entities_**

Following the merger of the limited partnership shares of Footwear Distribution GmbH & Co. KG into, and
the acquisition of shares in Footwear Beteiligungs GmbH by, Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG, we consolidated the
balance sheets of the Birkenstock USA entities into our balance sheet as of September 30, 2017 and the income
statements of the Birkenstock USA entities were consolidated into our income statement for the first time in FY
2018. As a result, the financial information for FY 2018 and subsequent periods is not fully comparable to our
financial information for any prior period.

**_Impact of the Transactions_**

On February 25/26, 2021, a subsidiary of the Issuer entered into the Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire
the Target Business comprising the Acquisition Perimeter. See “Summary—The Transactions.” The Acquisition
Perimeter includes substantially all of the BIRKENSTOCK Group’s operations and assets other than the
Excluded Business. Consequently, our consolidated financial information following the Transactions will not be
fully comparable with our historical consolidated financial information due to, among other things, (i) changes to
goodwill that may result from the Acquisition, (ii) additional interest expense associated with the financing of the
Transactions (including the refinancing of certain of our existing debt), and (iii) changes to the level of
consolidation of our results in the future. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Historical
_Financial Information—Comparability of the Financial Statements.”_

**Key Line Items in Our Income Statements**

consolidation.

**_Revenues_**

Revenues primarily includes revenues generated from the sale of products and services rendered, from
contracts with customers, primarily related to the sale of shoes.

**_Changes in finished goods and work in progress_**

Changes in finished goods and work in progress present the difference of the related balance sheet line items
from the start of the reporting period compared to the end of such reporting period.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income includes, in particular, income relating to other periods from the reversal of
provisions made and income from currency translation differences.

_Revenues_

Our revenues increased by €23.4 million, or 22.5%, from €104.0 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2019 to €127.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily
driven by the strong performance of online sales in all of our regional hubs, which resulted in revenue generated
through our e-commerce channel increasing from €21.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2019 to
€46.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020.

_Change in finished goods and work in progress_

Change in finished goods and work in progress amounted to €44.0 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2019 compared to €36.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020. The lower amount

82


-----

of inventories was primarily due to lower inventories following the reduction to meet consumer demand in FY
2020 and in line with our strategy to reduce the amount of inventories kept on stock.

_Other operating income_

Our other operating income increased by €1.6 million, or 48.3%, from €3.4 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2019, to €5.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was
primarily driven by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar exchange rate.

_Cost of materials_

Our cost of materials increased by €12.5 million, or 28.7%, from €43.4 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2019 to €55.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily
driven by cost of purchased services, including the hiring of additional temporary workers due to an increase in
production volumes.

_Personnel expenses_

Our personnel expenses remained unchanged, from €42.2 million in the three months ended December 31,
2019, to €42.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020, due to the unchanged and stable workforce
level.

_Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation on tangible assets_

Our amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of tangible assets decreased by €0.1 million, or 1.8%,
from €7.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2019, to €6.9 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by end of the useful life of certain depreciated assets.

_Other operating expenses_

Our other operating expenses increased by €8.0 million, or 18.0%, from €44.7 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2019, to €52.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was
primarily driven by increases in logistics and advertising expenses.

_Net profit_

Our net profit increased by €6.5 million, or 84.2%, from €7.7 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2019, to €14.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily
driven by the factors discussed above.

_Revenues_

Our revenues increased by €9.0 million, or 1.2% from €721.5 million in FY 2019 to €730.5 million in
FY 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher average sales prices achieved through increased
e-commerce sales, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and directly selling to consumers in markets which
had previously been served by distributors. The changes in the proportion of DTC sales had a positive impact on
our revenues during FY 2020 as a whole, but was offset by the negative development in overall sales volumes
which decreased from 25.1 million units in FY 2019 to 23.0 million units in FY 2020 as a result of a reduction in
retail sales due to the national lock-downs imposed in March, April and May 2020 in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. After the reopening of retail stores from mid-May, we experienced a noticeable recovery in retail
sales, initially driven by catch-up effects, which continued until the end of FY 2020 due to sustained strong
customer demand.

_Change in finished goods and work in progress_

The change in finished goods and work in progress amounted to €26.7 million in FY 2019 as compared to
€(32.5) million in FY 2020. The decrease was primarily due to reduction in finished goods inventory to meet
customer demand following the production shutdown in April 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Other operating income_

Our other operating income decreased by €1.5 million, or 6.3%, from €24.3 million in FY 2019 to
€22.8 million in FY 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in income from currency translation
differences, attributable to the fluctuation in the USD/EUR exchange rate.

-----

_Cost of materials_

Our cost of materials decreased by €53.1 million, or 26.3%, from €202.2 million in FY 2019 to
€149.1 million in FY 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the nearly two-month temporary shutdown of
our production facilities in the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the lower number of pairs
produced and the reduction of inventories. In addition, the reduction in temporary personnel services in FY 2020
also reduced costs of purchased services. Cost of materials as a percentage of revenues decreased to 20.4% in
FY 2020 as compared to 28.0% in FY 2019, primarily as a result of the increase in sales in the higher margin
DTC channels (particularly e-commerce), which has resulted in higher margins.

_Personnel expenses_

Our personnel expenses decreased by €1.0 million, or 0.6%, from €172.1 million in FY 2019 to
€171.2 million in FY 2020. Personnel expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly to 23.4% in the
FY ended 2020 as compared to 23.9% in FY 2019. This slight decrease is primarily due to short-term work
during the production down-time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was slightly offset by an increase
in wages and salaries.

_Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation on tangible assets_

Our amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of tangible assets increased by €2.6 million, or 9.5%,
from €27.2 million in FY 2019 to €29.8 million in FY 2020. The increase was primarily driven by additions in
concessions, patents, licenses and similar rights and their amortization over the period. Amortization in both
periods include an amortization of the BIRKENSTOCK brand name in an amount of €6.1 million.

_Other operating expenses_

Our other operating expenses increased by €16.9 million, or 8.1%, from €210.2 million in FY 2019 to
€227.1 million in FY 2020. Other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 31.1% in FY 2020
as compared to 29.1% in FY 2019. The increase was primarily driven an increase in freight and logistics costs by
€17.0 million and marketing expenses by €5.2 million in FY 2020 as compared to FY 2019 due to the increased
share of e-commerce sales with more expensive single pick shipments and higher rent expenses as the result of
the opening of new retail stores, partially offset by lower legal and consulting fees.

_Net profit_

Our net profit decreased by €31.5 million, or 22.2%, from €142.0 million in FY 2019 to €110.5 million in
FY 2020. The decrease was due to the decrease in inventories, the temporary closure of production facilities and
retail stores, particularly in the third quarter of FY 2020, and unavoidable fixed costs in production, partially
offset by the increased e-commerce sales and measures aimed at reducing costs during the COVID-19 pandemic,
including short-time working compensation from the German federal employment agency (KUG).

_Revenues_

Our revenues increased by €73.2 million, or 11.3% from €648.3 million in FY 2018 to €721.5 million in
FY 2019. The increase was primarily driven by our increasing brand recognition and customer demand converted
into sales through the launch of additional e-commerce stores, the strong performance of e-commerce globally,
as well as strong growth in our wholesale and retail channels.

_Change in finished goods and work in progress_

The change in finished goods and work in progress amounted to €4.8 million in FY 2018 as compared to
€26.7 million in FY 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased production resulting in availability of
goods as well as improved delivery performance due to the availability of full assortments.

_Other operating income_

Our other operating income increased by €14.1 million, or 138.5%, from €10.2 million in FY 2018 to
€24.3 million in FY 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in income from currency translation
differences, attributable to the fluctuation in the USD/EUR exchange rate as the U.S. dollar appreciated towards
the euro.

_Cost of materials_

Our cost of materials increased by €21.6 million, or 11.9%, from €180.7 million in FY 2018 to
€202.2 million in FY 2019. Cost of materials as a percentage of revenues increased to 28.0% in FY 2019 as

86


-----

compared to 27.8% in FY 2018. The increase was primarily driven by price increases for key materials (such as
stamps, cork, EVA granulate, footbeds and shanks) and a higher portion of premium materials used in show
production. This increase was partially offset by the decrease in cost of purchased services primarily due to a
shift in the use of external personnel to our own personnel.

_Personnel expenses_

Our personnel expenses increased by €31.3 million, or 22.3%, from €140.8 million in FY 2018 to
€172.1 million in FY 2019. Personnel expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 23.9% in FY 2019 as
compared to 21.7% in FY 2018. The increase was primarily driven by investments in future business growth
through the build-up of personnel in the United States and Canada, retail store openings in Europe, hiring
additional temporary production and warehouse employees to cover higher production and peak volumes in
warehouses and the insourcing of external services, which shifts the amount from a cost of materials to a
personnel expense.

_Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation on tangible assets_

Our amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of tangible assets decreased by €2.8 million, or 9.3%,
from €30.0 million in FY 2018 to €27.2 million in FY 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by disposals in
machinery and technical equipment, prepayments of intangible assets, land and buildings and factory and office
equipment. Amortization in both periods include an amortization of the BIRKENSTOCK brand name in an
amount of €6.1 million.

_Other operating expenses_

Our other operating expenses increased by €18.0 million, or 9.4%, from €192.2 million in FY 2018 to
€210.2 million in FY 2019. Other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly to 29.1% in
FY 2019 as compared to 29.6% in FY 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased variable costs
corresponding to the expansion of the e-commerce sales channel, partially offset by lower general marketing
costs in advance of the entry into India and the conversion to company owned-and-operated distribution in line
with our DTC strategy.

_Net profit_

Our net profit increased by €31.2 million, or 28.1%, from €110.9 million in FY 2018 to €142.0 million in
FY 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the factors described above.

Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by €2.0 million, or 7.9%, from €25.3 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2019 to €27 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was
primarily impacted by the add-back of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by €27.6 million, or 15.0%, from €183.7 million in FY 2019 to
€211.3 million in FY 2020. Adjusted EBITDA during the period was primarily impacted by one-off expenses
related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in particular the shutdown of our production
facilities for two months and closures of retail stores during FY 2020.

Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by €6.3 million, or 3.6%, from €177.4 million in FY 2018 to
€183.7 million in FY 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income during FY 2019.

**Liquidity and Capital resources**

**_Overview_**

Our primary liquidity requirements are to service our debt, to fund our operations and for other general
corporate purposes. Our ability to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating
performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market,
legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors including
those discussed in this section and the section entitled “Risk Factors.” Following the completion of the
Transactions, we expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be cash flows from operations and drawings
under our ABL Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—ABL Facility Agreement.”

We introduced a number of early and comprehensive measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to
safeguard our liquidity, including temporary cost controls related to travel and entertainment, curtailment of
consulting spend, and changes in shipment to wholesalers on normal credit terms. In particular, we received
short-time working compensation (KUG) from the German federal employment agency in the amount of
€6.1 million for FY 2020 and implemented measures aimed at reducing costs. We incurred certain costs related
to the COVID-19 pandemic, including unplanned idle costs of €16.7 million (excluding idle costs assumed in
budget or outside the shutdown period) reflecting personnel expenses, depreciation and other fixed costs related
to the production facilities, one-time training costs of €3.2 million, payment of one-time employee bonuses and
other additional costs associated with stocking raw materials in March 2020 in anticipation of delays and supply
chain disruptions. We also incurred other costs related to disinfecting production sites and offices and purchasing
face masks for our employees.

We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate future
financing cash flows will be limited by the Indenture and Senior Secured Facilities, which may have important
negative consequences for you. See “Risk Factors,” “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants” and
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” Any additional indebtedness that we incur could reduce the
amount of our cash flow available to make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including under the
Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage.

**_Cash Flows_**

The following table sets forth the principal components of our cash flows for FY 2018, FY 2019 and FY
2020 and for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

_Cash flow from operating activities_

Cash outflows from operating activities decreased by €55.8 million, or 93.1%, from an outflow of
€59.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2019 to an outflow of €4.1 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower decrease in inventories as a result from
a restocking of finished goods, trade receivables and other assets and a lower decrease trade liabilities and other
liabilities, partially offset by the lower net income in the period.

Cash flow from operating activities increased by €32.6 million, or 24.1%, from €135.3 million in FY 2019
to €167.9 million in FY 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the positive effect of the reduction of
inventories in the amount of €31.7 million in FY 2020 to meet customer demand following the production
shutdown in April 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cash flow from operating activities increased by €84.1 million, or 164.1%, from €51.2 million in FY 2018
to €135.3 million in FY 2019. The increase was primarily driven by our net income for the year. There were
countervailing trends from the increase in inventories by €36.9 million. In contrast, the receivables and other
assets decreased by €8.8 million. The increased consolidated net income and the prior-year effect in the cash
flow statement from the payment of liabilities resulting from the accrual of Footwear Distribution GmbH & Co.
KG in FY 2017.

_Cash flow from investing activities_

Our cash outflows from investing activities decreased by €4.4 million, or 63.9%, from an outflow of
€6.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2019 to an outflow of €2.5 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in payments for tangible and
intangible assets, relating to projects capitalized either as IT projects (hardware and software) or production
investments.

Our cash outflows from investing activities decreased by €16.8 million, or 44.1%, from an outflow of
€38.1 million in FY 2019 to an outflow of €21.3 million in FY 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a
decrease of investments into tangible assets. The capital expenditure of the BIRKENSTOCK Group in FY 2020
totaled to €23.5 million.

Our cash outflows from investing activities increased by €22.8 million, or 148.0%, from an outflow of
€15.3 million in FY 2018 to an outflow of €38.1 million in FY 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an
increase in payments for investments in tangible assets and intangible assets related to machinery and technical
equipment and concessions, patents, licenses and similar rights. The capital expenditure of the BIRKENSTOCK
Group in FY 2019 totaled to €38.4 million.

_Cash flow from financing activities_

Our cash inflows from financing activities decreased by €72.4 million, or 131.4%, from an inflow of
€55.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2019 to an outflow of €17.3 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2020. Due to our faster cash conversion cycles as a result of the increased proportion of
e-commerce sales, which led to higher cash levels during the period, and as a result, we did not need to draw
under financings. In the prior period, however, cash flows increased due to the cash proceeds of €70.9 million
from drawings under our financing arrangements in the three months ended December 31, 2019.

Our cash outflows from financing activities decreased by €24.5 million, or 23.2%, from an outflow of
€105.6 million in FY 2019 to an outflow of €81.1 million in FY 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by
lower repayments on bank borrowings in FY 2020 as compared to the prior period.

Our cash outflows from financing activities increased by €90.2 million, or 584.6% from an outflow of
€15.4 million in FY 2018 to an outflow of €105.6 million in FY 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the
repayment of a syndicated loan in the amount of €54.1 million whereas in FY 2018 repayments on loans were
offset by €97.2 million in cash proceeds received from financings.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures primarily relate to capacity increases for our production facilities and efficiency
programs of our supply chain, IT system and investments in regular business activities. Our capital expenditures
as a percentage of revenues was 2.5%, 5.3%, and 3.2% in FY 2018, FY 2019 and FY 2020, respectively, and
6.9% and 2.0% in the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

-----

Our capital expenditures decreased by €4.6 million, from €7.2 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2019, to €2.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily
driven by the delay of certain capital expenditures related to projects other than a project related to IT
improvements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our capital expenditures decreased by €14.9 million, from €38.4 million in FY 2019 to €23.5 million in FY
2020. The decrease was primarily driven by investments and other projects in FY 2020 as part of our costreducing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our capital expenditures increased by €21.9 million, from €16.5 million in FY 2018 to €38.4 million in FY
2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in payments for investments in intangible assets related
to machinery and technical equipment.

**Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**

Our provisions for pensions are determined actuarially based on bio-metric probabilities, using the projected
unit credit method. Expected future salary and pension increases are accounted for in determining the relevant
obligations. Currently, we use annual adjustments amounting to 0.00 % p.a. for pension entitlements and 1.50%
to 2.50 % p.a. for pensions. The interest rate calculations for the discounting of pension obligations amounts to
2.41% p.a. for FY 2020, and to 2.82 % p.a. for FY 2019. We determined this rate based on the average market
rate for the past ten years as determined and published by the German Federal Bank for an assumed remaining
term of 15 years. Where reinsurance policies have been taken out to cover the pension obligations, which are not
accessible to all other creditors, the value of the provision was offset against the fair value of the covering assets.

We recognized provisions for pensions and similar obligations of €1.8 million, €2.2 million and €2.2 million
as of September 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and €2.3 million as of December 31, 2020.

For more detail, see note III to the 2020 Financial Statements.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Risk Management**

We are exposed to financial risks in the form of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk during the course
of our ordinary business activities. Market risk relates to the potential fluctuation of fair values or future cash
flows of non-derivative or derivative financial instruments. Among market risks relevant to our business are
foreign currency and interest rate risks. Associated with these risks are fluctuations in income, equity and cash
flow.

Non-financial or non-quantifiable risks, such as business risks or reputational risks, are not considered here.

**_Foreign currency risk_**

Our reporting currency is the euro and we are exposed to currency risk for translation risk and transaction
risk as we operate internationally. Our income from currency translation was €1.3 million and €14.9 million for
FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively. Our expenses from currency translation were €18.6 million and €8.8 million
for FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively. In FY September 30, 2020, 42.7% of our revenues were generated in US
dollars in the United States which is our largest individual market. On the expense side, most of our raw
materials and semi-finished products are purchased predominantly in Germany or within the EU and our core
products are manufactured in Germany.

For the reporting of our consolidated financial statements, the financial results of our subsidiaries that do not
report in euro are translated to euro from the applicable foreign currency. The process by which we translate each
foreign subsidiary’s financial results to euro is as follows:

   - Assets and liabilities of the balance sheet are translated into euro at the mean spot exchange rate on the
reporting date, except for shareholders’ equity which is translated at the historic rate at the time of
initial consolidation.

   - Items in the income statement are translated at the average exchange rate for the applicable financial
year.

Differences arising from currency translation are disclosed separately within group equity under the item
“Equity difference from currency translation.” Currency differences from both debt consolidation and the
elimination of intercompany profits and losses are disclosed in the income statement under the item “Other
operating expenses.”

90


-----

Prior to FY 2019, we managed the transaction risk, especially for revenues, by invoicing customers in euros
at all locations. We expect to gradually phase out this practice in the future as we set the objective of invoicing at
our selected foreign subsidiaries in local currency and managing foreign currency risks actively on a central
basis. Beginning in FY 2019, we implemented local currency invoicing in the United States. To monitor and
mitigate foreign currency risk, we enter into hedging arrangements with flexible currency forwards and currency
swaps. We continuously monitor foreign currency exchange developments that are relevant to our operations.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Our exposure to interest rate risk is related to our syndicated loan, entered into on September 13, 2017, that
bears a floating interest rate. We manage interest rate risk through our zero-floored forward interest rate swap
that is comprised of two derivatives, €50 million each, and has been effective since December 31, 2019.
Following the Transactions, we will be exposed to additional interest rate risk. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to Our Capital Structure—Some of our indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Facilities, will bear interest at_
_floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow.”_

The fair value of these two interest rate derivatives amounted to €(1.6) million as of September 30, 2020 and
2019. The hedge exists in each case for at least the entire term of the underlying transaction until September 30,
2022.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our management must make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
Financial Statements, based on historical experience, existing and known circumstances, authoritative accounting
pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable, but actual results could differ
materially from these estimates. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and cannot be
reasonably estimated for these key estimates. However, we made appropriate accounting estimates based on the
facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. To the extent there are differences between these
estimates and actual results, our Financial Statements may be materially affected. Our management believes the
following critical accounting policies are most significantly affected by judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of our Financial Statements: revenue recognition, taxes on income, intangible assets and provisions.

We apply estimates and judgments by management especially in the following accounting policies.

**_Revenue recognition_**

Revenues are recognized when all of the below conditions are met:

   - the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products have transferred to the customer,

   - we no longer retain the control normally associated with ownership or effective control over the goods
sold,

   - the amount of revenue and assumed costs and future costs can be measured reliably, and

   - it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the company.

Economic ownership of a product is transferred when the product is shipped or when it is delivered to the
customer, which is specified in the contract or order.

If a product is sold to a customer with a right of return, revenue can only be recognized at the time of sale if
the following conditions are met in full:

   - at the time of sale, the selling price of the goods is essentially fixed or at least determinable,

   - the customer has already paid the consideration in exchange of the product, or is obliged to do so, and
this obligation is not linked to a successful resale of the product,

   - the customer’s obligations under the sales contract do not change in the event of theft of, physical
destruction of or damage to the products,

   - a customer who purchases the products for resale has its own economic capacity, which exists
regardless of whether economic support is provided by the company,

91


-----

   - no significant obligations are assumed to directly induce the resale of the product by the customer in
the future, and

   - the volume of future product returns can be reasonably estimated.

Revenue is disclosed net of sales deductions such as discounts, price reductions and rebates and net of
expected product returns.

Expected product returns are estimated based on our historical return rate adjusted for any known factors
impacting expectations for future return rate. The return rate impacts reported revenue and profitability.

**_Taxes on income_**

Taxes on income consists of current income tax and deferred tax. Deferred taxes are calculated for
temporary differences between the value of assets, liabilities and deferred items under German GAAP and their
tax values, which are expected to reverse in future financial years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted
off when applicable.

Deferred tax assets for tax losses carried forward are capitalized to the extent that adequate deferred tax
liabilities are available. These deferred tax assets are offset against the deferred tax liabilities.

For FY 2020, deferred taxes were calculated based on a tax rate of 14% in Germany for Birkenstock
GmbH & Co. KG and this rate was equivalent to an average trade tax rate of the tax group. For the other German
companies and the foreign companies in the BIRKENSTOCK Group, individual corporate tax rates were set in a
range from 14 % to 40%.

**_Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets are measured at cost, less straight-line amortization. Industrial property rights and similar
rights and assets including licenses, with the exception of the brand name, are amortized over a useful life of
three to fifteen years.

The brand name “Birkenstock” included in the intangible assets is amortized over a period of 35 years.
Carrying amount of the brand was €170.6 million as of September 30, 2020.

Goodwill arises from the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and the consideration
paid and is amortized, depending on its expected useful life, over a period of five to fifteen years. When
determining the depreciation period, estimates are made as to over which period the acquired business is
expected to produce a positive contribution to results. A useful life of more than five years has been set for
positive contributions of a corresponding organization, where reasonable.

Self-developed intangible assets are capitalized only when research and development stages are separable,
and the below conditions are met:

   - completion of the asset is technically feasible,

   - ability to generate economic benefit, via internal use or sale, from the asset is possible, and

   - expenses which are allocated to the asset can be measured during its development stage.

We do not have any self-developed intangible asset on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2020.

**_Provisions_**

Provisions include provisions for pension and similar obligations and tax and other provisions.

Provisions for pension and similar obligations are determined by using actuarial assumptions and other
estimations. The actuarial approach is based on biometric probabilities using the projected unit credit method and
includes expected future salary and pension increases. Currently, we use annual adjustments for pension
entitlements amounting to 0.00% p.a. and for pensions amounting to 1.50% to 2.50% p.a. The interest rate we use
to discount pension obligations amounts to 2.41% p.a. which is the average market rate of the past ten years as
determined and published by the German Federal Bank for an assumed remaining term of 15 years. As we have
reclaim insurance policies in place to cover these obligations, the provision is offset against the plan assets. Plan
assets must meet the following requirements:

   - They serve exclusively to meet pension obligations, and

92


-----

   - Repayment of capital to the company is possible only in the event of excess cover and if the company
is legally independent of the reporting company.

Creditors cannot access these assets (in particular in the event of insolvency). If these requirements are met,
these assets are recorded in our balance sheet at fair value. If the assets’ fair value exceeds the corresponding
obligations, the excess amount is recorded as an asset, while the net liability positions are to be recognized as
provisions.

Tax and other provisions are set up for recognizable risks and uncertain liabilities and measured at the
settlement amount required in accordance with reasonable commercial judgement. Future price and cost
increases are taken into account to determine the settlement amount where necessary. Provisions with a
remaining term of more than one year are discounted at the average market interest rate for the past seven
financial years corresponding to their remaining term.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued, which are adopted by us as of the specified
effective date. We believe that the adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our
Financial Statements.

**Overview**

We are an iconic brand globally renowned for crafting high quality, durable footwear that enriches the
health and wellbeing of our customers’ lives. With a proud heritage that dates back to our founding in 1774 in
Langen-Bernheim, Germany, BIRKENSTOCK has evolved today into one of the foremost footwear brands in the
world. We are best known as the inventors of the cork footbed which is rooted in orthopedic theory and
encourages proper foot wellbeing, by evenly distributing weight and reducing pressure points in order to
re-emphasize natural walking. Today, we use this legendary footbed across all of our footwear styles, several of
which have developed significant global recognition and acclaim of their own. Our large product archive
comprises hundreds of styles, with our five core product families—the Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the
Madrid and the Boston—representing the vast majority of our sales, contributing nearly 75% of our revenues in
FY 2020. We produce our silhouettes in various textiles including traditional leather, shearling, EVA and our
trademarked, leather alternative BirkFlor[®]. Our products span a number of price points, with EVA products at
the lower end, and our 1774 branded collaborations at the luxury end of the spectrum. We are also increasingly
diversifying into closed-toe shoes, including clogs, boots and sneakers, and expanding our range of athletic /
outdoor, orthopedic, kids and professional footwear, all of which we expect to drive accelerated growth in our
business in coming years.

We distribute our products through wholesale partners (including distributors and retail partners), and
through our DTC channels: e-commerce, which represents an increasing amount of our sales, and our owned
retail stores. Our products are distributed around the world, reaching consumers in nearly 100 countries. We
organize our business into four regional hubs: the Americas, Europe, ASPA, and MEAI. Of these hubs, the
Americas and Europe are our two largest, representing 47% and 41% of total FY 2020 revenue, respectively.

As a result of our product portfolio and geographical footprint, the following market description relates to
the global footwear market.

**Global footwear market**

According to Euromonitor, the global footwear market (which includes all men’s, women’s and children’s
footwear across athletic and non-athletic categories) generated an estimated US$286.0 billion in sales in 2020,
and is expected to generate US$322.7 billion in 2021.

The global footwear market experienced steady growth at a 4.1% CAGR from 2015 to 2019. As a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic, the global footwear market saw a sharp decline of 19.0% from 2019 to 2020 driven by
closures of physical retail locations, and an acceleration in the decline of formal footwear sales given limited
usage occasions as people transitioned to a home-working environment and many events were cancelled. Over
the same period, we have outperformed the broader footwear market, growing at a 17.4% CAGR from FY 2016
to FY 2019, and experiencing growth of 1.2% in FY 2020. The global footwear market is expected to witness a
recovery in sales in 2021 and is subsequently expected to grow at a 6.5% CAGR from 2021 to 2025.

growth at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2021 to 2025. Our business is relatively nascent in ASPA, and as such we see
significant opportunity for growth as we invest in our brand in the region.

The Americas, our largest market, represented 30% of total global footwear sales in 2020, after experiencing
growth at a CAGR of 3.5% from 2015 to 2019. Growth in the region is expected to accelerate in 2021 to 2025 to

**Drivers of growth in the footwear market**

**_Ongoing trend towards casual styles_**


Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a multi-year shift towards more casual dress, with the
proportion of firms with a casual dress code in the US increasing from approximately 30% in 2014 to 50% in
2018 according to public industry sources. Sales of dress shoes in the US fell over 10% in 2019, with declines
increasing to over 70% in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which has catalyzed an acceleration
towards casualization, according to public industry sources. The ongoing trend, which we believe will continue
to drive purchasing decisions, has the potential to provide a significant tailwind for businesses like ours. As a
result, we believe iconic businesses that stand for functionality, quality, and “better for you” comfort such as us
will outperform the broader segment.

**_Shift towards online commerce_**


The migration of commerce to the digital world has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic as physical
retail locations across the world have been, and continue to be, closed across a number of markets due to
lockdown orders. Online sales in the global footwear industry reached $74 billion in 2020 according to
Euromonitor, representing 26% of total footwear sales, up from 11% in 2015. It is anticipated that this shift to
online commerce will continue in the coming years, and we look to capitalize on this trend with investments in
the online direct-to-consumer channel.

**_Continued focus on sustainability_**

In a crowded footwear market flooded with fast fashion, consumers are becoming increasingly
knowledgeable about their purchases and aware of the impacts of their purchasing decisions. According to
multiple public industry sources, over 70% of consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainable products.
We are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend as sustainability has always been integral to our brand.

**Competition**

We are the global leader in the sandal category within the footwear market, based on management’s
estimates and industry knowledge. The broader global footwear market remains highly fragmented, with the top
five players accounting for less than 25% market share according to Euromonitor. While this implies a
competitive market structure, we believe there is significant opportunity for brands with strong awareness and
high-quality products to take market share.

While we do not compete with any one single company with respect to the entire spectrum of our portfolio,
competition is primarily based on brand awareness, product functionality, quality and durability, design and
comfort, and marketing and distribution. We also believe that our brand equity, paired with our superior
products, with their orthopedic foundations, high-quality materials and focus on comfort and functionality,
position us well to continue competing in the global wholesale, retail and online channels.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are an iconic brand globally renowned for crafting high quality, durable footwear that enriches the
health and wellbeing of our customers’ lives. With a proud heritage that dates back to our founding in 1774 in
Langen-Bernheim, Germany, BIRKENSTOCK has evolved into one of the foremost footwear brands in the
world, selling approximately 23 million units in nearly 100 countries worldwide and generating €753.8 million of
revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of €213.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.

We are best known as the inventors of the contoured footbed which, rooted in orthopedic theory, encourages
proper foot wellbeing, reduces pressure points, and re-emphasizes natural walking. Today, we use this legendary
footbed across all our footwear styles, several of which have developed significant global recognition and
acclaim of their own. While we have a deep and diversified assortment comprised of hundreds of styles, our five
“core classics”—the Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the Madrid and the Boston—generated nearly 75% of our
annual revenues for FY 2020 and continue to enjoy significant global consumer demand today. In fact, the
BIRKENSTOCK Arizona was the number one searched shoe in the world in Q2 2020, while our shearling-lined
Boston clogs ranked as the number two most-searched women’s shoe in Q4 2020, according to public industry
sources.

We believe that how things are made matters as much as the product itself; we make our products with deep
respect for German and European standards for ethical, social, and environmental responsibility. To that end, we
maintain strict controls over our entire supply chain—from carefully selecting high quality, sustainable materials
from our largely European supply base to hand-finishing our products in our five owned manufacturing facilities
across Germany—and a relentless focus on creating well-made, functional, and durable products. As a
consequence of our focus on quality craftsmanship, we proudly employ 3,137 skilled laborers across Germany
and represent the largest employer in the German footwear industry.

Our unwavering commitment to creating functional products with integrity throughout our nearly 250-year
history has enabled us to build an unparalleled brand reputation. Today, the BIRKENSTOCK brand has become
synonymous with the highest standards of quality, durability, and craftsmanship, enabling us to engender
best-in-class levels of consumer loyalty and trust. As one of the original inclusive brands, we are proud of the
fact that our brand and products are worn and loved by consumers around the world, regardless of age, gender,
income, and race.

The breadth of our brand and the loyalty of our global fan base have enabled us to operate from the peculiar
but privileged position where demand for our products has historically exceeded supply. This dynamic has
allowed us to create scarcity in the market and control our brand while simultaneously driving highly predictable
and consistent growth—even through the COVID-19 pandemic—as demonstrated by the compound annual
growth rate of our revenues of approximately 10% from FY 2017 (giving effect to the Birkenstock USA
Reorganization) to FY 2020. This growth has been broad-based across most channels and geographies—though
we have seen meaningful recent acceleration in our owned direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels, which have
rapidly expanded from approximately 18% of revenues in FY 2018 to approximately 32% of revenues in the
twelve months ended December 31, 2020. We believe that DTC channels—in particular, our owned e-commerce
channel—will continue to generate an increasing portion of our revenues and profits going forward.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Timeless and iconic brand rooted in 250 years of orthopedic tradition_**

We are built on nearly 250 years of orthopedic tradition. BIRKENSTOCK was created in 1774 when
cobbler Johann Adam Birkenstock was registered as “vassal and shoemaker” in the church archives in the small
Hessian village of Langen-Bergheim, Germany.

98


-----

In the late 1800s, Johann’s great-great-grandson, master cobbler Konrad Birkenstock, invented the Fußbett
(“footbed”) a sole that supported the contours of the foot and promoted the wearer’s orthopedic well-being . The
footbed, which was adapted specifically for the growing factory manufactured footwear market, included
contoured arch supports made from a baked mixture of cork and latex to produce a light, resilient material
capable of supporting the body’s weight. At a time when other foot supports were made of flat, unyielding metal,
the footbed was revolutionary. In 1915, Konrad’s son, Carl Birkenstock, joined the family business. Father and
son became renowned orthopedic authorities, publishing numerous books and articles and traveling extensively
throughout Europe conducting seminars and trainings on orthopedic theory.

In 1964, Carl’s son, Karl Birkenstock, took his grandfather’s footbed one step further by adding a sole and a
leather strap that ran across the wearer’s toes. And thus, the first modern BIRKENSTOCK sandal, the Madrid,
was born. Originally launched as a fitness shoe, the design offered a multitude of ergonomic benefits to its
wearers—including to activate the grip reflex of the toes as one walks, exercising one’s foot and leg muscles.
The Madrid became an instant classic.

99


-----

Over the subsequent decades, we have gone on to launch hundreds of new styles and silhouettes, but all
have had one thing in common: the footbed. Konrad’s footbed and, perhaps more importantly, his revolutionary
foresight in creating products that enhance one’s whole health and wellbeing, remain the foundation of the
BIRKENSTOCK brand. Our origins and traditions still guide everything we do—from the way we select our
materials to the way we craft our products.

We believe our approach to holistic health and wellbeing has global appeal. As one of the original inclusive
brands, BIRKENSTOCK products are worn by people all over the world, regardless of age, income, race, or
gender. Our most popular products are unisex in nature and we offer products across the pricing spectrum,
ranging from €40 for our EVA products up to €400 for products from our premium 1774 collection. Most of our
core classics sell in the €75-100 range, which we believe to be a democratic and achievable price point for much
of the general population. The below chart illustrates the appeal of our brand to a broad array of customers in
Germany and the United States.

Our longstanding commitment to creating products of the highest quality has enabled us to establish a
pristine brand reputation that has resulted in a highly engaged and loyal fan base. For many of these consumers,
BIRKENSTOCK is more than just a brand, it is a way of life. In a third-party survey, approximately 69% of
surveyed customers indicated they own more than one pair of BIRKENSTOCKs and approximately 90% of
recent surveyed BIRKENSTOCK purchasers indicated a desire to repurchase our products. We are proud of our
high retention rates as our customers’ desire to repurchase is the ultimate testament to their satisfaction with our

As time has enabled us to cement our reputation for producing high quality products, so too has it enabled
us to become a dominate player in the sandal category. The distinctive and instantly recognizable aesthetic of our
products—which we believe to be the perfect blend of function and design—have enabled us to create categories
of our own, a phenomenon that has created enormous competitive advantages for our brand. To illustrate,
approximately 51% of BIRKENSTOCK purchasers who participated in a third-party survey over the last two
years did not consider purchasing any other brand. That is to say, for over half of such BIRKENSTOCK
purchasers, we do not compete against any other brand.

_Converse, Ugg and Timberland._

Our unique and ownable aesthetic have also resulted in significant unsolicited attention from various wellknown brands seeking to create collaborations. For us, it is important that collaborations not only align with our
brand values but also push the brand forward through infusing new creative ideas. Thus, we work selectively
with brands—many with creative directors who are Birkenstock fans themselves—that we believe will craft
original products that enhance the standing of our brand. Through our 1774 line, we have conceived of and
launched multiple collaborations with labels as diverse as Stüssy, Rick Owens, and Valentino. These
collaborations, profitable in and of themselves, also serve as differentiated marketing vehicles, enabling us to
create a “halo” around BIRKENSTOCK, and to amplify our brand reach to new consumers in a cost-effective
manner. We believe our distinctive and successful use of collaborations, along with organic, unpaid support from
celebrities, have generated significant earned media.

**_Favored by societal megatrends towards casual styles, wellness, and sustainability_**

While “health and wellness” has been gaining traction with consumers over recent years, this way of
thinking has been in our brand’s DNA for centuries. Our products—specifically, our footbed—are rooted in the
orthopedic theory pioneered by Konrad Birkenstock and designed to improve foot health and restore a natural
gait.

The increased prioritization of health and wellness by the modern consumer has had dramatic and longlasting impacts on lifestyle and consumption patterns. Within the broader soft goods category in which we
operate, this has resulted, for example, in an increasing desire for comfort and function over “fashion”. These
preferences have fundamentally changed the way consumers dress today, not just at the gym or in their home but
at the workplace as well. Between 2014 and 2018, the proportion of businesses with casual dress codes increased
from approximately 30% to approximately 50% prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 according to public industry
sources. We believe the shift towards more casual styles will only further accelerate as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and the further blurring of “in-home” and “out-of-home” dress. As a brand that has prioritized health
and wellbeing for centuries, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this ongoing shift.

Similarly, the modern consumer is increasingly prioritizing sustainability and becoming more aware of and
focused on the ESG profiles of the brands they purchase. Approximately 70% of consumers believe that
sustainability is extremely or very important when purchasing fashion, according to public industry sources. In
addition, approximately 65% of consumers state that they intend to buy more high-quality items that last longer
according to McKinsey’s Report: Consumer Sentiment on Sustainability in Fashion. For us, sustainability is not a
matter of retrofitting our brand or labelling ourselves as “green” just to fit a consumer trend but is instead a
genuine way of thinking that has been deeply embedded in our ethos and way of doing business for decades. As a
result, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this ongoing emerging societal focus given the
longstanding importance of both using sustainable materials as well as ethical production to the brand.

We utilize sustainable raw materials—most notably, cork, a naturally lightweight, breathable, and insulating
material—in the production of our shoes. Cork is a highly versatile natural material that can be harvested
multiple times without harming the tree. We source 100% of our cork—specifically, the waste byproduct of cork
used to manufacture high-quality wine stoppers—from small, family-held farms in Portugal. We then bake a
mixture of this cork with latex—in one of our two owned footbed production sites—to form our legendary
footbeds.

Our vertically integrated supply chain represents a key source of competitive advantage and enables us to
uphold high standards of ethical production. As with our cork, most of our raw materials are sourced from across
Europe in accordance with our established Code of Conduct that lays out the strict ethical and social standards
for our business. We include this Code of Conduct in all our supplier contracts to ensure that our suppliers
consistently abide by these high standards. Furthermore, we produce nearly all our products in Germany through
our five owned manufacturing facilities. See “Business—Supply Chain—Production.” By fully controlling the
production process, we know where and how our products are made, enabling us to maintain a clean and ethical
supply chain.

**_Core product icons drive consistent and recurring growth supported by complementary diversification into_**
**_adjacent footwear sub-categories_**

While we have a large product assortment comprised of hundreds of styles, our five core product families—
the Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the Madrid and the Boston—still represent the vast majority of our revenue,
contributing nearly 75% of our revenues in FY 2020. Apart from the Mayari, all these product franchises have
been on the market for decades, providing us with a highly predictable and consistent sales base. At the same
time, we have consistently demonstrated the ability to drive growth within a product family through color and
material innovation, enabling us to expand and introduce newness into our assortment with minimal risk. Growth
in our Arizona franchise, for instance, has been driven by both the core leather styles as well as through textile
innovation (e.g., recent launch of shearling and EVA franchises, and the use of other seasonal materials and
prints). As a result, revenues from sales of the Arizona silhouette have grown at a compounded annual growth
rate of 23% between FY 2016 and FY 2020.

In recent years, we have specifically focused on growing our closed-toe shoe assortment, which represented
approximately 4% of our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. We believe our strategic
focus on the closed-toe segment—which houses significant growth potential given higher average selling prices
and broader applicability across different seasons and usage occasions—is now bearing fruit. For example,
revenues from the Boston, a clog originally introduced in 1978, have grown at a compounded annual growth rate
of 13% between FY 2016 and FY 2020, as we expanded the style count and more prominently showcased the
Boston in our e-commerce and retail channels.

We also continue to invest in the orthopedic heritage of our brand, including recently forming a
biomechanics team focused on driving new technical innovations. In particular, we see significant runway in
functionally driven footwear categories such as the adventure / outdoor, orthopedic and professional segments.
We believe that innovations in these sub-vertical markets will enable the BIRKENSTOCK brand to reach new
customers and broaden its usage occasions, all while delivering on our legacy of quality, durability, and
craftsmanship.

**_Profitable growth through evolution to owned distribution channels_**

Much of our recent growth may be attributable to our deliberate strategy of increasing DTC penetration,
which enables us to purposefully and consistently express our brand identity while engaging directly with our
global fan base. Our direct-to-consumer channels (comprised of our owned e-commerce and retail channels)
represented approximately 18% of our revenues in FY 2018 and have grown to approximately 32% in the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020.

The DTC acceleration has been driven primarily by our owned e-commerce channel, which has grown at a
47% compounded annual growth rate between FY 2018 and FY 2020 and comprised 28% of our overall group
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Since 2016, we have invested a significant amount in
our online platform in order to drive this channel shift and by the end of 2020 we had launched
BIRKENSTOCK.com in 24 markets. Our e-commerce channel enables us to offer the broadest assortment as

103


-----

well as a direct channel for communication with our consumers. E-commerce also has the added financial benefit
of driving strong profit margins and enhancing the overall profitability of our overall business.

At approximately 4% of overall group revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our retail
channel represents a small, but complementary, segment of our DTC business. Most of our 52 retail locations are
in Germany, given our brand history, where we operate a network of 35 locations as of November 2020. We have
more recently embarked on a strategy of opening flagship retail locations, such as Soho and Brooklyn in New
York City, Venice Beach in California and Soho in London. While retail represents an important channel where
consumers engage physically with our brand and products, we remain extremely disciplined with our approach to
managing our footprint and highly selective with respect to profitability and expected paybacks. Going forward,
we may consider strategic additions to our retail footprint in brand appropriate locations, such as in the United
States, where we only have three locations.

Finally, our wholesale channel, which represented 68.2% of our overall group revenues for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020, enables us to broaden our distribution network and reach. Wholesale, which
spans our direct business with retail partners and our relationships with distribution partners in certain markets,
plays an important role in providing physical distribution and increasing our brand awareness globally. For our
wholesale partners, we represent an important, “must carry” brand within the footwear category given the
strength of our brand name and the customers that we attract. As a result, we generate significantly more demand
from existing and prospective new wholesale customers than we can supply, putting us in an enviable position
where we can create scarcity in the market and control our brand image. This dynamic has also enabled us to
focus on deepening our relationships with best-in-class retailers who strengthen our brand image and who extend
our reach to new and attractive customer demographics.

The antecedent for our ability to drive DTC growth in a market is the conversion of that market from a
distribution-led model to a company owned-and-operated model. Historically, the BIRKENSTOCK Group has
operated primarily as a manufacturer and supplier of high-quality footwear, relying primarily on third-party
distributors to market, sell, and expand the reach of the brand into new territories. However, today, as a result of
our strategy to increase ownership of our distribution channels, our wholesale business is comprised of a
combination of direct wholesale customers as well as legacy third-party distributors. Beginning with the
distribution takeover of the U.S. market in 2007 and legal reorganization in 2009, and accelerating after the
appointment of the first co-CEOs from outside the Birkenstock family in 2012 and our Managing Director of the
Americas in the following year, we have focused on further vertically integrating these functions into our
corporate organization to enable us greater control over the brand and distribution. Our distribution takeovers
have been critical to our success, enabling us to build brand equity while driving accelerated sales and
profitability growth. For example, in the U.S., we have grown revenues from approximately $42 million in FY
2012 to $349 million in FY 2020. Taking over direct distribution in the U.S. has allowed us to invest in
relationships only with wholesalers that are aligned with and act as custodians of our brand while also enabling
us to launch our e-commerce site in 2016 and open flagship retail stores in Soho and Brooklyn in, New York City
and Venice Beach in, California.

**_Passionate, experienced, and proven management team delivering strong financial performance supported by_**
**_a committed Sponsor_**

We benefit from the industry expertise and know-how of our passionate, experienced, and proven senior
management team, which has an average of more than 15 years of industry experience. In 2012, for the first time
in our history, we put executive leadership in place from outside the Birkenstock family. This was a pivot point
for the business, turning BIRKENSTOCK from a family-run organization to a powerful, global business that has
now experienced double digit growth for the last four years and has significantly increased profitability. Our
management team is currently led by Oliver Reichert, our Chief Executive Officer; Philipp Türoff, our Chief
Financial Officer; Markus Baum, our Chief Product Officer; Klaus Bauman, our Chief Sales Officer; and David
Kahan, our Managing Director of Americas.

Our management team has been instrumental in delivering our growth and strong financial performance. We
have experienced consistent and strong revenue growth during this period, demonstrating resilient growth even
during the period impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our revenues have grown at a compound annual growth
rate of approximately 10% from €648 million for FY 2018 to €754 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020. Our growth reflects our increasing brand reputation and customer demand globally that has

104


-----

been increasingly converted into revenue through our owned channels (i.e., owned retail stores and owned online
channels). We have also experienced consistent improvement in our profitability, demonstrated by the increase in
Adjusted EBITDA from €177.4 million for FY 2018 to €211.3 million for FY 2020, growing at a compound
annual growth rate of approximately 9%. Our Adjusted Free Cash Flow increased from approximately
€131 million in FY 2018 to approximately €239 million in FY 2020. Our stable Adjusted EBITDA margins of at
least 25% from FY 2018 to the twelve months ended December 30, 2020 and our strong cash conversion reflects
our brand strength and a diversified, vertically integrated business model with continued runway as distribution
shifts further into our owned channels.

We also benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge, and experience of our new
Sponsor. L Catterton is one of the largest and most experienced consumer-focused private equity groups in the
world, with approximately $26 billion of equity capital under management and over 30 years of experience
building iconic and enduring consumer brands. L Catterton was established in 2016 through a partnership among
Catterton, LVMH and Groupe Arnault, and today the three firms actively collaborate in areas such as consumer
insights, brand strategies, supply chain / distribution to leverage shared experiences and knowhow across the
portfolio.

**Our Strategies**

We and our Sponsor have developed the following strategies, which reflect a continuation of the journey
that we have been on over the last decade.

**_Building consumer awareness and familiarity globally_**

Our longstanding commitment to creating products of the highest quality has enabled us to establish our
global, leading brand reputation. The BIRKENSTOCK brand has become synonymous with timeless, durable,
and functional footwear with sustainability and health & wellbeing at its core. Without question, our brand is our
greatest asset and has been key to our long-term sales growth and profitability margins.

As a result of our longstanding focus on creating sustainable, “better for you” products, we believe we are
well-positioned to benefit from several of long-term secular shifts in consumer preferences, including the
increasing focus on ESG and prioritization of health and wellness. The strong and longstanding alignment of our
values with these changes in consumer purchase criteria will continue to drive outsized growth for our brand, as
more consumers discover our products and learn about our brand ethos.

To reach even more new consumers and grow our global fan base, we will continue to launch high-profile
collaborations with a diverse range of brands and creators across different industries and geographies. In the past,
these collaborations have not only been profitable, but have also enabled us to increase our brand reach to new
customers, including those in new demographics and geographies. While we have a robust pipeline of exciting
collaborations, we remain highly selective, frequently turning down partnerships that we do not believe enhance
the standing of our brand.

We have also identified several opportunities to build awareness in specific demographics. For example,
while our presence is still nascent in Asia, we believe there is potential for significant growth based on a
comparison to the success of some of our peers in the region who are relatively new market entrants. Finally, we
are also expanding our range of kids and professional footwear, all of which we expect to drive accelerated
growth in our business in coming years.

**_Accelerating the direct-to-consumer shift to continue to build brand equity and enhance margins_**

Our deliberate strategy of increasing DTC penetration—which is most evolved in the United States given
our early distribution takeover of that market—enables us to express our brand identity purposefully and
consistently while directly engaging with our global fan base. Our direct-to-customer acceleration has been
driven primarily by our e-commerce channel, which has grown at a 47% compounded annual growth rate
between FY 2018 and FY 2020 to comprise 25% of our overall group revenues for FY 2020, supported by our
investments in our online platform in recent years. The increasing proportion of DTC sales has significantly
contributed to our growing profit margins and profitability.

105


-----

We intend to replicate the success of our U.S. DTC strategy across Europe and Asia, which we expect will
lay the foundation for long-term, accretive growth. Our primary avenue of DTC will be through our e-commerce
sales channel, which we have been rapidly growing through new online store openings since 2016, with the most
recent being our online store in India added in 2020. Going forward, we may consider strategic additions to our
retail footprint, and will focus on building profitable stores with short payback periods, focusing on a small
footprint, with flexible leases in brand appropriate locations, such as in the United States, where we only have
three locations.

Our ability to accelerate global DTC growth goes hand-in-hand with our ability to directly control
distribution across the various markets in which we operate. As such, we plan to continue with our longstanding
strategy to gradually takeover distribution in key markets to support our direct-to-consumer growth strategy and
to increase control over our brand. While we have already taken over distribution in several of our critical
markets, we still have distribution agreements with third-parties in place for several markets in Europe and Asia.
Over the coming years, when it is strategically beneficial, we will look to convert certain of those distributor
markets to company owned-and-operated, which will drive long-term accretive growth.

**_Diversifying product assortment and usage occasions_**

Our five core iconic product families—the Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the Madrid and the Boston—
have, apart from the Mayari, been on the market for decades and provide us with a highly predictable and
consistent sales base. In recent years, we have successfully driven growth within these iconic product franchises
through the introduction of new materials and fabrications (e.g., shearling, vegan leather alternatives) and price
bands (e.g., launch of opening price point EVA line and luxury collaborations through 1774 segment). Going
forward, we will continue expanding these iconic product families through further design, construction, and
materials updates.

We plan to drive future, incremental growth primarily through diversification into closed-toe shoes, which
will enable us to serve different usage occasions for consumers, balance seasonality, and drive growth and
profitability through higher average selling prices. We believe we have made substantial progress against this
strategic effort in recent years, as demonstrated by the performance of the Boston silhouette. The Boston, a clog
originally launched in 1978 has enjoyed a compound annual growth rate of 13% between FY 2016 and FY 2020
as we expanded the style count and more prominently featured the silhouette in our stores and e-commerce site.

We have identified runway in other functionally driven footwear categories, such as the adventure / outdoor,
orthopedic, and professional segments. We are investing in the successful development of these products, and as
an example, we have recently formed a biomechanics team that is focused on driving new technical innovations,
such as non-slip treaded sole, solid steel toe cap, and oil, grease, and water-resistant materials. We believe that
innovations in these niche markets will enable the BIRKENSTOCK brand to reach new customers and broaden
its usage occasions, all while delivering on our legacy of quality, durability, and craftsmanship.

**_Investing in production and IT systems to enable the next decade of growth_**

Since we began manufacturing our first footbeds in the early twentieth century, we have always made our
own products. In fact, up until the early-2010s we operated primarily as a manufacturer and supplier of highquality footwear and largely relied on third-party distributors to sell our products. And though, over the years, we
have continued to grow and scale our brand, we remain deeply committed to our roots of German manufacturing
excellence.

Our vertically integrated supply chain represents a key source of competitive advantage and enables us to
uphold our high standards of craftsmanship and ethical production. To this day, our products are handcrafted by
the 3,137 skilled workers we employ in our owned production facilities in Germany. Over the past three years,
almost all of our expansion capital expenditures have been invested in enhancing our in-house production
capabilities to meet the demands of our growing business. For example, our in-house team of engineers have
developed proprietary, leading-edge automation technologies that we are in the process of implementing, and that
we expect will improve our manufacturing cost structure and further enhance the quality and consistency of our
products. For the avoidance of doubt, our automation technologies are not meant to reduce or replace our
manufacturing workforce; if anything, we will continue to invest in and scale our production capabilities in
Germany.

106


-----

Going forward, while our existing supply chain has the scale to support our growth plan, we have the
potential to iterate our production and planning approach to increasingly support our shift to DTC. To that end,
we plan to continue to strategically invest behind manufacturing innovations that will support a shift towards
demand-based production as well as increase capacity for longer-term growth.

Similarly, while we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on our owned DTC channels, we plan to
continue to invest in technology and systems to support owned channel growth and to optimize critical
operational processes as our supply chain grows larger and more complex. For example, near-term investments
may include CRM, forecasting and logistics management.

**Our History**

Our origins date back nearly two and a half centuries to 1774, when Johann Adam Birkenstock opened shop
as a cobbler in the German village of Langen-Bergheim. Johann’s craft was passed down through the
Birkenstock family over the years, and in 1896, his great-great-grandson, master cobbler Konrad Birkenstock,
had a novel idea that would change the footwear industry forever. At the time, shoes were made with flat insoles,
despite the fact that the bottom of the human foot is curved. Konrad realized that an insole that complemented the
natural curvature of the foot would be more comfortable than a flat surface, so he designed the first contoured
shoe last, a tool used in shoe-making, to help his cobblers make customized footwear for patrons.

However by the time Konrad launched his progressive new design, the rapidly industrializing footwear
industry was decimating demand for custom, handmade shoes. Undeterred, Konrad adapted his original invention
to fit the growing factory-manufactured footwear market, and began to manufacture and sell flexible orthopedic
insoles that could be inserted into mass-produced shoes. At a time when other foot supports were made of flat,
unyielding metal, Konrad’s footbed—made from a baked mixture of cork and latex to produce a light, resilient
material capable of supporting the body’s weight—was revolutionary.

In 1915, Konrad’s son, Carl Birkenstock, joined the family business. Father and son became renowned
orthopedic authorities, publishing numerous books and articles and traveling extensively throughout Europe
conducting seminars and trainings on orthopedic theory. In 1932, one of Carl’s publications, a textbook entitled
_Podiatry—The Carl Birkenstock System in which Carl expounded on his theories about the “natural gait” and_
healthy footwear, became among the best-selling podiatry textbooks of the day.

In 1964, Carl’s son, Karl Birkenstock, took his grandfather’s footbed one step further by adding a sole and a
leather strap that ran across the wearer’s toes. And thus, the first modern BIRKENSTOCK sandal, the Madrid,
was born. Originally launched as a fitness shoe, the design offered a multitude of ergonomic benefits to its
wearers—including to activate the grip reflex of the toes as one walks, exercising one’s foot and leg muscles.
The Madrid became an instant classic. Today, the Madrid remains one of our most iconic, best-selling
silhouettes, and is nearly unchanged from the first pair that was sold over 50 years ago. Since the launch of the
Madrid, we have launched many other successful silhouettes, including longstanding icons like the Arizona
(1973), the Boston (1978), and the Gizeh (1983), all of which were among the top-5 best-selling silhouettes in
2020. Today, just as in 1964, the core attributes of the BIRKENSTOCK brand remain rooted in orthopedic health
and wellbeing.

As the popularity of our sandals grew across Europe, a woman named Margot Fraser introduced the brand to
the United States. Fraser, a German-American dressmaker and designer, first discovered our sandals while on a
spa trip to Germany in 1966. The anatomically designed footwear delivered immediate relief to her painful feet,
prompting her to contact Karl Birkenstock to explore importing his family’s designs to the United States. Fraser
was given distribution rights and launched the business from her home in Northern California. Her first
customers were health food retailers, which allowed her to capitalize on the opportunity she saw to introduce the
shoes to a new subculture of young consumers who valued function and individuality over high fashion. The
doctor-approved design appealed to these wellness-conscious customers, and soon BIRKENSTOCKs were worn
coast to coast from San Francisco to Burlington, Vermont.

Over the subsequent decades, our popularity continued to grow across the United States and Europe. By the
late 1990s, the brand had expanded well beyond our original wellness-conscious consumers, appearing on
fashion runways and A-list celebrities like Kate Moss and Harrison Ford.

We expanded our geographic footprint over the next few decades, mainly through distributors, extending the
reach of our brand. In the late 2000s, we took the first steps to kickstart the next decade of growth, insourcing
distribution in the United States in 2007, and beginning a legal reorganization to consolidate the business into a

107


-----

single, global business which we completed in 2013. In 2012, for the first time in our history, we appointed
leadership from outside the Birkenstock family, with Oliver Reichert and Markus Bensberg joining as co-CEOs.
This was a pivotal point for our business, turning it from a family-run organization into a professionally managed
global business, and during the period from FY 2014 to FY 2017 our revenues grew at a compound annual
growth rate of approximately 21%.

Under our new leadership, we evolved from a family-run organization, into a powerful, global business that
has now experienced profitable, double digit growth for the last four months. During this period, management
focused on implementing a deliberate direct-to-consumer strategy, both launching our owned ecommerce
platform (BIRKENSTOCK.com) and taking over distribution in key markets. Additionally, they invested in
professionalizing the organization, creating a global sales organization and testing digital marketing tactics for
the first time. Under their leadership, our e-commerce channel has grown to comprise 28% of our overall group
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.

On February 26, 2021, L Catterton announced the acquisition of a majority stake in the BIRKENSTOCK
Group. See “Summary—The Transactions” for further details.

**Our Product Offering**

We have a large product assortment comprised of hundreds of styles of sandals and shoes. At the core of all
our footwear products lies the original BIRKENSTOCK contoured footbed, which, rooted in orthopedic theory,
encourages proper foot wellbeing, reduces pressure points, and re-emphasizes natural walking. Most of our styles
are unisex, and we offer a range of adult and kid sizes in regular / narrow and wide widths to ensure the right fit
for any foot. Nearly 75% of our revenues for FY 2020, were driven by our five core product families: the
Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the Madrid and the Boston. In order to drive continued relevance and appeal to a
range of consumers, all our silhouettes—especially within our core product families—are available in a wide
variety of colors, patterns and constructions. In addition to our core products, our large product assortment
includes products with new technical innovations, including our functionally driven footwear categories such as
the adventure / outdoor, orthopedic and professional segments, and our premium line of sandals which include
collaborations with brands such as Stüssy, Rick Owens and Valentino.

**_The Footbed_**

Master cobbler Konrad Birkenstock invented and launched the footbed in the late 1800s, which we still use
today across all of our footwear styles. The footbed includes contoured arch supports made from a baked mixture
of cork and latex to produce a light, resilient material capable of supporting the body’s weight. This insole
complements the natural curvature of the foot and encourages proper foot wellbeing, reduces pressure points, and
re-emphasizes natural walking. The below diagram illustrates how the design of the footbed focuses on each part
of the foot creating a product that enhances health and promotes wellbeing.

**_Icons_**

Our five core iconic product families—the Arizona, the Gizeh, the Mayari, the Madrid and the Boston—
have, apart from the Mayari, been on the market for decades and provide us with a highly predictable and
consistent sales base. These five silhouettes have become immediately recognizable cultural icons with a timeless
appeal, as is evidenced by the long-lasting popularity they have enjoyed, all nearly unchanged from their original
designs. We have been able to consistently grow sales in these core product families, with strong sales in
traditional leather styles, complemented by the introduction of new materials and patterns. Our five core product
families represent approximately 75% of revenues combined, while other products comprise the remaining
approximately 25%.

_Note: Core SKUs listed above include Classic Adults Leather, Classic Adults Textile and Active Adults EVA; all other product categories_

_The Arizona_

Our best-selling silhouette is The Arizona. Introduced in 1973, it has millions of dedicated fans around the
world. The Arizona is immediately recognizable with several distinctive features of BIRKENSTOCK sandals:
the legendary contoured footbed, the individually adjustable straps to create a custom-like-fit, and the trademark
metal pin buckles etched with the signature BIRKENSTOCK logo.

**_Materials and Materials Innovation_**

To drive continued relevance and appeal to a range of consumers, all our silhouettes—especially within our
core product families—are available in a wide variety of colors, patterns and constructions. In recent years, we
have successfully driven growth within our core product families by adding styles with different materials and
constructions. This low risk strategy has driven high returns by creating newness and expanding our products to a
broader customer base while retaining the classic silhouettes that are at the heart of the BIRKENSTOCK brand.
For example, many of our classic products that are available in leather are now also available in our trademarked
vegan leather alternative, Birko-Flor[®], expanding their reach to a larger customer segment.

We also use materials innovation to expand usage occasions. For instance, we offer a range of products in
shearling, a material that has turned the Arizona into a popular winter shoe. We also offer a range of waterproof
shoes and sandals made entirely out of EVA, a skin-friendly, non-toxic synthetic compound. Many of our
popular classic sandals, such as the Arizona and the Gizeh, are available in EVA in a broad array of colors. Our
EVA products are also strategically priced at an entry-level price point to introduce new consumers to our brand.
Additionally, EVA is not only waterproof, but also resistant to heat, acid, oil and grease making it an ideal
material for our professional products.

**_PINNACLE / 1774_**

Our line of premium sandals, named 1774 in an homage to BIRKENSTOCK’s rich heritage, is comprised of
a curated assortment including our own designs as well as collaborations. For us, it is important that
collaborations not only align with our brand values but also push the brand forward through infusing new
creative ideas. Thus, we work selectively with brands—many with creative directors who are Birkenstock fans
themselves—that we believe will craft original products that enhance the standing of our brand. Through our
1774 line, we have conceived of and launched multiple fashion collaborations with brands as diverse as Stüssy,
Rick Owens and Valentino. These collaborations, profitable in and of themselves, also serve as differentiated
marketing vehicles, enabling us to create a “halo” around BIRKENSTOCK, and to amplify our brand reach to
new consumers in a cost-effective manner. Collaborations typically feature one or more re-worked “Icons” in
collaboration with notable designers or artists, leveraging third-party creativity and recognition while
highlighting BIRKENSTOCK’s heritage and values. While collaborations represent a very small proportion of
total units sold (less than 1% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020), they play an important role in
building brand equity and a sense of newness and excitement within the brand.

**_Product Roadmap_**

Through our strategic focus on entering and expanding certain product categories, including closed-toe
shoes, professional/orthopedic, kids, and adventure, we continue to balance seasonality, add new usage occasions
and reach new segments of the market. In recent years, we have specifically focused on growing our closed-toe
shoe assortment, which represented approximately 4% of our revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020. The closed-toe segment houses significant growth potential given higher average selling
prices and broader applicability across different seasons and usage occasions. We also continue to invest in the
orthopedic heritage of our brand, including recently forming a biomechanics team that is focused on driving new
technical innovations. In particular, we see significant runway in functionally driven footwear categories such as
the adventure / outdoor, orthopedic and professional segments. We believe the opportunities in these categories
are highly complementary to our current business. As we continue to broaden our appeal to new consumers and
introduce new categories, we remain true to our history of timeless, durable and functional footwear with an
emphasis on sustainability and health & wellness.

**Content and Collaborations**

We are extremely proud of our distinctive and rich brand history, which we have carefully leveraged into a
highly successful marketing strategy. Our approach has also evolved in recent years in line with the growth of
our DTC channels to support the brand experience our consumers seek, particularly in our owned e-commerce
and retail channels. We have an in-house production team that creates content to promote our brand, such as the
the BIRKENSTOCK series of short films, or “BIRKENSTORIES,” which in 2019 earned the Art Directors Club
award. BIRKENSTORIES show the profiles of wearers of BIRKENSTOCK sandals around the world who are
fans of our products.

In the summer of 2017, we launched our first global brand advertising with a product focused campaign shot
by world-renowned photographer, Dan Tobin Smith. At the end of 2017, we introduced the BIRKENSTOCK

110


-----

BOX, a mobile pop-up store in a sea freight container, which is designed as a travelling retail experiment that
involves architects, artists, local retail partners and consumers in several cities. The BIRKENSTOCK BOX was
designed to attract customers and brand fans with a selected range of limited edition products, while at the same
time building a close relationship with top retail partners and fashion designers. The tour is documented on social
media and the special collections or limited edition products can be bought on our website.

Our digital marketing strategy focuses on, among other things, ensuring brand integrity, carefully choosing
our presence on selected online marketplaces and social media accounts (including Facebook, Pinterest and
Instagram, where we have official brand accounts), and maintaining consistency in imagery and content (visual
and editorial) across markets and media. We advertise our products through our online magazine featuring guest
authors, online tutorials (including in YouTube), opt-in newsletters and events.

In addition, we engage in collaborations with well-known brands, such as Stüssy, Rick Owens, Random
Identities, 032c, Monocle and Valentino, which serve as differentiated marketing vehicles, enabling us to
increase our brand reach to new consumers in a cost-effective manner. Our creative partnerships have also
included Tico Torres, the Bon Jovi band drummer, with whom we designed the RockStarBaby line, and the
Königliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Berlin (the Royal Porcelain Manufactory Berlin) (“KPM”), with whom we
launched a limited edition style in May 2018 of the Arizona and Gizeh with exclusive porcelain ornaments from
KPM. We believe our distinctive and successful use of collaborations, along with organic, unpaid support from
celebrities such as Kendall Jenner, Heidi Klum, Leonardo DiCaprio, Gigi Hadid and Jason Momoa, have
generated significant earned media.

**Operational Structure**

Headquartered in Neustadt, Germany, we operate a regional business model from four regional hubs:
Americas, Europe, ASPA and MEAI. We have implemented a balanced global/local structure with direction
provided centrally and local leaders responsible for trading and implementation, as well as a strong crossfunctional set-up with appropriate straight and dotted reporting lines to ensure adequate information flow and
collaboration. Several group functions have been allocated to a Shared Service Center (“SSC”) that provides
central operating and administrative support services to all production sites and regional hubs, including logistic
services, centralized sale and distribution and product and marketing support services, administrative services
such as general administration, human resources, finance, controlling, tax, legal, information technology (“IT”)
and planning and operations, and top management functions in Germany.

**_Sales Channels_**

We distribute our products through three sales channels—e-commerce, wholesale and retail—in almost
100 countries. Historically, we have operated primarily as a manufacturer and supplier of high-quality footwear,
relying primarily on third-party distributors to market, sell, and expand the reach of the brand into new territories.
However, today, as a result of our strategy to increase ownership of our distribution channels, our wholesale
business is comprised of a combination of direct wholesale customers as well as legacy third-party distributors.

Since the early 2010s, we have focused on further vertically integrating our distribution functions into our
corporate organization to enable us greater control over the brand and distribution, further shifting distribution
into our owned channels. We have seen meaningful recent acceleration in our DTC owned e-commerce and retail
channels, which have expanded from 18% of revenues in FY 2018 to 32% of revenues in the twelve months
ended December 31, 2020. We believe that DTC—in particular, our owned e-commerce channel—will generate
an increasing portion of our sales and profits going forward.

_E-commerce_

In line with our direct-to-consumer distribution strategy, our e-commerce sales channel has become a key
focus for our future growth. Our e-commerce channel is comprised of our global owned online stores
(BIRKENSTOCK.com). We also own country-code and city-code domain registrations in more than
100 locations. We generated 11%, 13.5%, 14%, 25% and 28% of our revenues in the e-commerce channel in FY
2017, FY 2018, FY 2019, FY 2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively,
demonstrating the success or our strategy to increase DTC penetration. Our e-commerce channel has grown at a
47% compounded annual growth rate between FY 2018 and FY 2020. The online store in Europe is centrally
operated by Birkenstock Digital GmbH. The online stores for our other regional hubs are operated by the local
entities and warehousing and fulfilment is performed by our logistics partners.

111


-----

Our e-commerce channel enables us to offer the broadest product assortment as well as a direct channel for
communication with our consumers. E-commerce also has the added financial benefit of driving strong profit
margins and enhancing the overall profitability of our overall business.

_Retail_

Our retail channel is comprised of our own retail stores, representing a small, but complementary, segment
of our direct-to-consumer business. We generated 4%, 4.5%, 5%, 5% and 4% of our revenues in the retail
channel in FY 2017, FY 2018, FY 2019, FY 2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020,
respectively. Most of our 52 retail locations are located in Germany, where we operate a network of 35 locations
as of November 2020.

While retail represents an important channel where consumers engage physically with our brand and products,
we remain extremely disciplined with our approach to managing our retail locations and highly selective with
respect to profitability and expected paybacks. We have recently embarked on a strategy of opening flagship retail
locations, such as Soho and Brooklyn in New York City, Venice Beach in California and Soho in London. Going
forward, we may consider strategic additions to our retail footprint, and will focus on building profitable stores with
short payback periods, focusing on a small footprint, with relatively short-term flexible leases (including rental
payments based on percentage of sales, early tenant-only break clauses and maximizing landlord capital
contributions) in brand appropriate locations, such as the United States, where we only have three locations.

_Wholesale_

Our wholesale channel, which spans our direct business with retail partners, as well as our relationships with
distribution partners in certain markets, plays an important role in providing physical distribution and increasing
our brand awareness globally. We generated 85%, 82%, 80%, 70% and 68% of our revenues in the wholesale
channel in FY 2017, FY 2018, FY 2019, FY 2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020,
respectively. The decrease in the proportion of our wholesale revenues has been as a result of our deliberate
strategy of increasing direct-to-customer penetration.

Our wholesale channel provides physical distribution via third parties in locations or markets where
wholesale presents a better route-to-market, via large, established third-party store networks, than retail and it
also plays a significant role in increasing brand awareness globally, in particular in new markets. For our
wholesale partners, we represent an important, “must carry” brand within the footwear category given the
strength of our brand name and the customers that we attract. As a result, we generate significantly more demand
from existing and prospective new wholesale customers than we can supply, putting us in an enviable position
where we can create scarcity, control our brand and limit any discounting activity. This has enabled us to focus
only on deepening our relationships with best-in-class retailers who strengthen our brand image and who extend
our reach to new and attractive customer demographics. Finally, we also proudly work with—and have grown
our business with—an extensive network of independent footwear stores, a channel that reaches an
oft-underserved customer base and speaks to the heritage of our brand.

Beginning with the distribution takeover of the U.S. market in 2007 and accelerating after the appointment
of our first co-CEOs from outside the Birkenstock family in 2012, we have focused on further vertically
integrating our distribution into our corporate organization to enable us greater control over our brand and
distribution. Directly controlling distribution globally will be a critical enabler of our ongoing DTC shift. While
own distribution has been part of our model since the beginning, some more recent distribution takeovers
include:

**Year** **Market** **Year** **Market**

2007 United States 2015 Poland
2015 Spain 2019 Switzerland
2017 United Kingdom 2019 Canada
2016 Denmark 2020 India

**_Regional Hubs_**

We coordinate our distribution of our products through our four regional hubs: Americas, Europe, ASPA
and MEAI.

112


-----

_Americas_

The Americas includes, among others, the United States, Brazil, Canada and Mexico. We generated 32%,
40%, 44%, 47% and 49% of our revenues in the Americas in FY 2017, FY 2018, FY 2019, FY 2020 and the
twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively.

The United States is our largest and most important market in the Americas. Following our distribution
takeover in 2007 and the successful implementation our DTC-focused strategy, our revenues in the U.S. have
grown from approximately $42 million in FY 2012 to $349 million in FY 2020. We launched our e-commerce
channel in 2017, which has grown at an average of 47% compounded annual growth rate between FY 2018 and
FY 2020. Our DTC channels represented 34% of our Americas revenues for FY 2020. We expect that
e-commerce revenues in the United States will be continue to a major driver of future growth. To complement
our e-commerce channel, we recently opened three flagship retail location: in Soho, New York City in 2018,
Venice Beach, California in 2019 and Brooklyn, New York City in 2021. We intend to use this strategy and our
experience gained from successfully implementing a DTC-focused strategy in the United States as a playbook to
drive growth in our other hubs. For example, we recently took over the distribution in Canada in 2020 and is
already showing positive results.

_Europe_

Europe includes, among others, our key markets of Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands. We generated 48%, 45%, 42%, 41% and 41% of our revenues in Europe in FY 2017, FY 2018, FY
2019, FY 2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively.

Our home country, Germany, accounts for the largest percentage of our revenue in Europe across all three
distribution channels. The German footwear market is our oldest market, with the majority of our own retail
stores located in Germany. The wholesale channel accounts for the highest revenue share in Germany, although
we have successfully driven outsized growth in the e-commerce channel as a result of our focus on DTC.

In recent years, we have focused on further vertically integrating our distribution into our corporate
organization to enable us greater control over the brand and our margins, including through distribution takeovers
in Spain, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Switzerland. In addition, we are currently in the process of a
distribution take-over in other key European markets. Our DTC channel accounted for 31% of our revenues in
Europe for FY 2020.

_Rest of World—ASPA & MEAI_

The ASPA hub covers Asia, the South Pacific and Australia. We generated 16%, 13%, 12%, 10% and 8% of
our revenues in ASPA in FY 2017, FY 2018, FY 2019, FY 2020 and the twelve months ended December 31,
2020, respectively. Our largest markets in ASPA include Japan, Australia, and South Korea collectively
representing approximately 62% of ASPA’s revenue in FY 2020 and 59% for the twelve months ended
December 30, 2020.

MEAI is our newest hub formed in 2018 and covers certain growth markets the Middle East, Africa and
India. We generated 3%, 2%, 2%, 2% and 2% of our revenues in MEAI in FY 2017, FY 2018, FY 2019, FY
2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively. Our key markets in MEAI include United
Arab Emirates and India. Following the entry into the Indian market at the beginning of FY 2020, we also opened
our first online store in MEAI in India.

Our business is relatively nascent in the ASPA and MEAI hubs, and many of our operations are partner-led.
We believe there is potential for significant growth in these regions.

**Supply Chain**

**_Sustainability_**

For us, sustainability is not a matter of retrofitting our brand or labelling ourselves as “green” just to fit a
consumer trend but is instead a way of thinking that has been deeply embedded in our ethos for decades. We
maintain strict controls over our entire supply chain—from carefully selecting high quality, sustainable materials
from our largely European supply base, including cork, natural latex, jute, leather, wool felt, copper and brass, to
hand-finishing our products in our five owned manufacturing facilities across central Germany—and a relentless
focus on creating well-made, functional, and durable products. The durability of our products makes them

113


-----

inherently sustainable. Environmental protection has long been of paramount importance at BIRKENSTOCK.
We constantly work to improve production processes, products, packaging and logistics.

**_Production_**

We produce nearly all our products in Germany through our five owned manufacturing facilities as show on
the map below. By fully controlling the production process, we know where and how our products are made,
enabling us to guarantee a clean and ethical supply chain.

Approximately 91% of our revenues for FY 2020 resulted from products produced in our own facilities.
Portions of our closed shoes, such as clogs, boots, and sneakers, are made in workshops in Portugal that are
operated by an external partner. Our production sites maintain operational relationships with each other as each
site is responsible for producing certain parts necessary for final assembly of our products.

Our production sites in Görlitz and Strödt, and the branch in Portugal that coordinates our closed-toe shoe
production with our external partner, are responsible for the final assembly of shoes in addition to other
production processes, such as buckles processing in Strödt, and EVA beach shoes production in Strödt and
Görlitz. In addition, Steinau Ürzell is primarily dedicated to the production of footbed.

Our production sites in Görlitz, Bernstadt and Markersdorf were established between 1991 and 2009 to meet
increasing volume demand. These locations were planned to cover nearly the entire chin of manufacturing steps
and final assembly, if necessary, as a backup to the production and assembly at Strödt as part of our production
risk management. These locations are supported by a favorable workforce due to the sites’ proximity to Poland
and the Czech Republic.

Our in-house team of engineers have developed propriety, leading-edge automation technologies that we are
in the process of implementing, and that we expect will improve our manufacturing cost structure and further
enhance the quality and consistency of our products. These modernizations will streamline the production
process and support our ability to control production costs. Two production lines dedicated to the final assembly
of sandals in the Strödt production facility have been fully automated, and we expect to add two further
automated productions lines by the end of FY 2021, which will be a game-changer for a company going forward.
We plan to make further modernizations to our productions facilities and are currently evaluating various
initiatives that we believe will further support profitable growth. For the avoidance of doubt, our automation
technologies are not meant to reduce or replace our manufacturing workforce; if anything, we will continue to
invest in and scale our production capabilities in Germany.

**_Raw Materials_**

We utilize sustainable raw materials in the production of our shoes. All of our footbeds are made with
natural materials, such as cork, latex and the finest jute ensuring long-lasting high quality products for our

114


-----

customers. In fact, in a recent survey carried out by a third party service provider, approximately 65% of
consumers state that they intend to buy more high-quality items that last longer. We use only premium quality
cork to provide the orthopedic contours feet need for maximum comfort. Our uppers are made of both natural
materials and synthetic materials including high-quality leathers (such as smooth leather, embossed leather,
natural/oiled leather, waxy leather, metallic leather, patent leather, nubuck leather and suede), carefully selected
textiles (such as linen, canvas and wool felt), trademarked leather alternatives (such as Birko-Flor[®], Birkibuc[®]
and Birko-Felt[®]) and synthetic fabrics and other materials (such as microfiber, polyurethane and EVA).

We also offer products in our range of trademarked leather alternatives. Birko-Flor[®] is our trademarked
synthetic leather, also available in a patent version, Birkibuc[®] is our trademarked synthetic nubuck and BirkoFelt[®] is our trademarked synthetic felt. We recently formed a biomechanics team focused on driving new
technical innovations, such as polyurethane-based materials. We produce our materials responsibly and monitor
them to ensure they are kind to the skin.

_Sustainable, Natural Cork_

One of our most important raw materials is cork, a naturally lightweight, breathable, and insulating material.
Cork is a highly versatile natural material that can be harvested multiple times without harming the tree. The cork
is obtained from the bark layer of the cork oak and is reproduced and can therefore be harvested again and again
without harming the tree. A single tree can provide 100 to 200 kilograms of cork during its life. We source 100%
of our cork—specifically, the waste byproduct of cork used to manufacture high-quality wine stoppers—from
small, family-held farms in Portugal.

_Water-based, Environmentally Friendly Adhesives_

Almost all of the adhesives we use are water-based and environmentally friendly. We were one of the first
footwear manufacturers in the world to use water-soluble and solvent-free adhesives almost exclusively in its
production processes. In recent years, we have successfully worked to considerably reduce the proportion of
adhesives that contain solvents.

Natural latex serves as a primary binding agent in the production of the footbed. Like cork, natural latex is
also a renewable resource. Natural latex is obtained from the resin of rubber trees. The latex milk that is emitted
from the trees is collected in small buckets. This process does not occur for the first time until the trees have
matured to six years old at which point, a rubber tree will provide approximately 80 grams of latex every day for
25 years. Unlike synthetic latex, which is made from crude oil, natural latex is made using less energy and is free
from solvents or CFCs. Natural latex also has beneficial natural properties, such as a high elasticity-point and
breathability.

_Renewable Textile Fibers_

Jute provides additional stabilization to the cork and latex core of the original BIRKENSTOCK footbed.
Jute, like cork, is a renewable resource. The annual plant is generally grown in perpetually humid tropical
regions. The bushes grow to 15 to 20 centimeters before they are harvested after about four months. Before the
fibers can be spun, the plant’s textile fibers are first roasted, peeled, combed and cleaned. The natural fibers are
then softened. During the production of the footbeds, two layers of jute fiber braids are utilized to stabilize the
top side and underside.

**_Sourcing and Suppliers_**

All of our high-quality supplies are sourced in accordance with our established Code of Conduct. We have
strict procurement guidelines and all products must comply with our requirements. Sourcing processes must be
regulated and in line with our standards and we have quality assurance agreements with all strategic partners. At
our in-house laboratory in Bernstadt, Germany, the materials we procure are tested for quality and consistency
before use. We take a multi-supplier sourcing approach regarding the supply of the materials (such as buckles,
cork and leather), tools and services required for the production of our products and no single supplier accounted
for more than 11% of supply costs in FY 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when Northern Italy was
severely impacted, our other suppliers increased production thereby alleviating any supply disruption, which is
testament to our robust and multi-sourcing supplier strategy. In addition, our breadth of suppliers allows us
increased control of our cost base as demonstrated by the reduction in our Material Unit Costs from €8.0 in FY
2018 to €6.7 FY 2020, representing a decrease of approximately 16%.

115


-----

We have long-standing relationships with many of our suppliers. Our top 14 suppliers, approximately 60%
of supply costs of raw materials, semi-finished goods, auxiliary and packing for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020, are based in Europe, with one in Turkey. As a result, we have visibility over a majority of
our supplier base and we maintain strict controls, enabling us to maintain a clean and ethical supply chain. We
typically enter into framework agreements and terms and conditions with our suppliers, based on our template
agreement. Our purchasing activities are ultimately overseen by our Chief Procurement Officer.

**_Code of Conduct_**

We are a global shoe manufacturer and are aware of our responsibility to our customers and our employees.
We have set strict ethical and social rules for ourselves that guide us in our business. We expect our suppliers to
act according to the same ethical principles. For this reason, we have developed a code of conduct for suppliers
(the “Code of Conduct”). The Code of Conduct is based largely on the principles of the Global Compact issued
by the United Nations and the International Labor Organization. It is binding for all of our suppliers and
employees.

The Code of Conduct covers topics related to compliance with laws, prohibition of corruption and bribery,
respect for the basic rights of employees, prohibition of child labor, health and safety of employees,
environmental protection and supply chain. The Code of Conduct establishes and recognizes social and
environmental minimum standards that each supplier must adhere to. By having suppliers sign this document, we
ensure that the Code of Conduct is implemented in its “supplier qualification process.” In addition, the Code of
Conduct is included as a mandatory component of all new and extended supplier agreements to ensure that our
suppliers will consistently abide by these high standards and that we remain competitive on a long-term basis.
We regularly review and update the Code of Conduct, and we have a planned up to address animal welfare
concerns.

**Logistics**

We and our external partners operate logistics centers in Germany and we operate further warehouses
globally through external partners to supply the activities of our regional hubs. Distribution center activities
include receiving finished goods from our manufactories, inspecting those products (including returns), and
shipping them to our customers and to our own stores. We operate our own logistics centers in Germany. Our
main central warehouse and distribution center for pallets and manual single-order picking is located in
Vettelschoß and we operated our own internal warehouse in Asbach for peak volumes. In addition, we have three
additional centers in Germany operated by external partners, including Arvato and Rhenus SE & Co. KG.

We also operate warehouses outside of Germany to supply the activities of our other regional hubs. The
Americas is served by three warehouses. The largest of these warehouses is located in the United States and
operated by UPS. It supplies all of our U.S. wholesalers and the e-commerce channel and retail stores in the
United States. The warehouse in Canada is also operated by UPS and supplies both of our wholesale and online
operations in Canada. The warehouse in Brazil supplies our operations in South America. The warehouses in
China and Japan supply our wholesale channels and our online operations in ASPA.

**IT Systems**

We have three centralized internal IT teams: Americas IT (based in California), European IT (based in
Germany) and Global eCommerce Services (based in New York). Our Digital Team and IT management meet on
a regular basis to discuss and prioritize strategic technology initiatives as business strategy is the primary driver
of all of our IT initiatives. We rely on third parties, primarily Bechtel and Intelligence, to host and support key
systems and network infrastructure for all our locations, which augments our internal IT function.

We have adopted a “cloud first” approach and as a result we are actively working to migrate remaining
systems in existing data centers located in our sites at Vettelschoß, Strödt, Bernstadt, Gorlitz, Steinau into
Bechtel’s primary centralized data center in Frankfurt. Bechtel provides a secondary data center for redundancy
and disaster recovery. We have recently invested in certain IT programs. For instance, we began using an
SAP-based purchasing function in FY 2018 that allows us to place orders more systematically, resulting in more
precise allocation of purchases to material categories, thus enabling us to react to and partially mitigate any
adverse effects resulting from increases in costs. During FY 2019, we improved the transparency of our
accounting by refining the classification of certain line items in the balance sheet and the income statement
through use of enterprise resource planning software. We plan to continue to invest in technology and systems to
support owned channel growth and to optimize critical operational processes as our supply chain grows larger

116

and more complex. For example, near-term investments may include customer relationship management
(“CRM”), forecasting and logistics management.

We are cybersecurity focused and regularly monitor our cybersecurity software and needs. We also train
employees on cybersecurity breaches. Privacy and data protection are a priority. Our Chief Privacy Officer
(“CPO”) has responsibility for privacy matters. We also have local data protection officers and assign a
supporting network of privacy coordinators across departments to support our CPO. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Business—We are subject to various regulations governing the use and processing of personal_
_data, and any failure to protect confidential information could harm our reputation and expose us to litigation.”_

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2020, we employed 3,075 full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employees in Germany and
approximately 160 FTE employees in the United States. In addition to our FTE employees, we also employed
approximately 1,169 agency workers (Leiharbeitnehmer) in Germany, primarily at our production sites.

We have five works councils established at certain of our sites in Germany, but we do not have a company
works council (Gesamtbetriebsrat) nor a group’s works council (Konzernbetriebsrat). Works council agreements
have been concluded with the respective works councils covering the following topics, among others: access
control to sites and bag inspection, vacation days, special leave, short-time work, data protection regulations,
work on Saturdays, working time accounts and implementation and use of IT systems. Collective bargaining
agreements are only in place at Birkenstock Productions Hessen GmbH on the basis of company collective
bargaining agreements (Firmentarifverträge). None of our employees in the United States are represented by a
union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

We believe that our relationship with our employees is good and do not currently foresee a shortage in the
number of qualified personnel needed to operate our business. To date, other than the temporary closures due to
restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not experienced a labor-related work
stoppage in the past three years. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We are dependent on good
_relationships with our employees and employee representative bodies and stakeholders.”_

**Intellectual Property**

We own a large portfolio of international intellectual property (“IP”) rights. The BIRKENSTOCK brand is
our most material IP asset. We manage our IP portfolio worldwide in Germany. All material IP-development and
the registration process for new IP originates in Germany. Over the last two years, we have increased our focus
on educating employees about the value of our brand and designs portfolio and invested additional resources into
IP rights enforcement against third party infringers.

We established trademark rights in the BIRKENSTOCK brand in more than 90 countries worldwide. Our
trademark registrations cover the international class of goods for footwear and in most jurisdictions, the class of
goods covering orthopedic articles, including in key markets such as the European Union (including Germany),
the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, China (Chinese characters) and South Korea, and have pending
applications in certain additional jurisdictions. We also own registrations for our Papillio and Betula brands and
names of shoe styles, including Birk, Birki, Birko-Flor, Boston, Gizeh, Madrid, and the footprint logo.

In addition, when possible, we seek patent protection for protectable elements of our shoe products,
primarily as design patents, as part of our overall global rights enforcement strategy. We maintain a large design
portfolio.

We own more than 860 domain names, including our primary domain name BIRKENSTOCK.com. We also
own country-code and city-code domain registrations in more than 100 locations, including Germany (.de),
France (.fr), the United Kingdom (.co.uk) and Spain (.es). In addition, in order to strengthen domain presence and
protect brands from domain name squatters, we regularly register iterations of our material domains. We also
operate social media accounts (including on Facebook and Instagram) and have various active websites.

We strictly enforce against any products and fake shops that might be infringing our IP rights, including
seizure measures, taking legal action where necessary and working with local jurisdictions to stop any
counterfeiting operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—If we are unable to adequately
_protect, maintain and enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, or if we infringe the_
_intellectual property rights of third parties, our business would be materially adversely affected.”_

**Regulatory Matters**

We are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, covering a wide variety
of areas affecting general consumer protection and product safety, including health and safety, environmental,
product quality and safety, competition, data protection and privacy, export and import controls, anti-corruption
legislation, trade sanctions and labor laws. Generally, each region is primarily responsible for compliance with
various local regulatory regimes applicable within its jurisdiction and there are regional lawyers in place to
support. We also have a central legal team that is primarily responsible for overseeing compliance with laws and
regulations at Group-level, as well as supporting the regional teams across jurisdictions vis-à-vis compliance
with the regulatory regimes. While the Group does not operate in a heavily regulated industry, the legal team is
well-staffed and engaged to deal with risks as they arise. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—
_Compliance with existing laws and regulations or changes in any such laws and regulations could affect our_
_business.”_

**Material Agreements**

We enter into a broad array of distribution, customer, supplier and other third party agreements, and in
particular, we have agreements with a wide range of distributors in our various markets. Given the nature of our
business, while these agreements are important to our business, they are not material on an individual basis and,
as part of our direct-to-consumer strategy, we have been gradually and selectively terminating certain agreements
as part of our distribution takeovers. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our sales and
_distribution channels are dependent on cooperation with third parties.”_

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance covering, among others, property damage, business interruption, stock and
equipment breakdown, product liability, employer’s liability, theft and cyber, transported goods, and directors’
and officers’ liability. We believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with industry practice and is
sufficient for the risks that would normally be associated with our operations, but we cannot guarantee that we
could not be adversely affected by damage or accidents despite possessing said insurance coverage. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient and insurance premiums_
_may increase.”_

**Litigation**

We are subject to litigation from time to time, in the ordinary course of business. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to our Business—We are subject to the risk of litigation and other claims.” We are not currently involved_
in any legal proceedings which, either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse
impact effect on our business or financial position. In April 2021, a former distribution partner of
BIRKENSTOCK in France filed a lawsuit against BIRKENSTOCK claiming, among other things, damages as a
result of reduced discounts, fewer product deliveries and the termination of our business relationship in
connection with our taking over of distribution in the French market. While we are still assessing the merits and
the nominal value of the claims could be considered significant, we believe on the basis of advice from counsel
that they will not result in any material liability. However, the outcome of legal proceedings can be extremely
difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances in this regard.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we enter into related party transactions with our
shareholders, companies within the Group, key management personnel and associates. We believe that all
transactions with such parties are negotiated and executed on an arm’s-length basis and that the terms of these
transactions are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated third-parties.

In addition, we will engage in various financing transactions with our new shareholders and enter into new
related party transactions in connection with the Transactions. See “The Transactions.”

**Management Equity Participation Program**

Following the closing of the Acquisition, the Sponsor intends to establish the structure for a management
equity participation program to which certain managers of the Group will be able to subscribe to after the
Acquisition Closing Date. The subscribing managers will be invested through a vehicle in the form of a German
limited partnership (GmbH &Co KG) which will hold securities in Midco and will be expected to enter into
certain customary documentation. Pursuant to such management participation program, the subscribing managers
will indirectly hold a percentage of the issued ordinary shares in Midco in an amount to be agreed.

120


-----

**PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS**

German Newco is a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of Germany. All of the limited
partner interests in German Newco are held by Lux SPV. The general partner of German Newco is Birkenstock
Holding Verwaltungs UG (haftungsbeschränkt), a limited liability company (Unternehmergesellschaft)
organized under the laws of Germany, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lux SPV. Prior to Acquisition Closing
Date, the general partnership interest in German Newco will be transferred from Birkenstock Holding
Verwaltungs UG (haftungsbeschränkt) to Birkenstock Administration B.V., a limited liability company under the
laws of The Netherlands, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lux SPV. Following the completion of the Acquisition,
German Newco will own the Target Business.

Lux SPV is a société à responsabilité limitée incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and a whollyowned subsidiary of the Issuer. The Issuer is a société à responsabilité limitée incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg and an indirect subsidiary of Midco, a société à responsabilité limitée incorporated under the laws
of Luxembourg. Funds affiliated with the Sponsor directly or indirectly own 100% of the equity interests in
Midco. In addition, the Sponsor intends to establish the structure for a management equity participation program
at Midco following the Acquisition Closing Date. Pursuant to such management participation program, the
subscribing managers will indirectly hold a percentage of the issued ordinary shares in Midco in an amount to be
agreed. Following the Acquisition Closing Date, we expect that the Sponsor, Financière Agache (a holding
company controlled by Agache, the Arnault family holding company and the controlling shareholder of LVMH),
and any co-investors will hold approximately 85% of the ordinary shares in Midco, CBB will hold approximately
10% of the ordinary shares in Midco and management will indirectly hold up to 5% of the ordinary shares in
Midco. The foregoing shareholding percentages are indicative and may be subject to variations.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

**Senior Term Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the financing of the Acquisition, BK LC Lux SPV S.a` r.l. (the “Company”) will enter
into a Senior Term Facilities Agreement with, among others, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Credit Suisse Loan
Funding LLC, Credit Suisse (Deutschland) Aktiengesellschaft, Citibank, N.A. London Branch, HSBC Securities
(USA) Inc., Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank Deutschland,
Niederlassung einer französischen Société Anonyme as mandated lead arrangers, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA
as agent and security agent (“Senior Term Facilities Agreement”).

The Senior Term Facilities Agreement provides for senior term loan facilities in principal amounts of
€325,000,000 (the “EUR TLB Facility”) and the USD equivalent of €750,000,000 (the “USD TLB Facility” and
together with EUR TLB Facility, the “Senior Term Facilities”).

Incremental facilities may also be established under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement from time to time
(including by way of an increase to any existing facilities or the establishment of new facilities) (the
“Incremental Senior Term Facilities” and, together with the Senior Term Facilities, the “Senior Credit
Facilities”).

**_Borrowers, Currencies and utilizations_**

The Senior Term Facilities may be utilized by certain restricted subsidiaries of the Company which enter
into the Senior Term Facilities Agreement as borrowers of such facilities or otherwise accede to the Senior Term
Facilities Agreement as additional borrowers of such facilities (the “Senior Term Facilities Borrowers”).

The EUR TLB Facility will be utilized in EUR and the USD TLB Facility will be utilized in USD.

**_Purpose_**

All amounts borrowed under Senior Term Facilities shall be applied directly or indirectly, in or towards
(including by way of on-lending to, or investment in, any other member of the Senior Secured Group (as defined
below) or the BIRKENSTOCK Group) (directly or indirectly): (i) financing or refinancing consideration paid or
payable in connection with the Acquisition (including any purchase price adjustments); (ii) the payment of
acquisition costs and all other fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction; (iii)
refinancing or otherwise discharging existing indebtedness of the BIRKENSTOCK Group; (iv) financing any
other payments identified in or for any other purpose contemplated by the funds flow statement or the tax
structure memorandum or otherwise arising in connection with the Transaction; (v) financing other related
amounts, including fees, costs and expenses; and/or (vi) to the extent not applied for a purpose set out in
sub-paragraphs (i) to (v) above, financing or refinancing the general corporate purposes and/or working capital
requirements of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (the “Senior Secured Group”) (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, as cash over-funding).

**_Availability_**

The Senior Term Facilities will be available to be utilized from (and including) the date of the Senior Term
Facilities Agreement to (and including) the earliest to occur of (i) the date falling twenty Business Days after the
longstop date under the Acquisition Agreement; (ii) 27 September 2021; (iii) the date falling five Business Days
after (x) the first utilisation of the Senior Term Facilities has been made to complete the Acquisition; and (y) the
Acquisition Closing Date has occurred (together, the “Closing Date”); and (iv) the date on which the Company
(or any of its Affiliate) determines and notifies the agent under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement that the
Acquisition Agreement has been validly and conclusively terminated prior to the longstop date under the
Acquisition Agreement, or such later date as agreed by the arrangers (each acting reasonably and in good faith).

Utilizations of the Senior Term Facilities are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under (x) the USD TLB Facility will bear interest at rates per annum equal to LIBOR; and (y) the
EUR TLB Facility will bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable
margin, which in each case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of consolidated
senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Term Facilities
Agreement) (the “Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio”).

122


-----

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under EUR
TLB Facility. If LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR shall be deemed to be 0.50% in respect of loans made under the
USD TLB Facility.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% per annum on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under EUR TLB Facility will be repaid in full on the date that is seven years from the
Closing Date.

The loans made under USD TLB Facility will be repaid in instalments by repaying on each Quarter Date
(commencing, with respect to each Loan made under the USD TLB Facility, with the last day of the first full
Financial Quarter ending after the Closing Date) an amount which reduces the principal amount of such loans
drawn during the availability period by 0.25 per cent of their outstanding principal amount from time to time,
with the balance to be repaid in full on the date that is seven years from the Closing Date.

**_Voluntary and Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Term Facilities Agreement will permit voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to de minimis
amounts) and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

   - from certain net cash proceeds received by the Senior Secured Group from certain asset disposals, to
the extent not otherwise applied for a permitted purpose and required to be applied in prepayment of
the Senior Credit Facilities and subject to a de minimis amount and other customary carve outs
substantially similar to the Notes as described in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”; and

   - unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, for each
financial year (commencing with the first full financial year following the Closing Date), a percentage
of excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum threshold amount (subject to
certain adjustments based on anticipated debt service, distributions to be paid to minority shareholders
and certain other expenses), which percentage decreases as the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
decreases (an “Excess Cash Flow Prepayment”).

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior Term Facilities Agreement which
follows terms substantially similar to the Notes as described in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”),
each lender and issuing bank shall be entitled to require prepayment of outstanding amounts and cancellation of
its commitments within a prescribed time period. A Change of Control shall include:

   - any person or group (other than one or more permitted holders) becoming the beneficial owner of more
than 50% of the voting power of the Company other than in connection with a transaction or series of
transactions in which the Company shall become the wholly owned subsidiary of a Parent Entity (as
defined in the Senior Term Facilities Agreement) subject to certain conditions;

   - the Issuer ceasing to directly own 100% of the total issued share capital of the Company (or in each
case any successor entity as a result of certain mergers permitted under the Senior Term Facilities
Agreement); or

   - on a disposal of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Group taken as a whole to a
person other than a restricted subsidiary or one or more permitted holders.

The Company may prepay any other indebtedness of the Senior Secured Group which is permitted
(including, junior or junior secured indebtedness) in priority if such prepayment would comply with the restricted
payments covenant.

If a lender waives its right (such right shall be at the Company’s request only) to receive its share of any
prepayment of the Senior Credit Facilities (“Waived Amounts”), such Waived Amounts may be retained by the
Senior Secured Group for any purposes not prohibited by the Senior Term Facilities Agreement (including
restricted payments), may be offered to any lender(s) selected by the Company which did not decline such
prepayment or applied in prepayment of any other permitted indebtedness.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

_Guarantor Coverage Test and Material Subsidiaries_

The Senior Credit Facilities will be guaranteed by the Senior Term Facilities Borrowers and the Guarantors
(together, the “Senior Secured Obligors”).

123

U.S. Newco); and (g) U.S. Newco will grant (i) a New York law general security agreement granting security
over substantially all of its assets (subject to customary exclusions); and (ii) a New York law share pledge in
respect of any shares it owns in any Material Subsidiary incorporated or organised in the US, provided that no
obligation of any US Obligor (as defined in the Senior Term Facilities Agreement) shall be secured by a Material
Subsidiary (A) that is a “controlled foreign corporation” within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code, that is
owned (within the meaning of Section 958(a) of the Code) by a member of the Group that is a “United States
Shareholder” (as defined in Section 951(b) of the Code), (B) all the assets of which consist of equity interests (or
equity interests and indebtedness) of one or more entities described in clause (A), and (C) that is a subsidiary of
an entity described in clause (A) or (B).

Each security provider in respect of ABL Priority Security shall provide second-priority security interest in
the ABL Priority Security in respect of the Senior Term Facilities, on the same date on which such security is
granted to the ABL Lenders.

Within ten Business Days (and excluding) from the Acquisition Closing Date, German Newco will grant
security over (a) the shares in the Target Business directly owned by it; and (b) structural intercompany
receivables owed to it directly (the “Target CS Security”).

Subject to certain adjustments and agreed security principles in the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, the
Company is required to ensure that members of the Senior Secured Group incorporated in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction (i) that generate at least 80% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled
“Description of the Notes”) of the Senior Secured Group within certain agreed jurisdictions (“Guarantor
Jurisdictions”), namely, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg,, the UK and the US (including any state thereof and the
District of Columbia) and the jurisdiction of incorporation of any borrower (the “Guarantor Coverage Test”) and
(ii) (A) is an Obligor; or (B) that individually generate more than 5% of LTM EBITDA of the Group (a “Material

the annual financial statements of the Company (or other applicable financial reporting entity) are required to be
delivered to the agent under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement.

As part of the guarantor accession process, security shall be granted (subject to the agreed security
principles): (a) by each wholly-owned Material Subsidiary which is not incorporated in an Excluded Jurisdiction
(being, any jurisdiction, state, territory or commonwealth other than a Guarantor Jurisdiction) over any shares it
holds in any other wholly-owned Material Subsidiary which is not incorporated in an Excluded Jurisdiction; and
(b) if the relevant acceding guarantor is incorporated in Canada, England and Wales or the United States shall
grant floating security over substantially all assets located in its jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to
customary exclusions, “excluded assets” including real estate) and in each case only to the extent to do so would
not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant company to conduct their business and operations
(as determined by such company in its sole and absolute discretion).

_Release of Guarantees and Security_

In addition to the circumstances described below under the sections entitled “—Intercreditor Agreement—
_Distressed Disposals” and “—Intercreditor Agreement—Non-distressed Disposals,” the Company may, subject_
to certain conditions, request the release of a guarantor from its guarantee under the Senior Term Facilities
Agreement if (i) such guarantor is the subject of a third-party disposal or other permitted activity under the

124


-----

Senior Term Facilities Agreement pursuant to which such guarantor will cease to be a member of the Senior
Secured Group, (ii) on a pro forma basis taking into account such release, the Guarantor Coverage Test will
continue to be satisfied or (iii) the lenders whose commitments under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement
aggregate greater than 50% of the total commitments under such facilities consent to such release. Upon the
effectiveness of a release pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the applicable guarantor would have no further
obligations under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, including any obligations to grant security in any Senior
Collateral owned by such guarantor.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to
certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other
matters set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Term Facilities Agreement.

The Senior Term Facilities Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants, information
undertakings and related definitions (with, in each case, certain adjustments), including (i) limitations on
indebtedness; (ii) limitations on restricted payments; (iii) limitations on liens (which includes a restriction on
designating certain credit facilities and/or hedging obligations secured on the Senior Collateral as Super Senior
Liabilities (as defined in the section entitled “—Intercreditor Agreement—Ranking and Priority”) unless, prior to
such designation, Senior Term Facilities has been refinanced in full (ignoring any participation (x) of a lender
which has been rolled over in a refinancing (or otherwise) of Senior Term Facilities and/or (y) in respect of
which a lender has declined prepayment)); (iv) limitations on sale of assets and subsidiary stock; (v) limitations
on affiliate transactions; (vi) designation of restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries (vii) merger and consolidation
undertakings with respect to (a) the Company, (b) German Newco and (c) U.S. Newco and (d) the guarantors of

accompanying compliance certificates, provided that the obligation to deliver financial information may differ

3.75:1; and (ii) the Issuer having a long-term corporate credit rating of BBB-, Baa3 (as applicable) or higher from
any 2 of Fitch, Moody’s Investor Services Limited or Standard & Poor’s Rating Services.

Notes. In addition, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement provides for additional events of default, subject to

125


-----

customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) misrepresentation; (ii) invalidity and
unlawfulness of the Senior Credit Facilities financing documents; and (iii) material failure to comply with the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Term Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection
with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English law
although the restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions scheduled to the Senior Term
Facilities Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the
Senior Term Facilities Agreement is governed by English law).

**ABL Facility Agreement**

In connection with the Acquisition, we expect to enter into a credit agreement governing our ABL Facility
with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent, co-collateral agent, swing line lender and a letter of
credit issuer, Citibank, N.A., London Branch or any of its affiliates as co-collateral agent, and certain other
lenders.

Following the closing of the Acquisition, German Newco, U.S. Newco and certain of German Newco’s
German subsidiaries will be the borrowers under the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility will include sub-facilities
for letters of credit and short-term borrowings referred to as swing line borrowings. Borrowings under the ABL
Facility will be made on a revolving basis in an amount to exceed the lesser of the commitments thereunder and
the then applicable borrowing base. The ABL Facility Agreement provides for an incremental facility of up to
€75.0 million.

The borrowing base shall be calculated, as of any date, by an amount equal to the sum of (a) (i) a specified
percentage of the loan parties’ eligible credit card receivables and eligible investment grade receivables and (ii) a
specified percentage of the loan parties’ other eligible accounts receivable, plus (b) the lesser of (i) a specified
percentage of the net orderly liquidation value or (ii) a specified percentage of the cost of the loan parties’
eligible inventory (including eligible in-transit inventory not in excess of an amount to be agreed), plus (c) the
lesser of (i) a specified percentage of the net orderly liquidation value or (ii) a specified percentage of the cost of
the loan parties’ eligible raw materials plus (d) the cash of the loan parties on deposit in accounts, minus (e) such
reserves as the agent to the ABL Facility establishes in its permitted discretion. Borrowings under the ABL
Facility by U.S. entities serving as borrowers or guarantors under the ABL Facility (the “US Loan Parties”) will
be limited by a separate borrowing base (the “US Sub-Borrowing Base”) consisting of the criteria described
above and limited to the assets of the U.S. Loan Parties. Borrowings under the ABL Facility by German entities
serving as borrowers under the ABL Facility (the “German Loan Parties”) will be limited by a separate
borrowing base consisting of the criteria described above and limited to the assets of such individual German
Loan Party plus the unborrowed amount of the U.S. Sub-Borrowing Base. In addition, the credit agreement
governing the ABL Facility will provide that we will have the right at any time, subject to customary conditions,
to solicit existing or prospective lenders to provide incremental revolving credit commitments and/or one or more
“last out” tranches, in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) a specified dollar amount and (y) the
amount by which the borrowing base exceeds the aggregate commitments under the ABL Facility at such time.
The lenders under our ABL Facility will not be under any obligation to provide any such incremental loans or
commitments, and any such addition of or increase in loans will be subject to certain customary conditions
precedent and other provisions.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Borrowings under our ABL Facility are expected to bear interest, at the option of the Borrower, at a rate per
annum equal to certain margins based on average availability over either (a) a base rate determined by reference
to the highest of (i) the U.S. prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal from time to time, (ii) the federal
funds effective rate, plus 1/2 of 1% and (iii) one month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% or (b) a LIBOR rate determined
by reference to the London interbank offered rate, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, subject to a
0.25 percent floor.

During the continuation of any payment event of default, the interest rate will be, with respect to overdue
principal, the applicable interest rate, plus 2.00% per annum and, with respect to any other overdue amount, the
interest rate applicable to base rate loans, plus 2.00% per annum.

A per annum fee equal to the applicable spread over the LIBOR rate under the ABL Facility in effect from
time to time will accrue on the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Credit

Facility, payable in arrears at the end of each quarter after the closing of our ABL Facility and upon termination
of the ABL Facility. In addition, the ABL Borrowers will pay (a) a fronting fee of 0.125% on the aggregate face
amount of outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Facility, payable in arrears at the end of each quarter after
the closing of our ABL Facility and upon termination of the ABL Facility and (b) such issuing bank’s customary
and reasonable issuance and administration fees.

The ABL Borrowers will pay to the lenders under the ABL Facility a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum
on the undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the ABL Facility, subject to one step-down to 0.25%
based on average utilization. All commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears after the closing of our
ABL Facility and upon the termination of the commitments.

**_Maturity_**

The ABL Facility will terminate on the day that is five years after the closing of our ABL Facility.

**_Guarantee and Security_**

The ABL Facility will be senior in right of payment and secured on a first-priority basis with respect to
accounts receivable (including credit card receivables), inventory, finished goods, raw materials, bank accounts
cash, cash equivalents, securities and deposit accounts, general intangibles and certain other assets, in each case,
to the extent evidencing or reasonably related to the foregoing (other than capital stock and intellectual property),
and books and records to the extent related to the foregoing and, in each case, proceeds thereof (the “ABL
Priority Collateral”) and a second-priority basis with respect to Senior Facilities Priority Collateral.

**_Certain Covenants_**

The ABL Facility will have affirmative covenants and negative covenants. Substantially similar to that
applicable to Senior Term Facilities as described in the section entitled “—Senior Term Facilities Agreement”
above.

The ABL Facility is expected to contain a financial maintenance covenant requiring compliance with a
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio tested on a trailing four-quarter period basis on the last day of each fiscal
quarter for which financial statements have been delivered or are required to be delivered solely during the
period (a) commencing on the day the sum of (x) availability and (y) the amount by which the borrowing base
exceeds the aggregate commitments (not to exceed 5% of commitments) at such time has been less than the
greater of (i) a specified percentage of the lesser of aggregate commitments and the borrowing base during such
time and (ii) a specified dollar amount and (b) continuing until, at all times thereafter during the period of
30 consecutive days, such threshold is exceeded. Breaches of this financial covenant are subject to customary
“equity cure” rights.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Lux SPV,
the Issuer, certain Guarantors and the Trustee are party to and certain other Guarantors will accede to an
Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the agent, the Security Agent, arrangers and lenders under the
Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the ABL Facility Agreement.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Company, the
Issuer, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider (as defined below), when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors
or Third Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms
pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and
turnover provisions and provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and
not the description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and of the Trustees. Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set-off,
discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement under the
relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt Financing, each agent in
respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each other person party to a Transaction
Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized and instructed to enter
promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or

other assurance against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any
liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a
contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being given under the

(as applicable)), (ii) over any asset required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in
relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any
Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of
such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation relation to

Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

acceleration event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of
default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien
Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior Secured
Discharge Date”), the Company, the members of the Senior Secured Group and Third Party Security Providers
may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the
finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest)
is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or
if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been
issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no payment default (subject to a de
minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under any
Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash
Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These
payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (b) of the next
paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second Lien
Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority Discharge Date”), the
Company, Topco Borrowers, Third Party Security Providers and other members of the Senior Secured Group
may only make specified scheduled payments (including any other direct or indirect step, matter, action or
dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement) under the
Topco Liabilities or under any Topco Proceeds Loan (together the “Topco Group Liabilities”) to the Topco
Creditors or any Topco Borrower or any holding company of the Company or other lender in respect of a Topco
Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (such payments, collectively, “Permitted
Topco Payments”):

(a) if:

      - no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

      - no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal,
interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management
Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document (a “Senior Secured Payment Default”), or
under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

      - the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco
Liabilities which is (x) not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the
Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to permit

134


-----

such payment have been obtained or (y) permitted as a Non-Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) or the result of any claim which is subject to Transaction Security, (2) any other amount
which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest (such other amounts including all
scheduled interest payments (including, if applicable, special interest (or liquidated damages))),
the accrual of cash interest otherwise payable during a period when a Topco Payment Stop Notice
(as defined below) is outstanding and default interest on the Topco Liabilities accrued and payable
in accordance with the terms of the relevant Topco Finance Document (as at the date of the issue
of the same or as amended in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
other Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions
relating to the Topco Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in any Topco
Finance Document, (3) made in pursuance of a debt buy-back program approved by the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority Second Lien Creditors
(each as defined below), or (4) amounts due under any syndication strategy letter relating to the
Topco Finance Documents;

(b) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other
than in respect of paragraph (N) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second Lien
Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower
under any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (L) below)
irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their debt, the
payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements (in
respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is (without
double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted
by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the Topco
Finance Documents, (B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring
advice and valuations (including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or
restructuring advisors) and a Topco Agent’s fees, costs and expenses not exceeding €1,500,000, but

affiliates), (C) of any amounts owed to a Topco Agent (as defined below), (D) of costs necessary to
protect, preserve or enforce security, (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums, amendment fees
(including any original issue discount and other consent and/or waiver fees) and any expenses incurred
in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) the Topco Finance Documents (including in relation to any
reporting or listing requirements under the Topco Finance Documents), (F) of any other amount not
exceeding €5,000,000 in any financial year of the Company (provided that any such amount not so
applied may be carried forward and utilized in the subsequent financial year (where it shall be deemed
to have been used first)), (G) of any amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable
but for the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment
Stop Notice is outstanding) which has been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco
Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in
respect of the Topco Liabilities during such period or any such amount described at (a)(iii) above,
provided that no such payment may be made if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior
Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment,
(H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or
Topco Group Liabilities which is continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or
otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of the
Company (“Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in
respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control as defined in any prior
ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member of
the Senior Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group, to the Subordinated
Creditors or to any other holding company of the Company that arise as a result of any such Debt for
Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors are granted
Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Subordinated Liabilities owed

Topco Borrower or its affiliates, (K) funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Topco

135


-----

Liabilities incurred under or pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents, (L) by the Topco Borrower in
respect of its obligations under the Topco Finance Documents; and such payment is not directly or
indirectly sourced from a member of the Senior Secured Group or such payment is funded from
proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from the Senior Secured Group without breaching the terms
of the Debt Documents, (M) if the payment is of a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and made
in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or
any other provision that permits the repayment in full of any Topco Creditor (without a related
requirement to repay all other Topco Creditors), or (N) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and the payment is a payment of
principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco
Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the
relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of
the applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(c) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior
consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco Finance
Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one (1) Business Day
after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a
“Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien
Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior
Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a
“Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under
any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien
Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities,
until the first to occur of:

(a) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice;

(b) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(c) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(d) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has
been remedied or waived;

(e) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super Senior
Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop
notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes
Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(f) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(g) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured
Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than forty five (45) days after the occurrence of the
relevant event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the
same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of three hundred and sixty (360) days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a
payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect

136


-----

of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco
Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of
interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
payment stop notice.

**_Cure of Payment Stop_**

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco
Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that
suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover by the Creditors_**
Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the latest
to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge
Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge
Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the
Designation Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party
Security Provider:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under “Application of Proceeds”;

(b) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(c) any amount:

(i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or a
Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security Provider (other than
after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event, other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”;

(d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”; or

(e) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which

137


-----

is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds” and which is
made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member
of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(1) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount
received or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the
Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly
pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery
exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(2) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay
an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from
any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the
enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or
the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts
which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions
set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Debtor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the
Senior Term Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or making
of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization (excluding
solvent reorganizations), (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (c) the appointment
of a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in
respect of it or any of its assets, or (d) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in
each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied
will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, ABL Facilities
Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider (in the
case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute
proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the
Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall
apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds”
below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an
amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that
the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect
and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an

138


-----

Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider.
The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these
provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an
Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as
specified in the provisions described below.

Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction
Security give such instruction or indicate any intention to give such instruction (or, as the case may be, do not
give any such instruction or indication):

(f) then either the ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group or the Senior Secured/Super Senior
Priority Instructing Group (together, the “STLDD Instructing Group”) may give instructions or
indication to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as such STLDD Instructing Group
sees fit in lieu of any instructions or indication to enforce given (or not given, as applicable) by the
agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (as applicable) and the
Security Agent shall act on such instructions first received from such STLDD Instructing Group;

(g) if either the Majority ABL Priority Security Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, in
relation to the ABL Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider that has granted
or purported to have granted ABL Priority Security (the “ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing
Group”) has not given an instruction to enforce the ABL Priority Security, the Senior Secured/Super
Senior Priority Instructing Group shall be permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce the ABL Priority Security as the Senior Secured/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group sees
fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given (or not given, as applicable) by the Second Lien Agent,
the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the Topco Creditor Representative and Security Agent shall act on
such instructions received from the Senior Secured/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group provided
that if the ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group subsequently provide such instructions in
relation to the ABL Priority Security then the Security Agent shall act on the instructions received from
the ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group; and

(h) if the Majority Senior Secured Priority Security Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, in
relation to the Senior Secured Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider that
has granted or purported to have granted Senior Secured Priority Security (the “Senior Secured/Super
Senior Priority Instructing Group”) has not given an instruction to enforce the Senior Secured Priority
Security, the ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group shall be permitted to give instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Priority Security as the ABL/Super Senior Priority
Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given (or not given, as applicable) by
the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors under the Intercreditor
provided that provided that if the Senior Secured/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group subsequently
provide such instructions in relation to the Senior Secured Priority Security then the Security Agent
shall act on the instructions received from the Senior Secured/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the ABL Discharge Date:

(1) the ABL Priority Security Creditors (other than Super Senior Creditors) representing more
than 50% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) provided
that in calculating Senior Credit Participations, the Senior Credit Participation of each of the
ABL Cash Management Facility Lenders and the ABL Hedge Counterparties shall be
deemed to be zero prior to the ABL Discharge Date (the “Majority ABL Priority Security
Creditors”); and

139

(2) the Senior Secured Priority Security Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors)
resenting more than 50% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior

but before the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Second Lien Creditors; and

_Enforcement of Transaction Security prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise by (i) the ABL Priority Instructing Group and/or the Senior Secured Priority

140


-----

Instructing Group (as applicable), (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, both of the ABL Priority
Instructing Group and the Senior Secured Priority Instructing Group have (A) given no instructions as to the
manner of enforcement or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not
required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), an agent
or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors)
where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if,
prior to the Priority Discharge Date, both of the ABL Priority Instructing Group and the Senior Secured Priority
Instructing Group (or Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions as to the
manner of enforcement or have instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not
required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco
Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing
Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may give or
refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Transaction
Security as they see fit.

Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction
Security give such instruction or indicate any intention to give such instruction (or, as the case may be, do not
give any such instruction or indication):

(a) then the applicable Instructing Group may give instructions or indication to the Security Agent to
enforce the Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions or
indication to enforce given (or not given, as applicable) by the agents or representatives of the Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (as applicable) and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions
received from the applicable Instructing Group;

(b) if the ABL Priority Instructing Group has not given an instruction to enforce the ABL Priority Security,
the Senior Secured Priority Instructing Group shall be permitted to give instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce the ABL Priority Security as the Senior Secured Priority Instructing Group sees fit in
lieu of any instructions or indication to enforce given (or not given, as applicable) by the Second Lien
Agent, the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the Topco Creditor Representative and such Second Lien
Agent, the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the Topco Creditor Representative may not provide any such
instructions of indications for a period of 90 days after such time as the Senior Secured Priority
Instructing Group is permitted to provide such instructions or indications and Security Agent shall act
on such instructions received from the Senior Secured Priority Instructing Group provided that if the
ABL Priority Instructing Group subsequently provide such instructions in relation to the ABL Priority
Security then the Security Agent shall act on the instructions received from the ABL Priority
Instructing Group; and

(c) if the Senior Secured Priority Instructing Group has not given an instruction to enforce the Senior
Secured Priority Security, the ABL Priority Instructing Group shall be permitted to give instructions to
the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Priority Security as the ABL Priority Instructing
Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions or indication to enforce given (or not given, as applicable) by
the Second Lien Agent, the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the Topco Creditor Representative under this
Agreement and such Second Lien Agent, the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the Topco Creditor
Representative may not provide any such instructions of indications for a period of 90 days after such
time as the ABL Priority Instructing Group is permitted to provide such instructions or indications and
Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the ABL Priority Instructing Group
provided that if the Senior Secured Priority Instructing Group subsequently provide such instructions in
relation to the Senior Secured Priority Security then the Security Agent shall act on the instructions
received from the Senior Secured Priority Instructing Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the
relevant Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the relevant Instructing Group determines
in good faith that to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s
ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement, before giving any
such instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the creditors
represented in the relevant Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other agent (provided that any
agent in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if such enforcement relates to Topco Shared

141


-----

Security) for a period of up to ten Business Days or take any Enforcement Action (the “Consultation Period”)
and the relevant Instructing Group will only be entitled to give the enforcement instructions described above or
take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or after the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction
Security has become enforceable, if (i) either the Majority ABL Priority Security Creditors or the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, in relation to the ABL Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider that
has granted or purported to have granted ABL Priority Security, or (ii) the Majority Senior Secured Priority
Security Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, in relation to the Senior Secured Priority Security and
any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider that has granted or purported to have granted Senior Secured Priority
Security wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial
Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i)(x) the Majority ABL Priority Security Creditors in
relation to any ABL Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider that has granted or
purported to have granted ABL Priority Security, and (y) the Majority Senior Secured Priority Security Creditors
in relation to any Senior Secured Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider that has
granted or purported to have granted Senior Secured Priority Security, (ii) if (x) the Majority ABL Priority
Security Creditors (in relation to any ABL Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider that
has granted or purported to have granted ABL Priority Security), and (y) the Majority Senior Secured Priority
Security Creditors (in relation to any Senior Secured Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider that has granted or purported to have granted Senior Secured Priority Security) have not made a
determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three
months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior Discharge has not occurred within six months of
the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action
taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior
Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if (x) the Majority ABL Priority Security Creditors (in relation to any ABL
Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider that has granted or purported to have granted
ABL Priority Security), and (y) the Majority Senior Secured Priority Security Creditors (in relation to any Senior
Secured Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider that has granted or purported to have
granted Senior Secured Priority Security) have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they
wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith
that a delay could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to
enforce the Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors
deliver instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from (A) the Majority ABL Priority
Security Creditors (in relation to any ABL Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider that
has granted or purported to have granted ABL Priority Security), and (B) the Majority Senior Secured Priority
Security Creditors (in relation to any Senior Secured Priority Security and any Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider that has granted or purported to have granted Senior Secured Priority Security), the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior
Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, both the ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing
Group and the Senior Secured/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group have not given instructions or they have
instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities
(the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of
the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the
Priority Discharge Date, the Majority ABL Priority Security Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Priority
Security Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable)
have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or
(B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal an agent or trustee under
the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions give such instruction or

142


-----

indicate any intention to give such instruction (or, as the case may be, do not give such instruction or indication),
then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is
entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given (or
not given, as applicable) by the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (as
applicable) and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions provided that notwithstanding the foregoing:

(a) if the ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group has not given an instruction to enforce the ABL
Priority Security, the Senior Secured/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group shall be permitted to give
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the ABL Priority Security as the Senior Secured/Super
Senior Priority Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given (or not given, as
applicable) by the Second Lien Agent or Topco Creditors and such Second Lien Agent, the Second
Lien Notes Trustee or the Topco Creditor Representative may not provide any such instructions for a
period of 90 days after such time as the Senior Secured/ Super Senior Priority Instructing Group is
permitted to provide such instructions and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received
from the Senior Secured/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group provided that if the ABL/Super Senior
Priority Instructing Group subsequently provide such instructions in relation to the ABL Priority
Security then the Security Agent shall act on the instructions received from the ABL/Super Senior
Priority Instructing Group; and

(b) if the Senior Secured/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group has not given an instruction to enforce
the Senior Secured Priority Security, the ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group shall be
permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Priority Security as
the ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given (or
not given, as applicable) by the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco
Creditors and such Second Lien Agent, the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the Topco Creditor
Representative may not provide any such instructions for a period of 90 days after such time as the
ABL/ Super Senior Priority Instructing Group is permitted to provide such instructions and Security
Agent shall act on such instructions received from the ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group
provided that if the Senior Secured Priority Instructing Group subsequently provide such instructions in
relation to the Senior Secured Priority Security then the Security Agent shall act on the instructions
received from the Senior Secured/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that (i) to
the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen
should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and
(iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or
other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is so requested by the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of
accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with
any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under
the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit
(which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any of the
Transaction Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security
Documents except through the Security Agent.

143

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply in

Topco Group Liabilities, if:

(a) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
“Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(b) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or

any agent under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, the Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

(ii) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve or
protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against

the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have given their consent to the relevant
Enforcement Action.

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in relation to
a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any later time, a further
Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior Secured
Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may, by giving not less than 10
days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent, elect to purchase all, but not part of, the Senior Lender Liabilities,
Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second
Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or
redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the
counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to
specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been
terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

“Qualifying Senior Secured Creditors”) may, by giving not less than 10 days’ prior written notice to the Security
Agent, elect to purchase all, but not part of, the ABL Lender Liabilities and ABL Cash Management Facility
Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus
certain costs and expenses. Qualifying Senior Secured Creditors must also elect for the counterparties to hedging
obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the
amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus
certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall (and is
irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement, instruction, direction,
confirmation, payment, certification or other document, request or information from any creditor, other Secured
Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Company to the Security Agent:

Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(i) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Company
has confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release and/
or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a disposal to

146


-----

a member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any
member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement
security; or

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents or where any applicable
release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document pursuant to
which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Secured Group;
and

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
“Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(ii) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to the extent that the
Company has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document to effect any
amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take any
action in relation to such document or agreement;

(iii) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of the
Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor simultaneously
with such release to the extent that the Company has confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or
guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the ABL Facility Agreement
(as applicable)); and

(iv) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent
that the Company has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such release is
otherwise, in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the ABL Facility Agreement
(as applicable));

(b) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interests in a Debtor, other member of the Senior
Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a
Debtor, other member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease
to be a member of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other
member of the Senior Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under
the Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents
(including any claim relating to a Debt Document); and

(c) effect a Debt Transfer (as defined below).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (a)(i), (a)(ii) and (b) above, the Company
shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the
date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Company, on the date that the definitive agreement for
such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (a)(iii) or (a)(iv) above, the Company shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or
cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security Principles
(as defined in the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the ABL Facility Agreement (as applicable)).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the
Senior Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor,
to the extent the Company has confirmed to the Security Agent that such disposal or other transaction or
designation is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a
borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to voluntarily
prepay all liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document to the applicable creditors concurrently with ceasing
to be a member of the Topco Group or Debtor; and any right to decline, delay or prevent any prepayment in any
Debt Document shall be disapplied to the extent that if exercised such right would prevent the repayment of all
such liabilities in full by such person (but without prejudice to any prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break
costs or other payment required by the relevant Finance Documents).

147


-----

The Company may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any borrower of Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien Lender Liabilities
(each, a “Borrower”) under the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or otherwise transferred by that
Borrower (a “Debt Transfer”) provided that (i) either (A) such Debt Transfer is to another member of the Senior
Secured Group; (B) such Debt Transfer is by a Borrower where (I) that Borrower or any holding company of that
Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the Finance Documents, and (II) the proceeds of such disposal
are not otherwise required to be applied unconditionally in prepayment of that Borrower’s liabilities under the
applicable Finance Documents; or (C) such Debt Transfer is undertaken in connection with an IPO, and (ii) the
transferee in respect of such Debt Transfer is another borrower under the Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender
Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien lender Liabilities (as applicable). Any Debt
Transfer may (and shall upon the request of the Company) be effected on a cashless basis, by way of book entries
and not as physical cash movement to repay and reborrow any applicable liabilities.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a
member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or
financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an
Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an
acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made, (b) by enforcement of
the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for
enforcement was made, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event which has occurred and is continuing
or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which has occurred and is
continuing, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the
Senior Secured Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (subject
to acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below) at the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party
Security Provider and the Company and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from
any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor:

(a) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter
into any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any
floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities;
(B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or
another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf
of the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company
or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intragroup lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets
or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to
dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their
subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(i) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that
any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into
any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any
other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

148


-----

(ii) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and
not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to:

(i) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(ii) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations
in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving
Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under
“—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not
occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal
or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Senior Secured Priority Instructing Group or,
after the Designation Date, the Senior Secured/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group are entitled to give, and
have given, instructions, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any ABL Priority Security or release any
Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any ABL Priority Security or borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities owed to any creditor in respect of the Senior Liabilities (a “Senior Creditor”), Senior Agent or an
arranger under the Original ABL Facility Agreement (or any arranger in respect of any Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement (a “Senior Arranger”)) by a Debtor, subsidiary or holding company who owns ABL Priority
Security unless an ABL Discharge Date will occur prior to or contemporaneous with that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the ABL Priority Instructing Group or, after the
Designation Date, the ABL/Super Senior Priority Instructing Group are entitled to give, and have given,
instructions, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Senior Secured Priority Security or release any
Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any Senior Secured Priority Security or borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities owed to any holder of a Senior Secured Note or Hedge Counterparty by a Debtor, subsidiary
or holding company who owns Senior Secured Priority Security unless the Senior Secured Priority Liabilities
have been fully and finally discharged prior to or contemporaneous with that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to
give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities or any other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities,
guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full
(or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary
facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately
following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized

to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any
other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing
liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit,
cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to
the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that release.

Where borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the provisions
described above, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities
transferred to a holding company of the Company specified by such creditor, in which case the Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Company and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so
transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (d) and (e) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless the consent of
each Senior Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained, it is a further
condition to any release, transfer or disposal that:

(a) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(b) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(i) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process conducted with the advice of a
reputable, independent and internationally recognized investment bank or firm of accountants or
(if all such banks or firms are conflicted), a reputable, independent and internationally recognized
third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or
assets similar or comparable to those subject to the relevant Transaction Security and, in each
case, not being an auditor or administrator or other relevant officer of the applicable company (a
“Financial Advisor”) as selected by the Security Agent (it being acknowledged that the Security
Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Advisor until it has been indemnified
and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), in respect of which the Secured Creditors are
entitled to participate (a “Competitive Sales Process”); or

(ii) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an
enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent
and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors
on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale or
disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances
including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no
obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured
and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (d) and (e) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities and/or Transaction Security
securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(a) each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or
disposal; or

(b) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are sold:

(c) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(d) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent permitted
by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors and Unsecured
Creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or disposed of (a “Relevant
Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all security under
documents creating security in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the assets of such
members of the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged
concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee

150

(acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a
greater cash amount if such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its
affiliates and not released or discharged and provided such amount is nevertheless less than the
aggregate amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case if
there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and
in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially
all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of Senior Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice
on the Security Agent confirming the same, then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to
sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(e) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a Competitive
Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion
(including an enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group which can be relied upon by the
Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco

prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs
(d) and (e) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities or Transaction Security securing Topco
Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the provisions described above, it is a further
condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

or

(b) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Topco Liabilities are sold:

(i) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(ii) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors
and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or disposed of
(a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and discharged or sold or
disposed of concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all
security under documents creating security in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the
assets of such members of the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and unconditionally
released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent, Senior
Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting
reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Priority Secured Parties will recover a greater
cash amount if such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its
affiliates and not released or discharged and provided such amount is nevertheless less than the
aggregate amount of outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case
if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and
trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines
that there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of
the outstanding amount of the Priority Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice on the
Security Agent confirming the same, then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell
and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(c) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a Competitive
Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion
(including an enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group which can be relied upon by the
Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco
Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale
or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances
including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation
to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or
prefunded to its satisfaction).

“Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the
proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the
creditors in that specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments
amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after
taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**Required Consents**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the Company, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security

155


-----

Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and
such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the
interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the relevant agent or trustee acting on
behalf of the affected class (or in the case of hedging counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty) shall be
required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under “Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of:

(a) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the
Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(b) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver
would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender
under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations
of any other creditor or class of creditors other than the Cash Management Facility Lenders (solely in
their capacity as such)),

(c) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or
class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their capacity as such)), and

(d) the Company.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or
authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to
any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

**_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_**

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent
(a) may, if the Company consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant
consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which
shall be binding on each party, and (b) may if the Company consents, and shall promptly upon request of the
Company, amend, release and/or retake any document creating Transaction Security where such amendment,
release and/or retake is required in order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the relevant Transaction
Security, together with any related or consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure to register any
relevant document with Companies House within the prescribed time limit set out in section 859 of the
Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security Agent shall also irrevocably waive any payment or other
obligation or default arising out of such failure to register) and any such amendment, release, waiver and retake
shall be binding on each Party.

Where any such amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets
subject to Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) or the manner in
which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are
distributed, such amendment may not be made without the prior consent of:

(a) each of the agents or trustees other than an agent under any Cash Management Facility, if appointed
(acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super
Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(b) each Cash Management Facility Lender or the agent for the relevant Cash Management Facility on its
behalf but only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect
the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement
in their capacity as such and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors,

(c) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the under the Intercreditor

156


-----

Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or
class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their capacity as such)), and

(d) the Company.

**_Exceptions_**

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including any ability of
that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the
consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “Amendments and Waivers: Transaction
_Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to_
(i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security, claims or liabilities, or (ii) to
any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the
provisions set out under “New Debt Financings,” “Non-Distressed Disposals” and “Distressed Disposals” above.
Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt
Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the Company and the Security Agent.

**_Snooze / Lose_**

If in relation to:

(a) a request for a consent in relation to any of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze / lose provision or
which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(b) a request to participate in any vote of a class of creditors under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar
snooze / lose provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor
Agreement);

(c) a request to approve any other action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze / lose provision or
which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement); or

(d) a request to provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other
Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze / lose provision or
which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement),

then, in each case, any creditor:

(i) fails to respond to that request within ten (10) Business Days (or any other period of time notified
by the Company, with the prior agreement of the Agents if the period for this provision to operate
is less than ten (10) Business Days) of that request being made; or

(ii) fails to provide details of its participation within the timescale specified by the Security Agent:

(iii) in the case of paragraphs (a) to (c) above, that the creditor’s participation (as the case may be)
shall be deemed to be zero for the purpose of calculating their participation in respect of the
matter when ascertaining whether any relevant percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
unanimity) of their participation or has been obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or
approve that action;

(iv) in the case of paragraphs (a) to (c) above, that the creditor’s status shall be disregarded for the
purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified group of creditors has been
obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or approve that action; and

(v) in the case of paragraph (d) above, that confirmation or notification shall be deemed to have been
given,

provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Snooze/Loose clause shall not apply to any Noteholder in
respect of any request where such Noteholder is not given the option to respond to such request in the negative
but shall otherwise apply to all Noteholders.

thereof) (an “IPO Event”), the Company is entitled to give notice to each agent and each hedge counterparty (a
“Pushdown Notice”) that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate (with effect from the date
specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “IPO Pushdown Date”)) so that, amongst other things, (i) the

the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Company which is the issuer or borrower of any

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the €430.0 million aggregate principal amount of % Senior Notes
due 2029 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by BK LC Lux Finco 1 S.à r.l., a limited liability company
(société à responsibilité limitée) organized and existing under the laws of Luxembourg, having its registered
office at 40, Avenue Monterey, L-2163 Luxembourg and registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies
Register under number B252262 (the “Issuer”). For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” (i) the “Issuer”
refers only to BK LC Lux Finco 1 S.à r.l., and none of its subsidiaries, (ii) the “BIRKENSTOCK Group” refers
to (x) prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, Birkenstock GmbH & Co KG, Birkenstock Immobilien GmbH &
Co. KG and Birkenstock Cosmetics GmbH & Co. KG, together with their respective Subsidiaries and (y) after
the Acquisition Closing Date, Birkenstock Holding B.V. & Co. KG together with its Subsidiaries, as the context
may require, and (iii) the “Group” refers to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, collectively.

The proceeds from the offering of the Notes issued on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer, together
with certain proceeds from Facility B, the Equity Contribution, the Vendor Note and the Shareholder Rollover, to
pay the purchase price for the Acquisition, to repay certain Existing Debt, as cash overfunding and to pay certain
fees and expenses in connection therewith and in connection with the offering of Notes, as set forth in this
offering memorandum under the caption “Summary—The Transactions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions”
and “Use of Proceeds.”

If and to the extent that the Issue Date is expected to occur more than three business days prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date, pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other
conditions as described below, the Issuer will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering of Notes on the Issue
Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes
sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account (as defined below). In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop
Date (as defined below) occurs and the Escrow Agent and the Trustee (each, as defined below) shall not have
received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) on or prior to such date or (ii) the Issuer
informs the Escrow Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the
Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will redeem the entire
outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the Notes as stated
on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional
Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date
(as defined below). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” If and to the extent the Issue
Date is expected to occur within three business days prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer shall not be
required to deposit cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account.

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and
the Initial Guarantors (as defined below) and will not be guaranteed by any member of the BIRKENSTOCK
Group. Assuming that the Acquisition Closing Date occurs on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the PostClosing Guarantors will, within 120 days from the Business Day immediately after the Acquisition Closing Date,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws,
substantially concurrently with such entity’s guarantee of the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, accede to the
Indenture (as defined below) and the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantee the Notes on a senior subordinated
basis.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, neither the Issuer nor the Initial Guarantors will control the
BIRKENSTOCK Group, and no member of the BIRKENSTOCK Group will be subject to the covenants
described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Acquisition Closing
Date, the BIRKENSTOCK Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the
Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date, and any such non-compliance
will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date,
among, inter alios, the Issuer, the Initial Guarantors, GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and
Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as security agent (the “Security Agent”). The Notes will be issued in a private
transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and will be subject to certain
terms restricting their transfer. See “Notice to Investors.” The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

159


-----

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and refers to the Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Transaction Security Documents and the Escrow Agreement. Because this is a
summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read each of the Indenture,
the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Transaction Security Documents and the Escrow Agreement in their
entirety. Copies of such documents are available as described under “Where You Can Find Other Information.”
The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this “Description of the Notes” as so
defined.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of a conflict between the Indenture, the Notes or the Transaction
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and
security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement
action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

The Issuer will not be required to, nor does the Issuer currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for
notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under
the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, or incorporate by reference or include, or be subject
to, any provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Accordingly, the terms of the
Notes include only those stated in the Indenture, and the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided
under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among
other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform
Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be obligations of the Issuer, guaranteed solely
by the Initial Guarantors, will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral (as defined below) and to the extent the
proceeds of the Notes are deposited into the Escrow Account the Escrowed Property (as defined below) and will
not have the benefit of any Note Guarantees or any other credit support from the BIRKENSTOCK Group. See
“—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, neither the
Issuer nor the Initial Guarantors will control the BIRKENSTOCK Group, and no member of the
BIRKENSTOCK Group will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such,
we cannot assure you that, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the BIRKENSTOCK Group will not engage in
activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to
such entities as of the Issue Date, and any such non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event of Default
under the Indenture prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

The Notes will:

   - be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including their respective obligations in respect of the
Senior Secured Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations;

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Issuer and
their respective subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes (including
the obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities), to the extent of the property and value of the assets
securing such Indebtedness or liabilities;

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock and obligations to trade creditors, of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors;

   - be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis (i) on the Issue Date, by the Initial Guarantors and
(ii) within 120 days from the Business Day immediately after the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to

160


-----

the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the
Post-Closing Guarantors; and

   - be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be
represented by certificated Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will:

   - be a general senior subordinated obligation of the Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

   - be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of that Guarantor,
including its obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
not subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor;

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or other liabilities of such
Guarantor and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes or the
Note Guarantees, including obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities, or that is secured on a
senior-priority basis over property or assets that secure the Notes or the Note Guarantees on a juniorpriority basis, including the obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities, to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such Indebtedness or liabilities; and

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock and obligations to trade creditors, of Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not
Guarantors.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and
other laws and be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles.

As of December 31, 2020, as adjusted to give effect to the Transaction, the Issuer and its consolidated
Subsidiaries would have had total as adjusted Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of €1,506.6 million,
including the Notes offering hereby and €1,075.0 million (equivalent) of term loan drawings under the Senior
Term Facilities Agreement. The €200.0 million (equivalent) ABL Facility is expected to remain undrawn as of
the Issue Date.

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €430.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes
will mature on, 2029. Each series of Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Euroclear and Clearstream (as
applicable, the “Relevant Clearing Systems” and each, a “Relevant Clearing System”) are not required to monitor
or enforce the minimum amount. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the
payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable. If
the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is
due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any
such delay.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable, in cash, semiannually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2021. The Issuer will make
each interest payment for so long as the Notes are global Notes to the Holders of record at the close of business
(in Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable) on the Clearing System Business Day immediately before the due
date for such payment, where “Clearing System Business Day” means a day on which the Relevant Clearing
System

161


-----

for which the global note representing the Notes is being held is open for business, or to the extent Definitive
Registered Notes have been issued, Holders of record at the close of business on the and
preceding the applicable interest payment date. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to
which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on
overdue principal and interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the
overdue principal or interest. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date. If the Issuer
delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before
the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption
date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of
business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of Relevant Clearing System, and no
additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Any Notes represented by global notes held by a nominee of the Relevant Clearing System will be subject to
the then applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable. Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s
current practice is to make payments in respect of global notes to participants of record that hold an interest in the
relevant global notes on the business day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date.

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €430.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of Notes will be issued on the Issue Date. The Issuer may issue additional Notes (the
“Additional Notes”) from time to time under the Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants contained
in the Indenture. Any series of Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the relevant series of
Notes, as applicable, originally issued, except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in
an Officer’s Certificate (defined below) or, at the election of the Issuer, a supplemental indenture, delivered to
the Trustee:

(1) whether such Additional Notes shall be issued as part of a new or existing series of Notes or the title of
such Additional Notes (which shall distinguish the Additional Notes of the series from Notes of any
other series);

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or
rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such
interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the
determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such
interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Notes Guarantees and Transaction Security
Documents.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for
such series in such Officer’s Certificate or supplemental indenture (as applicable); provided that any Additional

162


-----

Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of Notes offered hereunder for U.S. federal income tax
purposes shall have a separate ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification number from such Notes.
Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,”
references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well
as any Additional Notes.

**Payments**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to the Notes represented by
one or more global notes held by a common depositary of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name
of its nominee will be made through the Principal Paying Agent (as defined below) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the registered Holder or Holders thereof (initially being
the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to certificated Notes will
be payable at the office or agency of one or more paying agents maintained for such purpose (the “Principal
Paying Agent”) or, may, at the option of the Issuer, be made through the Principal Paying Agent by check mailed
to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all
payments of principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to certificated
Notes may, at the option of the Issuer, be made by wire transfer to a euro account maintained by the payee with a
bank in the United States or Europe if the applicable Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written
notice to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days
immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Principal Paying Agent may
accept in its discretion).

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures
of the Relevant Clearing System. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at
the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest
or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain a Paying Agent for the Notes and the initial Principal Paying Agent will be GLAS
Trust Company LLC. The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”) for the Notes. The initial Registrar will be GLAS Trust Company LLC and the initial Transfer
Agent will be GLAS Trust Company LLC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the
Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent will facilitate transfers of the
Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. For so long as Notes are listed on the Official
List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and if and to the extent that the rules of The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority
of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as
Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes, provided that it segregates and holds in a separate trust fund
for the benefit of the Holders all money held by it as paying agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee
may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer
of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. Any such transfer or exchange will be made
without charge to Holders, other than any taxes payable in connection with such transfer. The Issuer and the
Transfer Agent will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and
not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer (each
as defined herein). None of the Issuer, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will be required to transfer or
exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed
or between record date and payment date. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the absolute owner
of the Note for all purposes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

163


-----

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, each Initial Guarantor will be a “Restricted Subsidiary” for the purposes of the
Indenture. Immediately after the completion of the Acquisition on the Acquisition Closing Date, each member of
the BIRKENSTOCK Group as of such date will become Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” the
Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee,
provide security with respect to, or have their shares pledged in favour of, the Notes.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

If the Issue Date is expected to occur more than three Business Days prior to the Acquisition Closing Date,
then, concurrently with the closing of this offering of Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into an escrow
agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”) among the
Issuer, the Trustee, GLAS Specialist Services Limited as escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its
successors, the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which the Issuer will deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf,
an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the escrow account (the
“Escrow Account”). To the extent an Escrow Account is established, it will be segregated from the Issuer’s other
funds. Such Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent subject to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The initial funds deposited in the Escrow
Account (if any), and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and
payments credited to the Escrow Account in connection with the Notes (less any property or funds paid in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement such as ordinary course charges and fees paid to the bank holding the
Escrow Account) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” Interest on the Notes will be
calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes.

To the extent the proceeds of the Offering are deposited into the Escrow Account, in order to secure the
payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Notes, as applicable, the Issuer
will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, subject to certain liens of the
Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account and the Issuer’s rights under the Escrow
Agreement, pursuant to one or more escrow account charges dated on or about the Issue Date between the Issuer,
the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Charge”); provided that such liens and security interest shall
automatically be released and terminate upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s
Certificate (as defined below) or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined below). The Escrow
Charge (if any) will provide that the funds will be segregated and held for the purposes specified herein. By its
acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as
directed by the Issuers in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit products) as permitted
under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments, as the Issuers will from time to time direct in
writing. Receipt by the Trustee of either an Officer’s Certificate for the release or a notice of Special Mandatory
Redemption shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the release of the Escrowed Property from the
Escrow Charge.

The Escrow Agreement (if any) will provide for the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account,
upon instruction of the Issuer, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the amount of accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the most recent
interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the Escrow Release in
order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Notes under the Indenture as set forth under
“—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having accrued on the
Escrowed Property.

Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in the
previous paragraph, the Issuer will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release any Escrowed Property (in
which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Issuer) (the “Escrow Release”) (the date
of the Escrow Release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or
prior to September 30, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release

164


-----

Officer’s Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further
investigation, certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”) will be met
substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Release on the Escrow Release Date:

   - the Escrowed Property will be applied in substantially the same manner as described in this offering
memorandum;

   - the Acquisition will be consummated no more than three Business Days following the release of the
Escrowed Property substantially on the terms set forth under “Summary—The Transactions” except for
any changes or other modifications that will not, when taken as a whole, have a material adverse effect
on the Holders of the Notes; and

   - as of the Acquisition Closing Date, there is no Default or Event of Default in respect of the Issuer
under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the section titled “—Events of Default”.

Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Accounts in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Escrow Accounts will
be reduced to zero.

In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the
Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Issuer informs the Escrow Agent and the
Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or
prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuer
will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory
Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the issue price of the
Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes
and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (as defined below), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, and will provide that the Notes
shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is given by the Issuer in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder of
Notes, the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes, shall be entitled to use the Escrowed
Property to make such payments and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess
Escrowed Property to the Issuer.

The Escrow Accounts will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the
Notes that is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes exceeds the amount of the
applicable Escrowed Property, the Parent will be required to make an equity contribution to the Issuer to fund the
difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed
Property.

The Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more replacement or
additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which, in each case, must be the Trustee, Escrow Agent, an
Initial Purchaser or one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the
Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being
deemed a Release; provided that the Issuer provide a substantially equivalent security interest to the Trustee for
the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security interest was
initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; provided, further, that use of the funds from
any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Escrow Account. In such an
event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be
an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a
Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the Escrowed Property from the
original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account.

165


-----

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority that the Special
Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

The conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified by Holders
representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally,
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by BK LC Lux SPV S.à r.l., a private limited
liability company (société à responsabilité limitée), having its registered office at 40, Avenue Monterey, L-2163
Luxembourg and registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register under number B252419 (“Lux
_SPV”), Birkenstock Holding B.V. & Co. KG (“German Newco”) and BK LC US BidCo Inc. (“U.S. Newco” and_
together with Lux SPV and German Newco, the “Initial Guarantors”). Subject to and in accordance with the
Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, within 120 days from the
Business Day immediately after the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior
subordinated basis by certain members of the BIRKENSTOCK Group organized in Germany and the United States
that guarantee the Senior Term Facilities Agreement within 120 days from the Business Day immediately after the
Post-Closing Date (the “Post-Closing Guarantors”). The Senior Secured Facilities will be guaranteed on a senior
secured basis by each Post-Closing Guarantor. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor_
Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee
in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020,
(i) all the members of the BIRKENSTOCK Group organized in the United States and (ii) the material members of
the BIRKENSTOCK Group incorporated in Germany, in each case, which assets and shares (as applicable) are
being transferred to the Purchasers pursuant to the Transactions, represented 80.8% of the consolidated revenues of
the BIRKENSTOCK Group, such entities’ unconsolidated assets represented 80.9% of the sum of the
unconsolidated assets of the BIRKENSTOCK Group and such entities’ unconsolidated EBITDA represented 92.4%
of the consolidated EBITDA of the BIRKENSTOCK Group.

By its terms, the obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum
amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent
conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to
comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws and the Note Guarantees of, or the relevant
Note Documents to be entered into by, certain Guarantors organized in certain jurisdictions, including, without
limitation, Germany and the United States, will contain language limiting the amount of indebtedness guaranteed
or qualifying the Note Guarantee in order to address applicable local law considerations (including preservation
of share capital and statutory reserves, capitalization, prohibited financial assistance, corporate benefit principles
and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders and directors). In
addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as
described below under “—Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of
guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, the ABL Facility
Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees
where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or
requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization”
rules, capital maintenance rules, liquidity impairment rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where
the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By
virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note
Guarantee. However, such limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_the Collateral” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and other_
_applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of_
_another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and_
_enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be_

166


-----

subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Issuer is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital stock of its
Subsidiaries. As such, the Issuer will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments to them to
service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes.

A significant portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not
expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security
granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantors,
including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those
Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against
joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint
ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each
Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures.
Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including Disqualified Stock, and Preferred Stock
of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the
Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Subordination of the Note Guarantees_**

The Note Guarantees will be senior subordinated indebtedness, which means that, pursuant to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Note Guarantees will rank behind, and will be expressly
subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors, including any obligations
under the Senior Term Facilities, the ABL Facility and any future Indebtedness that ranks pari passu therewith.
As a result of this subordination, holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor will be entitled to receive full
payment on all obligations owed to them before any payment can be made to Holders of the Notes in respect of
such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors is subject to
significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. For example, the ability of the Trustee or the Holders to take
enforcement action with respect to the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain standstill provisions and
payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. The Trustee and the Holders will not be able to enforce
the Note Guarantees until the expiration of the applicable standstill period (generally 179 days) for so long as
amounts under Senior Indebtedness remain outstanding. For a description of the restrictions imposed by the
Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be
subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the sale of Lux SPV pursuant to an
enforcement of security over shares of Lux SPV taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an
instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that
holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) of the Guarantors would recover
disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to
such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or
interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_the Notes—Your right to receive payment under the Note Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior_
_ranking debt of the Guarantors.”_

**_Note Guarantee Releases_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(1) a direct or indirect sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such
Guarantor (as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary), or (ii) all
or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor, to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary and otherwise in compliance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

167


-----

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes and the Indenture, as provided in
“—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, including in respect of the provisions relating to an IPO Debt Pushdown;

(5) upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor under the
Senior Term Facilities Agreement, provided that such Guarantor is not providing a Guarantee in
respect of any other Credit Facility that replaces the Senior Term Facilities Agreement at such time that
will not also be released substantially simultaneously with the release of the Notes Guarantee and/or a
Guarantee under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”;_

(7) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another
Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the covenant
under “—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Transaction;

(9) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; and

(10) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

The Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
and subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Indenture, take all necessary actions at
the reasonable request and cost of the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set
forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other
action or consent on the part of the Trustee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to
make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge. The Issuer may in its sole
discretion, and without prejudice to any future election in relation thereto, elect to have any Note Guarantee
remain in place, as opposed to being released.

**Security**

**_General_**

If the Issue Date is expected to occur more than three business days prior to the Acquisition Closing Date,
on the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will be secured on a first-priority basis by the
Escrow Charge. Upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate or a notice of
Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrowed Property will be released and the first-priority security interests
over the Escrowed Property will automatically be released and terminate.

In addition, on the Issue Date, subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes
and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured by:

   - on a first-priority basis, (i) a share pledge in respect of the Parent’s shares in the capital of the Issuer
pursuant to a Luxembourg law share pledge agreement, (ii) a pledge in respect of all the material bank
accounts of the Issuer located in Luxembourg pursuant to a Luxembourg law governed bank account
pledge agreement, and (iii) a Luxembourg law receivables pledge agreement in respect of any
intercompany receivables owed to the Parent by the Issuer in respect of any proceeds loan or other
shareholder loan (collectively, the “SUN Collateral”); and

   - on a junior-priority basis, (i) a security assignment and/or receivables pledge agreement in respect of
any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by German Newco and Lux SPV and (ii) a
share pledge in respect of the Issuer’s shares in the capital of Lux SPV pursuant to a Luxembourg law
governed share pledge agreement (collectively, the “Shared Collateral” and, together with the SUN
Collateral and the Escrow Charge, the “Collateral”).

168


-----

The Collateral and any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure
obligations under the Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture in accordance with the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement constitute “Charged Property.”

The Shared Collateral will secure the Senior Term Facilities and the ABL Facility on a senior basis to the
Notes and Notes Guarantees, and may also secure certain Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness
on a senior basis. The Collateral may also secure any Additional Notes and certain other future Indebtedness on a
_pari passu or junior basis._

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer and_
the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Charged Property in connection with
future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain
requirements described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Charged Property will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and holders of the
other secured obligations that are secured by the Charged Property pursuant to the Transaction Security
Documents. All Charged Property will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Note Guarantees
granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Charged Property may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations
owed to the Holders. No appraisals of the Charged Property have been made in connection with the offering of
the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Charged Property will be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Charged Property may not be able to be sold in a short period of
time, or at all. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Charged Property may not be sufficient to satisfy the
obligations owed to the Holders. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Notes will be secured only
_to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will be granted as security for the Notes and future secured debt_
_may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—_
_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes_
_and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

The Liens on the Charged Property will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising
under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Charged Property (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose
or benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity impairment or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights
of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations,
see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over_
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), and certain guarantees may not be granted
in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms
of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among others:

   - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other
competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination,
“transfer pricing”, “thin capitalization”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and
other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions”, “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity
_impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval_
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a
guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise
and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly; provided that, to the extent requested
by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant
member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without
adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such
guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

169


-----

- a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be
taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable
time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs
and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal and notarial fees and adverse effects
on the ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements,
including any factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted under the Indenture) which will
not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or
security;

- members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they
are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the
relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their
officers or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have
the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer of or for any
member of the Group; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any
applicable security document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships
with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document
shall be subject to such limit;

- guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and
like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed
between the Issuer and the Security Agent;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting
security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be
granted over the material assets only;

- it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over
certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint
(including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement
(other than restrictions contained in the constitutional documents of a member of the Group or in any
intra-Group loan agreement), which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or
being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party,
supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable
security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights,
benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require
the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member
thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security document;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the
security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as
otherwise permitted by the Finance Documents (as defined in the section entitled “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” above) (including dealing with the_
secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to
lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Acceleration Event (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) which is continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security
Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to the
Agreed Security Principles;

- any security document will only be required to be notarized if required by law in order for the relevant
security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

- no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any acquired person or asset (and no
consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support Acquired
Indebtedness to the extent such Acquired Indebtedness is permitted by the Indenture to remain
outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an
acquisition permitted by the Indenture shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security with
respect to the Notes if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired

170


-----

indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such
Acquired Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to
an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no security will be
granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any debt permitted by the Indenture and/or to the
extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by a Finance Document to the
contrary;

   - no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be
required;

   - security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in
relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent
the creation of Transaction Security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or
customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

   - to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favor of the Security Agent and not the
secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security documents for all
secured parties); “parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary, to the extent permitted by
applicable law (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security
documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees
or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a secured party;

   - guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another
member of the Group;

   - each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction permitted under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security granted under each security document shall
be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the
relevant security document and creation of the relevant security;

   - no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement;

   - the secured parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will
not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the Finance
Documents prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event which is continuing;

   - no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap
Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation”, and any update thereto by the LSTA;

   - other than a general filing relating to a floating charge or blanket lien, no perfection, filing or other
action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or not in
Canada, Germany, Luxembourg, United Kingdom, the United States of America (each, a “Guarantor
Jurisdiction”) or otherwise over the shares of a member of the Group not located in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction; and

   - no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be
required to be prepared or provided to the secured parties, unless (i) required for such documents to
become effective or admissible in evidence and (ii) an Acceleration Event is continuing.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by the
Issuer.

**_Priority_**

The relative contractual priority with regard to the security interests in the Charged Property that are created
by the Transaction Security Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between
(a) the lenders under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, (b) the lenders under the ABL Facility Agreement,
(c) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (d) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders
under the Indenture and (e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be
Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured by such Charged Property, respectively, will be established by the

171


-----

terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that (i) the obligations under the
Senior Term Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations and the guarantees thereof are secured
equally and ratably by, among other things, first-priority Security Interests in the Shared Collateral, (ii) the Notes
and the Note Guarantees are secured equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests in the SUN Collateral,
(iii) the obligations under the ABL Facility Agreement are secured, among other things in equally and ratably by
second-priority Security Interests in the Shared Collateral and (iv) the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are
secured equally and ratably by third-priority Security Interests in the Shared Collateral. Pursuant to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of, or certain distressed
disposals of, the SUN Collateral on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated
in right of payment to the Notes. In addition, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of, or
certain distressed disposals of, the Shared Collateral only after any existing or future Indebtedness with a priorranking Lien on such Shared Collateral is repaid in full, including the Senior Term Facilities and the ABL
Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to
instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The circumstances in which the holders of the Notes may
instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of the Security Interests over the Shared
Collateral are significantly limited. Generally, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the holders of priorranking security interests in the Shared Collateral will be entitled to control virtually all decisions relating to the
exercise of remedies with respect to these Security Interests, will be able to block enforcement of such Security
Interests, will be able to release the Security Interests constituting Shared Collateral in certain circumstances and
will receive any proceeds from the enforcement of those Security Interests before amounts will be available to
the holders of the Notes.

In general, the rights of the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf or on behalf of the holders of the
Notes) to take enforcement action under the Transaction Security Documents with respect to the Shared
Collateral will be subject to certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on
enforcement. The Trustee and the holders of the Notes may only act through the Security Agent and will not be
able to independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Transaction Security Documents or
until the expiration of the applicable standstill period (being a period of up to 179 days subject to certain
exceptions) and for so long as any amounts under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging
Obligations and any such other Senior Indebtedness or obligations remain outstanding, force a sale of such
Shared Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_Transaction Security Documents_**

Under the Transaction Security Documents, the Issuer and the Parent will grant security over the Charged
Property to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the
Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Transaction Security Documents will be entered into by the
relevant security provider and the Security Agent for itself and as agent for the secured parties. When entering
into such Transaction Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the
secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement,
the ABL Facility Agreement and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security
Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws governing the creation and perfection of Security Interests and local
court decisions, the relevant Transaction Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created
under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the
Note Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under the law in certain of these
jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Escrow Charge (if any) will be granted to the
_Trustee and the security interests in the remaining Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent, in each case,_
_rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to_
_enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

The Escrow Charge (if any) will be granted solely for the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of
the Notes, and no other persons (including for the avoidance of doubt any lender under the Senior Term Facilities
Agreement, any lender under the ABL Facility Agreement, counterparties under any Hedging Obligations or any
other creditors) will be entitled to benefit from the Escrow Charge.

172


-----

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Transaction Security Documents on behalf of the
Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Charged Property securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the
Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent. In
addition, prior to the discharge of obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations
and other obligations constituting priority indebtedness under the Intercreditor Agreement, the representatives of
the Holders will be subject to a 179-day standstill on the taking of any enforcement action over the Shared
Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Transaction Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in
the Charged Property until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the
Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as
provided under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Transaction Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in
the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the
Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to
recover any amounts under the Transaction Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes—The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes,_
_or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such_
_security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Transaction
Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The ability to enforce may also be_
restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Charged Property in
compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations
secured by the Charged Property and the Trustee will have or have and, by accepting a Note as described below,
each Holder will be deemed to have appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed (without any further
consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Transaction Security
Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically
given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents securing such
Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Transaction Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act in its name and on its behalf to enter
into and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Transaction Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with,
any waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee
or the Security Agent on its behalf) and to be bound thereby and to perform their respective obligations
and exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith.

173

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Escrow Charge (if any) will be
_granted to the Trustee and the security interests in the remaining Collateral will be granted to the Security_
_Agent, in each case, rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Trustee or the Security_
_Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, release of
the Security Interests in respect of the Charged Property will be permitted under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) other than the Liens over the Capital Stock of the Issuer, in connection with any sale or other
disposition of Charged Property to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but
excluding any transaction subject to “—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition
does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets
_and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted_
Subsidiary; provided that this sub-clause (b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital
Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a
Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets
remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or
disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the Issuer as Receivables
Assets in connection with a Receivables Facility;

(6) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Charged
Property, or the sale or transfer of such property or assets, which may include Charged Property, in
each case pursuant to a Qualified Securitization Financing;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Transaction; or

(8) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Transaction Security Documents will be released (a) in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including in respect of
the provisions relating to an IPO Debt Pushdown and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Interests over the assets subject to the Escrow Charge will be released upon the occurrence of
the Escrow Release or in connection with the Special Mandatory Redemption.

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested
by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of Charged Property securing the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Transaction Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above
shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee
(unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to

174


-----

request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which
circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such
release complies with the Indenture; provided that with respect to the release of the Security Interests over the
assets subject to the Escrow Charge, the Trustee shall only be entitled to receive (i) in connection with the
Escrow Release, the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate or (ii) in connection with the Special Mandatory
Redemption, a notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption, in each case, as described under “—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On or following certain public equity offerings (an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with
respect to the release of Security Interests if required to implement such IPO Event), the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement provide (and the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the
Issuer shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent) that the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the Transaction
Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice) as described under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—Provisions
_Following an IPO” (an “IPO Debt Pushdown”). Following such notice, among other things, the Group would_
comprise of the member of the Group or holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are
to be sold pursuant to such IPO Event, subject to certain limitations while the Notes are outstanding or in certain
other circumstances (the “IPO Pushdown Entity”) and its restricted subsidiaries and the Indenture will include
provisions to provide for substitution of the IPO Pushdown Entity as issuer to the extent permitted in accordance
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Any Parent Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
would not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the other Notes Documents and any security over its
assets may be released or if a Guarantor, its Notes Guarantee may be released, in each case, in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any
amendment to the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the
Transaction Security Documents (in the case of the Security Agent) required by the Issuer, enter into any
document or instrument in connection therewith and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer in order
to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement; provided that such
amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not impose personal obligations on the Trustee or
the Security Agent, or affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunity of the Trustee or the
Security Agent under such amendment, release or replacement or other document or instrument.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes
are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in
whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium with respect to the Notes as of, and accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem an aggregate
principal amount of Notes not to exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer from one or more Equity
Offerings or a contribution to the Issuer’s common share capital made with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more
Equity Offerings, at a redemption price equal to % of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date; provided that:

(1) the aggregate principal amount redeemed shall not exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes);

(2) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the
Indenture on the Issue Date (excluding Additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the
occurrence of each such redemption (unless all Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently); and

(3) each such redemption occurs not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity Offering.

175


-----

At any time and from time to time prior to 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, during each calendar
year redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes of the same
series), upon giving notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 103.000%
of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to but excluding the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes
in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the
percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
on the Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on of the year indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

_Other Redemption Terms_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender
offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to
redeem all Notes of such series, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer
plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. Without prejudice to any provision of the
Indenture regarding Notes deemed not be outstanding for voting purposes if held by the Issuer or its Affiliates, in
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or
managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the
purposes of such tender offer and such determination.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes (other than a Special Mandatory Redemption) may, at the Issuer’s
discretion, be given prior to the completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of
Indebtedness, a Change of Control, an Asset Disposition or other transaction) and any redemption may, at the
Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a
related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after
the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or
waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may
be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in
its sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed, or
that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or
all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that
payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and,
subject to the requirements of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, a single notice of redemption may be delivered with
respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions
made pursuant to different provisions will have the same or different redemption dates.

176


-----

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the
redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date
in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes
or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

Except as described under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuer
is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under
“—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” As
market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders, their respective Affiliates
and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or
loans, including the Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in privately negotiated or open market
transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements
governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the
incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts
involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such
purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant
reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Selection and Notice**

In the event that any global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, the Relevant Clearing System, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such global Note. The redemption price payable in connection
with the redemption of such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by the Relevant Clearing
System, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such global Note (or any portion thereof).

Under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed
at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a pro rata basis (such
as by way of a pool factor), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate and in accordance
with their applicable procedures (unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange rules); provided,
_however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the_
Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, the Notes will be selected on a pro rata basis, subject to
adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption;
_provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of any Notes_
below €100,000. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under
this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least
10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or
mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a legal or covenant
defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the
rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders of the
Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change in the principal
amount of Notes outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. When the Notes are held in certificated form, a new Note

177


-----

in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder
thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. When the Notes are held in the form of global notes, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Note (or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of the
Relevant Clearing Systems) to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained
therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption
date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or
portions of them called for redemption.

Except as otherwise required under the Indenture, the Issuer may elect to redeem or repurchase one or more
series of Notes or a portion of a series of Notes without redeeming any other series of Notes.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at its discretion upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional
Amounts, as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes,” if any, then due and which will become due on the
Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a
result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below under “—Withholding
_Taxes”) affecting taxation; or_

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such
laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect
of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts (or increased Additional Amounts) with respect to
the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by
the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts),
and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in
Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later
date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to
make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor
Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such
successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of
Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem
have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor
taking reasonable measures available to it (but in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and (b) a written opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized
standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely

178


-----

conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding
on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of any Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear
of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If
any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made by any
Payor or by the Paying Agent on behalf of any Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
“Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration
thereof to be made from any payments made by any Payor or by the Paying Agent on behalf of any Payor, with
respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of principal, redemption
price, interest or premium, if any, such Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts
(the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such
payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such
Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such
payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant
Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident
or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of
management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding,
in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or
the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a
Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to
the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before payment from which
any such withholding or deduction is required would be payable), to provide certification, information,
documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such
beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement
relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice
of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all
or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally
entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment
(where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30
days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

179


-----

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, capital gains, excise taxes, personal property or similar
Taxes imposed on any Note or the transfer thereof;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474
of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official
interpretations thereof or similar law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement
relating thereto;

(7) any U.S. federal back-up withholding tax under section 3406 of the Code;

(8) any U.S. federal withholding taxes that would not have been imposed or withheld but for the beneficial
owner being or having been a foreign or domestic personal holding company, a passive foreign
investment company or a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the United States, or a
corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such other
reasonable evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a
copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will
be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any
Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional
Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45
days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments
are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such reference
shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration,
court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest
or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance,
delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the
Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (in each case, other than in connection with a
transfer after this offering) and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise
from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or
levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8) (save that in respect of clause (5),
this proviso shall not apply in connection with transfer, personal property or similar Taxes).

180


-----

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for
tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any
Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a Change of
Control Offer or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption
notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph under this heading
“—Change of Control,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (provided that Notes of
€100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer
described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of
repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding
interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such
record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the
Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance
with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems or by first-class mail, with a copy to the
Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in
accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems, describing the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase
price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from
the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such
notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as
described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC
will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would entitle each lender under the
Senior Term Facilities Agreement (individually) and each lender under the ABL Facility Agreement
(individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of amounts outstanding to it under the Senior
Term Facilities Agreement or the ABL Facility Agreement, as applicable, and could trigger a change of control
under other financing arrangements of the Group. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries may contain
prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to
repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does
not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds
will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain
circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control

-----

under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise
affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are
contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the_
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in
such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders
protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption
of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,”
unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the
redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable
redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer
may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transaction shall not be prohibited by the covenants below under
“—Certain Covenants.”

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) a series of Notes has achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

(the occurrence of such events, a “Covenant Suspension Event” and the date thereof being referred to as the
“Suspension Date”), then, beginning on the Suspension Date until the occurrence of the Reversion Date (as
defined below), (i) the amount of each basket set by reference to a monetary amount for which a specific amount
is set out in the Indenture and any definitions used therein (including all “annual,” “life of facilities”, “fiscal
_year”, “financial year”, “calendar year”, “at any time” and “aggregate” baskets) shall be increased by 50% and_
(ii) the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this offering memorandum will no longer be
applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

   - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

   - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

   - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

182


-----

   - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

   - the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iv) under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”;

   - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

   - “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

   - “—Impairment of Security Interest.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Issuer may not designate any of its
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to
the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any
period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes no
longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or
downgrades the rating assigned to the relevant series of Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case,
to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to
future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this
description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note Guarantees (other than the Note Guarantee of the Issuer) will
be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event,
the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Dispositions shall be reset to zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the
extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) and any
Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though such
applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for
purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens”
definitions and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or
Event of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or have
occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended
Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments (as defined
herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated
as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect
prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Applicable Transaction entered into
during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period
(or deemed incurred or issued in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension
Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”; (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such
reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be
permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Affiliate Transactions”; (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any_
action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension_
Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”; (5) no Subsidiary of the
Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of
_Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation_
entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made during the
Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the
Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (i) of the definition of “Permitted
_Investments.”_

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default,
Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note
Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear

183


-----

any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any
time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a
failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the
Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the
Suspension Period) and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be
permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any
contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that any series of Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade
Rating. The Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event and a Reversion Date; provided that no
such notification shall be a condition for the Covenant Suspension Event to be effective. The Trustee shall have
no duty to (i) monitor the ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion
Date have occurred or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided that the Issuer and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the Applicable Test Date and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), either: (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is
at least 2.00:1.00 or (ii) the Total Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 8.00:1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(i) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit
Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the sum of:

(A) the aggregate of:

EBITDA; plus

(B) the greater of (x) €215.00 million and (y) an amount equal to 100% of LTM EBITDA; plus

(C) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, on the Applicable Test Date after
giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not
exceed 4.90:1.00; plus

(D) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that constitutes Total Secured Debt that is not Senior
Secured Indebtedness such that, on the Applicable Test Date after giving pro forma effect to such
Incurrence, either:

(1) the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 5.50:1.00; or

(2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is at least 2.00:1.00; plus

(E) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is not Senior Secured Indebtedness or Total Secured
Debt, or is unsecured such that on the Applicable Test Date, after giving pro forma effect to such
Incurrence, either:

(2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is at least 2.00:1.00,

deemed to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (i) may be refinanced at any time if such refinancing does
not exceed the greater of (x) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred
pursuant to this clause (i) on the Applicable Test Date for such refinancing and (y) the aggregate
principal amount of the Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness being

Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing) and, in the case of a refinancing of
Indebtedness under Facility B (EUR), Facility B (USD) and the ABL Facility, such Indebtedness shall
be treated for all purposes as Incurred pursuant to clauses (A)(1), (A)(2) and (A)(3) above,

the relevant Restricted Payment provisions under the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or pursuant to the relevant Permitted Payment provisions

For purposes of determining compliance with, and without prejudice to the section “—Financial and Other
_Calculations,” and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, and in_
compliance with, this covenant:

(i) subject to clause (ii) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness (or any
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to
be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and will only be required to
include, in any manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness (or
any portion thereof) in the first paragraph of this covenant or one of the clauses of the second
paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely
by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such
provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(ii) all Indebtedness under Facility B and the ABL Facility in each case outstanding as of the Acquisition
Closing Date (and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) shall be deemed to have been
Incurred pursuant to:

(A) clause (i)(A)(1) of the second paragraph of this covenant, in the case of Indebtedness under
Facility B (EUR);

(B) clause (i)(A)(2) of the second paragraph of this covenant, in the case of Indebtedness under
Facility B (USD); and

(C) clause (i)(A)(3) of the second paragraph of this covenant, in the case of Indebtedness under the
ABL Facility;

and the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or a portion of such Indebtedness;

(iii) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred
under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or
“clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this
covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of
any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(iv) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay the aggregate amount of

189


-----

accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees
or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums
and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(v) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(vi) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or the
second paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(vii) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(viii) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to
Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (cc) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or
issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating any
Applicable Metric for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation
of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) may be determined, at the Issuer’s option
(A) on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or
(B) on the date on which such facility or commitments become available or, if applicable, any other
Applicable Test Date (assuming, in the case of (A) and (B) of this clause (viii) that the full amount
thereof (or, at the option of the Issuer, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) and, in
either case, if any such Applicable Metric is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing
or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Applicable Metric at the time of
any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause
(viii) but not actually borrowed on such date shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such
date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the
Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of
any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and
outstanding under such clauses);

(ix) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph of this covenant or any
clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM
EBITDA as of the Applicable Test Date, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM
EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the
Applicable Test Date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be
deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of
accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees
or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums
and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing; and

(x) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the
principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on
the basis of GAAP.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the
payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not previously treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP,
will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this

190


-----

covenant; provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness
may (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest,
accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such
Increased Amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or
threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is
not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness denominated
in a given currency, the Currency Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (or liquidation
preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) denominated in another currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, or,
at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first incurred or upon execution of the definitive documentation in
respect thereof (whichever yields the lower Currency Equivalent); provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in another currency, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable currency denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such currency denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not
to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount (or liquidation
preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) set forth in sub-clause (c) of the definition of
“Refinancing Indebtedness”.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Issuer shall not permit any Guarantor to, and no Guarantor shall Incur any Indebtedness that is or
purports to be contractually subordinated (either by its terms or the terms of the agreement governing such
Indebtedness) in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness ranks
_pari passu with such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or is also contractually subordinated (either by its terms or the_
terms of the agreement governing such Indebtedness) in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee;
_provided that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other_
Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured
with different collateral or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting
different tranches of the Notes or where such ranking or subordination arises as a matter of law; provided,
_further, that this limitation shall not apply to distinctions between categories of Senior Indebtedness that exist by_
reason of any Liens or Guarantees or the ordering of payment for any Liens or by virtue of being secured on a
junior-priority basis (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Indebtedness incurred under the ABL Facility or
any asset-backed loan facility or other facility secured on the Collateral on a junior-ranking basis to such Senior
Indebtedness); provided in addition that and that Indebtedness under a Credit Facility that is Senior Indebtedness
of a Guarantor may provide for an ordering of payments among the tranches of such Credit Facility.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(i) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s or any Restricted
Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any such payment in connection with any merger or
consolidation involving the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries) except:

Contribution”);

(2) any net proceeds described in sub-clause (1) above shall be excluded for purposes of
increasing the amount available for distribution pursuant to clause (C) of this paragraph
below and shall not be Excluded Contributions; and

(3) in the case that any net proceeds described in sub-clause (1) above are contributed to or
received by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries in the form of Indebtedness, there shall

in each case, due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement and (B) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (iii) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(iv) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on or with respect to, or purchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other
than any payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Funding); or

(A) above shall not be paid to such Parent Entity in cash but instead be converted into an
intercompany loan made by such Parent Entity to the Issuer which constitutes Subordinated
Liabilities, save to the extent otherwise agreed by the Agent.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant and without prejudice to the section
“—Financial and Other Calculations,” in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) (i) meets the
criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in the second paragraph of this
covenant, and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or (iii) constitutes a
Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion

198


-----

thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such
reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with
this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the Applicable
Test Date of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment,
property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or otherwise
acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any of the Issuer’s Restricted
Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates
thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the
Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer), and the Parent will not, directly or indirectly, create, incur, or suffer to exist any Lien
upon the Charged Property owned by it, in each case, whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that
date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such
Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except:

(i) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Charged Property:

(A) Permitted Liens; or

(B) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if obligations under the Notes and the
Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, prior to in the case of Subordinated
Indebtedness, or, in the case of Liens with respect to Senior Indebtedness (at the Issuer’s option),
junior to, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured; and

(ii) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Charged Property, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (i)(B) of the first paragraph of this covenant
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial
Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or under
the relevant Transaction Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(i) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way
of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the
shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

199


-----

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions, with a purchase price in excess of
the greater of (x) €32.25 million and (y) an amount equal to 15% of LTM EBITDA, except in the case
of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Disposition, together with
all other Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalent Investments; and provided
that the amount of:

(A) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the
Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes
thereto or, if Incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities
that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated
balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior
to the date of such balance sheet, as determined by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are
(1) assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer)
pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such liabilities or (2) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the
transaction;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer acting in
good faith to be converted by Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalent
Investments (to the extent of the Cash Equivalent Investments received or expected to be
received) or by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalent Investments within 180
days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; and

(C) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Disposition having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (C) that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) €53.75 million and (y) an amount equal to 25% of
LTM EBITDA at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (or, at the
Issuer’s option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), with the fair
market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall each be deemed to be
Cash Equivalent Investments for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose; and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied, to the
extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (at its sole discretion):

(A) to prepay, repay or purchase:

(1) any Senior Indebtedness; and/or

(2) any other Permitted Debt (provided that such application would comply with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”),

(in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(B) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in
Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received
by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary); and/or

(C) to make any Restricted Payment or Permitted Payment permitted to be made under the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or any Permitted Investment,

in each case, within 635 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of
such Net Available Cash; provided that:

(1) in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to sub-clause
(iii)(A) above, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will
cause the related commitment (if any) (other than in the case of any asset-based credit facility
(including the ABL Facility) or any revolving credit facility (including a Revolving Facility)) to
be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased;

200


-----

(2) a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 635th day shall be treated
as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment or letter of
intent so long as the Issuer, or such Restricted Subsidiary, enters into such commitment or letter of
intent with the good faith expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such
commitment or letter of intent within the later of such 635th day and 180 days of such
commitment or letter of intent (an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the event any Acceptable
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Available Cash is
applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another
Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or
termination; provided, further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for
any reason before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall
constitute Excess Proceeds; and

(3) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with
sub-clauses (iii)(A) to (iii)(C) above or otherwise in accordance with this covenant, the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net
Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The following amount of Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture:

(i) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset
Disposition exceeds 4.65:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset
Disposition; or

(ii) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset
Disposition exceeds 4.40:1.00 but does not exceed 4.65:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 50% of the Net
Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; or

(iii) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset
Disposition does not exceed 4.40:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 0% of the Net Available Cash from such
Asset Disposition; provided that:

(A) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any
amount of Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no less than 100% of the principal
amount thereof, to the extent the creditors in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (including
the Holders) elect not to tender their Pari Passu Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or
purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to
such amount not tendered under this clause (A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of
Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the fourth
paragraph of this covenant, the “Declined Proceeds”); and

(B) for the avoidance of doubt, Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant
to clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph above shall be immediately available to the Group for any
purposes permitted by the Indenture, including to make Restricted Payments in accordance with
clause (xxiv) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments,” without regard to the periods specified in clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this_
covenant.

On the 636th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of
an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under
this covenant exceeds the greater of (x) €103.25 million and (y) an amount equal to 25% of LTM EBITDA in a
single transaction, the Issuer will within 10 Business Days make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all
Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other Pari Passu Indebtedness, to the
holders or lenders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or
accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the
Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to (i) in the case of the Notes, 100% of the principal
amount thereof (or accreted value, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the
closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and (ii) in the case of such
other Pari Passu Indebtedness, the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness.

201


-----

The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset
Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the expiration
of the relevant 635 days (or such longer period provided above) (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”) with
respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by
the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes tendered and other Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders or lenders thereof exceeds the amount offered in
the Asset Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall prepay,
repay or purchase the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis (or
otherwise in accordance with the Relevant Clearing System) based on the aggregate principal amount (or
accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with
adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in
part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer),
the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Disposition Offer shall be reset
to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon
consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be
deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the
Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the amount offered
in the Asset Disposition Offer (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for any purposes not
otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all
of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary
(to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including
financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors),
(y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or
another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material
adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, or (z) a contribution or distribution
of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or to a Restricted
Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is subject to a contractual encumbrance or
restriction affecting the distribution and such encumbrance or restriction is not prohibited by the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”, the portion of such
Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees (but the
Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by
the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer
satisfies certain conditions.

The provisions under the Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro, such
Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent amount
determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period.

-----

The Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the ABL Facility Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future
credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer or another member of the Group becomes a party may
prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is
prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of the lenders under such agreements to
the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer
does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In
such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default (subject to the
relevant grace periods and other provisions described under “—Events of Default” below) under the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any transaction or
series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of
any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x) €21.50 million and (y) an
amount equal to 10% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x)
€32.25 million and (y) an amount equal to 15% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate
Transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer;
_provided that any Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth_
in this clause (ii) if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors
of the Issuer, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(i) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments” or any Permitted Investment;_

(ii) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation
rights plans, participation plans, transaction bonuses or transaction-related securities repurchase plans
or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred
compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or
indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board

(B) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the

agreement to which the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the

whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreements or the Indenture, together with any security documents associated therewith, and (B) the
Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date (or the closing date of the
respective Senior Secured Facilities Agreements (as applicable)) or (ii) as is customary in comparable

-----

encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to

in clauses (i) to (xiv) of this paragraph or this clause (xv) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (i) to (xiv) of this
paragraph or this clause (xv); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect
to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in
any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement
or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate
fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the
Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of
the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of “Permitted
_Payments” or “Permitted Investments,” as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if_
the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of
an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary
if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee
on the date of such designation by delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

If the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary fails to meet the requirements
set out in the preceding paragraph, such Subsidiary shall not be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the
Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by it as a Restricted Subsidiary
as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is prohibited from being Incurring as of such date under the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer will be in default of such covenant.

The Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided
that such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any
outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such
Indebtedness is not prohibited under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including
pursuant to clause (v) of the second paragraph thereof treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the
purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as at the Applicable Test Date; and (2) no Event of
Default would be in existence immediately following such designation. Any designation of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer shall be evidenced to the Trustee by delivering to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports following
the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) after the
end of each fiscal year of the Issuer (or, in the case of the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date,

(unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (2) or (3)
of the first paragraph of this covenant); provided that such pro forma financial information will be
provided only to the extent reasonably available and without unreasonable expense, in which case the
Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iv) a brief
description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate
transactions and a description of all material debt instruments and (v) a summary description of any

footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the
Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations (other than the Acquisition) that have occurred since the beginning of the most

information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to this clause (2) or clause (3) of the first
paragraph of this covenant); provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only
to the extent reasonably available and without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will
provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) an operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated
financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital
resources of the Issuer and (iv) material recent developments; provided that the information described
in clause (iv) may be provided in the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer of the Issuer or a
change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long
as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the
Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under any
incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) shall be on a basis
consistent with GAAP as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of
GAAP as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be
described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may,
in the event of a change in GAAP, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need
include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the
results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure. In addition, the reports set forth above will not
be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

209


-----

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s pro forma consolidated revenue or
LTM EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this covenant will
include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as
to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such
annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the
SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English translation.

Subject to compliance with the next subsequent paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock
Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) and the Issuer or such Parent
Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities
admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to
issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock
Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange (or
one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) pursuant to such admission and disclosure
standards (or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as
applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements require the
Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other
reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets
of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York
Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this
covenant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial
statements under this covenant by providing (x) any report or financial statements of (i) any IPO Entity or
(ii) any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer so long as such reports (if an annual or quarterly report) meet
the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Issuer
therein were references to the IPO Entity or such Parent Entity; (y) any report or financial statements of
(i) German Newco or (ii) a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Issuer that represents substantially all the assets of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (any entity under sub-clause (y), a “Reporting Subsidiary”) or
(z) Person in respect of which financial statements or reports are provided to the agent under the Senior Term
Facilities Agreement in compliance with the information undertakings thereunder (any such entity, the “SFA
Reporting Entity” and together with the Issuer, a Reporting Subsidiary or any entity under sub-clauses (x), a
“Financial Reporting Entity” (as determined at the sole discretion of the Issuer)) so long as such reports (if an
annual or quarterly report) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant
as if references to the Issuer therein were references to the Reporting Subsidiary. Upon complying with the
requirements set forth in the preceding sentence, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in this covenant.

For purposes of this covenant and any determination or calculation to be made under the Indenture, the
Issuer may use financial statements of any Financing Reporting Entity (or a predecessor thereof) for reporting or
making calculations under the Indenture.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or
knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Charged Property (it being understood that (i) the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral
Liens or the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the Charged Property, (ii) the
occurrence of or implementation or any step in the Transaction or any Permitted Transaction and (iii) the
implementation of an IPO Pushdown shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security
Interest with respect to the Charged Property) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Parent and
the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than
the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the
Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any
interest in any of the Charged Property that is prohibited by the covenants described under “—Limitation on
_Liens”; provided, that the Parent, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the_
Charged Property that is not prohibited by the covenants described under “—Limitation on Liens”, including
Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Charged Property may be discharged, transferred or released in any
circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security
Documents.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge,
transfer or release of any Charged Property or Lien in any circumstance in accordance with the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Transaction Security Documents.
Subject to the foregoing, the Transaction Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency therein; (2) for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens; (3) to add to the Charged
Property; (4) for the purposes of undertaking any Permitted Transaction, a Permitted Tax Restructuring, an IPO
Pushdown, the Transaction and/or a transaction not prohibited by the covenants described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation,” (5) to make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material_
respect; or (6) to amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, replace or otherwise modify or release any
Transaction Security Documents followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over
the same assets; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (5) and (6) above, no Transaction Security
Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or
released unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement supplement,
replacement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets), the Issuer delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (i) a solvency
opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an
Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms the
solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (ii) a certificate from the chief
financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person
granting any such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets) or (iii) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications
customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Transaction Security
Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced, modified or released (followed by
an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) are valid and perfected Liens
not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien
or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, replacement, modification or release and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted
Collateral Lien is not subject.

-----

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and customary
protections and indemnifications) consent to such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and the Guarantee Limitations, the Issuer
shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, other than a Guarantor or a Securitization Subsidiary, to Guarantee
the payment of (i) any syndicated Credit Facility or (ii) Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor in an
aggregate principal amount in excess of the greater of (x) €53.75 million and (y) 25% of LTM EBITDA at such
time, unless:

(i) such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor within 60 days after the guarantee of such
Indebtedness; and

(ii) if applicable, executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Note
Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, which will be senior or pari passu with, as applicable, such
Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness, except that (i) with respect to a
guarantee or Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Note Guarantee may be expressly
subordinated and rank junior in right of payment to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such
other Indebtedness to the same extent as the Notes Guarantees are to such Indebtedness being
guarantee and (ii) with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, if such
Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s
Note Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness
shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee substantially to the same extent as
such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall be obligated to become
a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee of the Facilities is contrary to the
Agreed Security Principles or the Guarantee Limitations or could give rise to or result in:

(i) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, liquidity impairment rules, guidance
and coordination rules, retention of title claims or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous
restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction;

(ii) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that
is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or

(iii) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out
of pocket expenses.

At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including the Guarantee
Limitations and those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, capital maintenance, liquidity impairment or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting
the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law (including any usury laws).

The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a
Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60-day
period described in this covenant. The Indenture will provide that this covenant shall not be applicable to any
guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and
was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Note
_Guarantees—Note Guarantee Releases.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of the Issuer if, at the date of such release, there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which
was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at
the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The validity and
enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be

212


-----

subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Corporate
_benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the_
_Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral” and_
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of: (i) any Indebtedness secured on Charged Property or as otherwise
required or not prohibited herein; and (ii) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in
sub-clause (i) above, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall
enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the
existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not
materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect
to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests, provided that: (A) such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the
rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if more than one such intercreditor
agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error
or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement
(including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes and the Note
Guarantees); (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes); (v) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of the Charged Property to secure Additional Notes; (vi) to facilitate a Permitted Tax Restructuring, a
Permitted Reorganization or the Transaction; (vii) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens; (viii) amend the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; or
(ix) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole)
in any material respect making all necessary provisions to ensure that the Notes and the Note Guarantees are
secured by Liens of equivalent priority over the Charged Property.

The Indenture will also provide that the Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to
enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, other than:
(i) in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant; (ii) with the consent of the requisite majority of
Holders except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or (iii) as otherwise permitted
by such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the
Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the
Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the requisite majority of
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of
any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby, provided that such transaction would comply with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial and Other Calculations_**

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding for the avoidance of doubt Excess Cash Flow) in the Note Documents, including when
determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Period (including the portion
thereof occurring prior to any relevant Purchase (as defined below)), the Issuer may: (a) if during such period any
member of the Group (by merger or otherwise) has made or committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise)
to make an Investment in any person that thereby becomes (or that the Issuer expects in good faith, based upon
such commitment, will become) a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise has acquired or committed (unilaterally,
conditionally or otherwise) to acquire any entity, business, property or material fixed asset (including the
acquisition, opening and/or development of any new site or operation) (any such Investment, acquisition or
commitment (including under a letter of intent) therefor, a “Purchase”), including any such Purchase occurring in
connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made under this Agreement or the other Finance
Documents, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for such period on the basis that the earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis)
attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Purchase during such Relevant Period shall be included as
if the Purchase occurred on the first day of such Relevant Period; and/or (b) include an adjustment in respect of
any Purchase and/or any steps taken or committed or expected to be taken (in each case, unilaterally,
conditionally or otherwise) in respect of such Purchase up to the amount of the pro forma increase in
Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Company (in good faith) after taking into account the full “run rate”
effect of: (i) all Synergies which the Company (in good faith) determines have been or will be achieved (in full or
in part) at any time during such Relevant Period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Purchase or any
related steps, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant Period and already
included in Consolidated EBITDA, provided that so long as such Synergies have been or will be realized at any
time during such Relevant Period, it may be assumed they were realized during the entirety of such Relevant
Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) believes can be achieved within following the
end of such period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Purchase or any related steps (the “ForwardLooking Purchase Synergies”), provided that so long as such Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies will be
realizable at any time during such Look-Forward Period, it may be assumed they will be realizable during the
entire such period; in each case, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant Period
and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (c) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses
directly or indirectly related to the Purchase.

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding for the avoidance of doubt Excess Cash Flow) in the Note Documents, including when
determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Period (including the portion
thereof occurring prior to any relevant Sale (as defined below)), the Issuer may: (a) if during such period any
member of the Group has disposed or committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to make a disposal of
any person, property, business or material fixed asset or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a
business sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Group (any such sale, transfer, disposition or
commitment therefor, a “Sale”) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate Consolidated EBITDA
relates to such a Sale, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for such period on the basis that Consolidated EBITDA
will be reduced by an amount equal to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and
impairment (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if positive) attributable
to the assets which are the subject of such Sale for such period or increased by an amount equal to the earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated
EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if negative) attributable thereto for such period as if the Sale occurred on the first
day of such Relevant Period; and/or (b) include an adjustment in respect of any Sale and/or any steps taken or
committed or expected to be taken (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) in respect of such Sale
up to the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after
taking into account the full “run rate” effect of: (i) all Synergies which the Company (in good faith) determines
have been or will be achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such Relevant Period directly or indirectly as
a consequence of the Sale or any related steps, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the
Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA, provided that so long as such Synergies have
been realized at any time during such Relevant Period, it may be assumed they were realized during the entirety
of such Relevant Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) believes can be achieved
following the end of such period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Sale or any related steps (the
“Forward-Looking Sale Synergies”), provided that so long as such Forward-Looking Sale Synergies will be

214


-----

realizable at any time in the future, it may be assumed they will be realizable during the entire such period; in
each case, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant Period and already included in
Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (c) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or indirectly
related to the Sale.

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding for the avoidance of doubt Excess Cash Flow) in the Note Documents, including when
determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Period (including the portion
thereof occurring prior to implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative), the Issuer may:
(a) include an adjustment in respect of each Group Initiative and/or any steps taken or committed or expected to
be taken (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) in respect of such Group Initiative up to the
amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after taking
into account the full “run rate” effect of: (i) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) determines have been
or will be achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such Relevant Period directly or indirectly as a
consequence of implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative or any related steps, without
prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated
EBITDA, provided that so long as such Synergies have been realized at any time during such Relevant Period, it
may be assumed they were realized during the entirety of such Relevant Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which
the Issuer (in good faith) believes can be achieved following the end of such period directly or indirectly as a
consequence of implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative or any related steps (the
“Forward-Looking Group Initiative Synergies” and together with the Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies and
the Forward-Looking Sale Synergies, the “Forward-Looking Synergies”), provided that so long as such ForwardLooking Group Initiative Synergies will be realizable at any time in the future, it may be assumed they will be
realizable during the entire such period; in each case, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during
the Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (b) exclude any non-recurring fees,
costs and expenses directly or indirectly related to the implementation of, or commitment to, implement such
Group Initiative.

In relation to the definitions set out in the Indenture and all other related provisions of the Notes Documents
(including any Applicable Metric), all calculations in respect of Synergies (in each case actual or anticipated)
may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such Synergies were realized on the first day of the Relevant
Period.

Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income for any part of a Relevant Period falling prior to the
Issue Date shall be calculated on an actual basis over the Relevant Period (whereby for any part of the applicable
Relevant Period falling prior to the date on which the BIRKENSTOCK Group became part of the Group, such
amount shall be calculated based on actual historic data for the corresponding period available and by reference
to the BIRKENSTOCK Group as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and the other
provisions of the Indenture) or, at the Issuer’s option, on the basis of the final management case financial model.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in the
Indenture), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or component thereof but excluding
Excess Cash Flow, the Issuer shall be permitted to: (a) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other
negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from: (i) the Transaction;
(ii) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the impact
from purchase price accounting; (iii) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing
businesses; (iv) Restructuring Costs; (v) research and development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof);
and/or (vi) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases)
and, in each case, any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under the accounting principles) or
any other changes in the applicable accounting principles; and/or (b) include any addbacks (without further
verification or diligence) for adjustments (including anticipated Synergies) or costs or expenses related to the
Transaction and/or any base case model or quality of earnings report relating to a Permitted Acquisition prepared
by an independent third party and/or taken into account in determining “Adjusted EBITDA” or any financing
EBITDA to be used in connection with financing for a Permitted Acquisition and/or any research and
development expenditure (which is not otherwise capitalized).

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in
connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at the
option of the Issuer, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Issuer elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of

215


-----

any Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred
up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma calculation may exclude any
non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction; provided that the pro forma
calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that
(a) the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent
Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant
Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save as contemplated in clause (a) above,
compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant
Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date
would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied
with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable
Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such
fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event
of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date would
at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the
occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be
deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed not to have occurred or be continuing).

Subject to clause (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with any action or_
transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and prior to the
earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Issuer determines (in its sole
discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such Applicable Metric shall be
determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction.

If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed,
incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable
Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratiobased Applicable Metric, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence or drawing of any
Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other debt
which is available to be re-drawn (including under the ABL Facility, any Revolving Facility or any ancillary
facility under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements) and, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause
(viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, any undrawn
commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of
testing the Applicable Metric.

If, in connection with the same Applicable Transaction or otherwise substantially simultaneously: (a)(i) any
Applicable Metrics required to be determined by reference to a fixed currency amount or a percentage of LTM
EBITDA (a “fixed permission”) are intended to be utilized; and/or (ii) revolving Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness under the Reserved Indebtedness Amount) is intended to be Incurred; and (b) any Applicable
Metric required to be determined by reference to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio-based
Applicable Metric (a “ratio-based permission”) are intended to be utilized (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any determination of any increase or decrease in any such Applicable Metric, including in accordance with the
clauses (v)(B)(1)(I), (v)(B)(1)(II) or (v)(B)(1)(III) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”), then (x) amounts available to be incurred under the applicable ratio-based
permissions shall first be calculated without giving effect to amounts to be incurred under the applicable fixed
permissions or the applicable Incurrence of revolving Indebtedness, or amounts previously incurred under such
fixed permissions and not reclassified that are being repaid in connection with such Applicable Transaction,
unless otherwise elected by the Issuer; and (y) thereafter, compliance with any relevant fixed permissions shall

216


-----

be calculated, and in each case, full pro forma effect shall be given to all increases to LTM EBITDA and
repayments or discharges of Indebtedness in connection with such Applicable Transaction in accordance with
this Agreement.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical
permission”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower permission of the
Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of a Permitted Acquisition
or Permitted Investment, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the
grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such Permitted Acquisitions and/or Permitted
Investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one Applicable Metric, the Issuer
may (in its sole discretion), limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” classify and reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular
Applicable Metric and will only be required to include that amount or transaction in one of those Applicable
Metrics (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount may at the option of the Issuer be split between different
Applicable Metrics).

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is
incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under
a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a
portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

The Indenture will provide that references to (i) any matter being “permitted” under the Indenture or any
other Notes Document shall include references to such matters not being prohibited or otherwise being approved
under the Indenture or such other Notes Document and (ii) any transaction being in the “ordinary course of
business” of a member of the Group shall be construed to include any transaction that is consistent with industry
practice in the industries in which the Group operates or consistent with past practice of any member of the
Group or the BIRKENSTOCK Group.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant Period, a
four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during
such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive)
between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period (or any such other
preceding period as specified in such Applicable Metric) and the amount thereof actually used or
applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or
(B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and
the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such
corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during
such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry
Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period
prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back
Amount.

For the purpose of this section and to the extent any Applicable Metric is used as the basis (in whole or in
part) for permitting any transaction or making any determination under the Indenture (including on a pro forma
basis) no item shall be included or excluded more than once where to do so would result in double counting.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Issuer_**

Subject to the first paragraph under “—General” below, the Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with
or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to any person, unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the “Successor Company”) will be a person organized and
existing under the laws of the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Germany, the United States (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof) or a
Member State of the European Union, and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly
assume, by way of supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of
the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Transaction Security Documents and any other Notes Documents, as applicable;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Company
or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and immediately after giving effect to such transaction:

(A) the Issuer or the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”; or_

(B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower, or the Total Net Leverage Ratio would not
be higher, than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(iii) the Issuer or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer
and such supplemental indenture comply with the Indenture; provided that in giving an Opinion of
Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact; and

(iv) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially
equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods (or any similar or equivalent
concept)) guarantees and security over the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares
(or other interests) in the Issuer or the Successor Company, save to the extent such assets or shares (or
other interests) cease to exist (provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the Issuer cease to exist,
security will be granted (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares (or other interests)
in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture.

**_Guarantors_**

No Guarantor may:

(i) consolidate with or merge with or into any person;

(ii) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or
a series of related transactions, to any person; or

(iii) permit any person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(A) the other person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with the transaction); or

(B) either (x) the Issuer or a Guarantor is the continuing person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under the Indenture
and all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents, as applicable, and immediately after giving
effect to the transaction, no Event of Default is continuing; or

218


-----

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by
the Indenture.

**_General_**

The provisions set forth in this covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):

(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a
Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor;

(ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to
the Issuer or another Guarantor;

(iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the
surviving entity of such merger or consolidation:

(A) the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer (as applicable) under the Notes,
the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents and with respect to the Issuer, clauses (i), (iii)
and (iv) of the covenant described under “—The Issuer” above shall apply to such transaction; and

(B) to the extent that any Transaction Security previously granted over the shares in the capital of the
relevant Guarantor would not, in accordance with applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares
in the capital of the surviving entity, the direct Parent Holding Company of the surviving entity
shall, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, grant Transaction Security over the shares in the
capital of the surviving entity on substantially equivalent terms to any Security Interests granted
over the shares in the capital of such predecessor Guarantor immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation;

(iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated
or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity
in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided that, in the case of a
consolidation, merger or combination of:

(A) the Issuer into or with an Affiliate that is not a Guarantor, clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the
covenant described under “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; and

(B) any Guarantor into or with an Affiliate, sub-clause (iii) above shall apply to such transaction; or

(v) the Transaction or any Permitted Transaction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

This covenant shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, this covenant will not prohibit or restrict the
Transaction or any Permitted Transaction, in each case, which shall be expressly permitted under this covenant.

**Events of Default**

Subject to the two succeeding paragraphs, each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(a) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(b) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note when due at its
Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise,
continued for five Business Days;

219


-----

(c) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(d) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary, in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary and other than any default that may occur in respect of the Existing Debt on or prior to the
end of the Clean-up Period, whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the
date hereof, which default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a “payment
default”); or

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “crossacceleration provision”),

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness subject to such payment defaults
or accelerations (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), is in excess of the greater of (x)
€64.50 million and (y) an amount equal to 30% of LTM EBITDA;

(e) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Parent, the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”) which, in each case, are sanctioned by a court and become
unconditional and are not with a Creditor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (in its capacity as
such), the Trustee or the Security Agent;

(f) failure by the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the
greater of (x) €64.50 million and (y) an amount equal to 30% of LTM EBITDA, other than any
judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and
creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period
of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice from the Trustee) after such judgment becomes final, and
in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced
by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default
provision”);

(g) any Security Interest under the Transaction Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of
the greater of (x) €21.50 million and (y) an amount equal to 10% of LTM EBITDA shall, at any time,
cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Transaction
Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the
release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents or any
such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable
and any such Default continues for 30 days (the “security default provisions”); and

(h) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Note Guarantee of any one or more
Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or
invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any one or more Guarantors that is an
Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee (the
“guarantee default provisions”).

However, a Default under clauses (c), (d) or (f) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of
Default unless (i) the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes have notified the Issuer of the Default and (ii) the Issuer has not cured such Default within 60 days after
receipt of such notice; provided that notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken or
reported to the Trustee more than 2 years prior to such notice of Default. Any time period providing for the cure
of any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default described under the first paragraph of this section may be
extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of
Default is the subject of litigation.

220


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this
section) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee
(subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, subject to the provisions of the next paragraph,
declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon
such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately.
In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (d) has
occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the
event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to such clause (d) shall be
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event
of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration
with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Any notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an
Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of
Default under the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under
the first paragraph of this section or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default
the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a
“Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and
the Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is a Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant
Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not, Net
Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a
notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise
ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a
Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably
request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation
within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the
Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or
Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the
Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time,
in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (which
shall be provided to the Holders) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable
basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation or its
Verification Covenant and (ii) has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that
such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any
Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such
Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee
shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant,
(ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction
rules that such Directing Holder was, at such time, not in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification
Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification
Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such
Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the
percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been
insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with
the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration
rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such
alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting
and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has
satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder
Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the

221


-----

requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee
shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be
taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder
Direction (provided that the relevant Position Representations are provided in accordance with the provisions of
the preceding paragraph) or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without
verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein.

If an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section occurs and is continuing,
the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce
the Transaction Security Documents except as provided in such Transaction Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may
waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal,
premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only
be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant
titled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other
provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such
covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

On or prior to the end of the Clean-up Period, (i) none of the debt of the Group existing under the Existing
Debt or security relating thereto and (ii) no breach of representation, warranty, undertaking or other term of (or
default or event of default under) the Existing Debt arising as a direct or indirect result of the entry into or
performance of obligations under the Notes Documents shall constitute a breach of (or Default or Event of
Default) under any Notes Document.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce
the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to
the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy, and such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or
Verification Covenant;

(3) such Holders, or Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation (as applicable)
have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory
to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such
60-day period.

222


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses,
liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee
is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good
faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the
next succeeding Business Day) after the end of each fiscal year (or in the case of the first fiscal year ending after
the Issue Date, 150 days), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that
has occurred during the previous year, and is continuing. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within
30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events that are continuing of which it is aware the
occurrence of which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture and the other Note Documents may
be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any existing Default or Event
of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal or premium, Additional
Amounts, if any, or interest on any Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), except a payment
default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Indenture
and the other Note Documents may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one or
more series of Notes (but not all series of Notes), only the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes of the series so affected (and not the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding), shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (7) and (9) of
this paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes (provided, however, that if any
amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect one or more series of Notes
(but not all series of Notes), only the consent of the holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of clauses (7) and (9)
below, 80%) of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of the series so affected will be
required), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating to
a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any
such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption” and
“—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

223


-----

(5) impair the contractual right of any Holder of any outstanding Note to institute suit for the enforcement
of any payment of principal of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or
after the due dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of
such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder
unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Charged
Property (taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the provisions governing
a Change of Control, the release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the
benefit of the Holders in the Charged Property (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and any default
or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default
that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver or
modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the
Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency or reduce the minimum
denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person or a co-issuer of the obligations of the Issuer or a
Guarantor under any Note Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a Permitted
Transaction;

(3) add to the covenants, add an obligor or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
make any change (including changing the ISIN, common code, CUSIP or other identifying number on
any Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material
respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member
of senior management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes that may be issued in
compliance with the Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” to add Note Guarantees with
respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the
release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing
the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the
Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

224


-----

(7) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under any Debt Document of a successor
Trustee or successor security agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession
by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Note Document;

(8) in the case of the Transaction Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
Security Interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior
Secured Facilities Agreements, in any property which is required by the Transaction Security
Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the Charged
Property for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such Security Interest is not
prohibited by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied
with;

(9) conform the text of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Transaction Security Documents or
the Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this
“Description of the Notes” was intended to be a recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the
Transaction Security Documents or the Notes;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes
as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Notes;
_provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes_
being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such
amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(11) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(12) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and “—Merger and Consolidation”, relating to
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; and

(13) comply with the covenant described under “—Certain _Covenants—Additional_ _Intercreditor_
_Agreements”._

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” or this section shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights
of Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates
and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment, supplement or waiver of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance thereof. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder given
in connection with a sale or tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such sale or tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clauses (3) and (6) of the third paragraph of this section to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it
shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor
to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any
other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer, the
Trustee and the Security Agent (to the extent applicable).

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer, will be considered as though not
outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will be protected in relying on any
such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a responsible officer of the Trustee actually knows are so
owned will be so disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt, any Independent Debt Fund shall not be considered to

225


-----

be a Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the
Issuer.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Parent, the Issuer and the Guarantors under the
Note Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for
certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities
and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations
concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the
foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Transaction Security Documents and the rights
of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” and “—Merger and Consolidation” (other than clauses (i),
(iii) and (iv) of “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default
provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the crossdefault upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with
respect to the Issuer), the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision, and the security default provision
described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its
covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in clause (c), (d), (e) (other than with respect only to the Issuer), (f) or (g) under
“—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash_
in euro or European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if
any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided, that upon any redemption
that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated
as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the
“Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of
redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the
Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption, and (ii) must comply with certain other conditions,
including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders and
beneficial owners will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must
be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income
tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be

226


-----

of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated
and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for
payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice
of redemption by the Trustee or the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the
Trustee for this purpose) money in euro or European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof in an
amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date
of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date,
as the case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the
amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of satisfying and discharging the Indenture to the extent that an
amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to
the date of redemption, and any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that
such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be
paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer have delivered irrevocable instructions to the
Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the section of the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on
any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3)
and (4)).

If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, the Trustee will distribute any
amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided,
_however, that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier_
repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution
and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative
interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Note Documents or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the
view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

GLAS Trust Company LLC is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of
care that a prudent person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.
Furthermore, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request of any Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to
the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any

227


-----

such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions
with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and
(2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has actual knowledge that it has or has acquired a conflict of interest that is
not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer
may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may
petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. In formulating its decisions, the Trustee and
the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems
appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

**Notices**

If and for so long as Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be sent to the Authority.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as any Notes
are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to the Relevant Clearing Systems in
accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems, delivery of which shall be deemed
to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests.
To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems conflict with any such
requirements, a notice will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of the Indenture if it complies with the
mandatory rules and procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect
its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed in
the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given through a Relevant Clearing System, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to
such Relevant Clearing System.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years
after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the required currency (the “Required Currency”) of account and payment for all sums payable by the
Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, if any,
including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the applicable Required
Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the
winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder, any Paying Agent or by the

228


-----

Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a
discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the amount of the applicable Required
Currency which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency
on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first
date on which it is practicable to do so). If the amount of the applicable Required Currency is less than the
amount of the Required Currency expressed to be due to the recipient, any Paying Agent or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the
Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient, any Paying Agent or
the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this
currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note
or any Paying Agent or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the
sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a
separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a
separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note,
any Paying Agent or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full
force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum
due under any Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein,
for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent
amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application
to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Notes
thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a material portion of the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and
state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in the United States of
America. The Indenture will provide that each of the Issuer and the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service
of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees
brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the
avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The Transaction Security Documents (including the Escrow
Charge) will be governed by the law of the location of the relevant asset that is part of the Charged Property. For
the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of articles 470-1 to 470-19 (inclusive) of the Luxembourg law of
August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended, are expressly excluded.

Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any
Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the
average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the reference period except as set forth in the first paragraph
of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a
factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have
been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may
designate.

For the purposes of this definition, “Consolidated Interest Expense” will be calculated using an assumed

respect to such Indebtedness or, if no such indicative interest margin exists, as reasonably determined by the

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will initially
be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A
Global Notes”). The Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance
on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and together with the Rule 144A
Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with a
common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear
and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be
shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by
Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will only be issued
in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account
with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes
registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very
limited exceptions) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holder” of the Notes under the Indenture
for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable (or its respective nominee), will be considered the holder of the Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. As such, participants and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise
any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and
a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default (as defined under “Description of
_the Notes”) under the Indenture; or_

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to
be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued
in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in
accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

284


-----

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a
partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the
transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor
or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that a
Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to
protect us, the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which
any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for
expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance
with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer
restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any
of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner
thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will
be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is
a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of
the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will
be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance
with their respective operational procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent
will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, which will distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global
Notes (for example, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or their respective nominees) as the owner

285


-----

thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents has or will have
any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspects of the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments
made by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or
any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry
Interest;

   - payments made by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a
Book-Entry Interest;

   - Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant; or

   - the records of the custodian or common depositary, as applicable.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street
name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from
any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to
foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to
distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be done in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the
Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such

286


-----

transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any other exemption (if available under
the Securities Act). Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of
the Notes and the closing of the Offering (the “distribution compliance period”), Regulation S Book-Entry
Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold
interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be
permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities
Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to (i) a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting
the requirements of Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (ii) otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any
other jurisdiction.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest
in one of the Global Notes of any series that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a BookEntry Interest in the other Global Note of such series will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

In connection with transfers involving exchanges between Regulation S Book-Entry Interests and 144A
Book-Entry Interests, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
relevant Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the other relevant Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such
notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global
Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

287


-----

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on the Official
List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream
will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected
in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, they are
under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued
or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations
under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on
the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same
day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading
of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSEQUENCES**

**Luxembourg Income Tax Considerations**

The following summarizes certain important Luxembourg taxation principles that may be relevant to you if
you purchase, hold or dispose of the Notes. Unless otherwise indicated, all information contained in this section
is based on laws, regulations, practice and decisions in effect in Luxembourg at the date of this offering
memorandum. Any changes could apply retroactively or with a retrospective effect and could affect the
continued validity of this summary.

This summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all potential Luxembourg tax
considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and is not intended as
tax advice to any particular noteholder. This information also does not take into account the specific
circumstances of particular noteholders. Prospective noteholder should therefore consult their own professional
advisers as to the effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be
subject.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy,
impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or Luxembourg tax
law concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax generally encompasses
corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt commercial
communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax (impôt
sur le revenu des personnes physiques). Corporate taxpayers may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur
la fortune), as well as other duties, levies and taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax and the
solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes.
Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and a solidarity surcharge. Under certain
circumstances, where individual taxpayers act in the course of the management of a professional or business
undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

This overview assumes that each transaction with respect to the Notes is at arm’s length.

Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Luxembourg concepts, the
meaning to be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent
Luxembourg concepts under Luxembourg tax law.

The summary in this Luxembourg taxation paragraph does not address the Luxembourg tax consequences
for a holder of Notes who:

   - is an investor as defined in one of the following specific laws: the law of 11 May 2007 on family
wealth management companies, as amended, the law of 17 December 2010 on undertakings for
collective investment, as amended, the law of 13 February 2007 on specialised investment funds, as
amended, the law of 23 July 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds, as amended, the law of
22 March 2004 on securitization, as amended, the law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles, as
amended and the law of 13 July 2005 on pension saving companies and associations, as amended;

   - is, although in principle subject to Luxembourg tax, in whole or in part, specifically exempt from tax;

   - owns Notes in connection with a membership of a management board or a supervisory board, an
employment relationship, a deemed employment relationship or management role; or

   - has a substantial interest in the Issuer or a deemed substantial interest in the Issuer for Luxembourg tax
purposes. Generally, a person holds a substantial interest if such person owns or is deemed to own,
directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the shares or interest in an entity.

**_Tax residency_**

A noteholder will not become resident, nor be deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg solely by virtue of
holding and/or disposing of Notes or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of his/her rights
thereunder.

289


-----

**_Withholding tax_**

_Non-resident noteholders_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, payments of arm’s length interest (including accrued
but unpaid interest) and principal made to non-residents of Luxembourg in the context of the holding, disposal,
redemption or repurchase of the Notes which are not profit-sharing and which do not entitle the noteholder, on
top of a fixed interest coupon, to a supplementary interest coupon varying based on the profits distributed by the
debtor, will not be subject to any Luxembourg withholding tax.

_Resident noteholders_

Under the law of 23 December 2005 as amended (the “23 December 2005 Law”), payments of interest or
similar income made or ascribed by a Luxembourg paying agent to or for the benefit of certain individual
beneficial owners who are residents of Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding tax of 20% (the “20%
Withholding Tax”).

Pursuant to the 23 December 2005 Law, Luxembourg resident individuals acting in the course of the
management of their private wealth can opt to self-declare and pay a 20% tax (the “20% Self-Declared Tax”) on
interest payments made on or after 31 December 2007 by paying agents located in an EU member state other
than Luxembourg or a Member State of the EEA other than an EU member state.

The 20% Withholding Tax or the 20% Self-Declared Tax will be in full discharge of income tax if the
beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his or her private wealth.
Responsibility for the payment of tax in application of the 23 December 2005 Law is assumed by the
Luxembourg paying agent (in the case of the 20% Withholding Tax) and by the Luxembourg resident holder of
the Notes (in the case of the 20% Self-Declared Tax).

**_Taxation of the noteholders_**

_Income tax_

_Non-resident noteholders_

Non-resident noteholders, not having a permanent establishment, a permanent representative, or a fixed
place of business in Luxembourg to which or whom the Notes or income therefrom are attributable, are not
subject to Luxembourg income taxes on income accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts,
under the Notes nor on capital gains realized upon disposal, redemption, repurchase, sale or exchange, in any
form whatsoever, of any of the Notes.

Non-residents noteholders who have or are deemed to have a permanent establishment, a permanent
representative, or a fixed place of business in Luxembourg to which the Notes or income therefrom are
attributable are subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue
discounts, under the Notes and on any gains realized upon the sale or disposal of the Notes.

_Resident noteholders_

➣ _Individuals_

A resident individual acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking must
include any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with the Notes, such as interest
accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or
disposal in any form whatsoever, of the Notes, in its taxable income for Luxembourg income tax purposes.
Taxable gains are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including accrued
but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or redeemed.

A resident noteholder, acting in the course of the management of his or her private wealth, is subject to
Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest or similar income received (such as premiums or issue discounts)
under the Notes, except if a final withholding tax has been levied on such payments in accordance with the
23 December 2005 Law.

A gain realized by an individual noteholder, acting in the course of the management of his or her private
wealth, upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of Notes is not subject to Luxembourg income tax,
provided this sale or disposal took place after the acquisition of the Notes and more than six months after the
Notes were acquired.

290


-----

However, any portion of such gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income is subject to
Luxembourg income tax, except if a final withholding tax has been levied on such interest in accordance with the
23 December 2005 Law.

➣ _Corporations_

A corporate resident noteholder must include any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in
connection with the Notes, such as interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, as
well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes, in its taxable income for
Luxembourg income tax purposes. Taxable gains are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or
redemption price (including but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or
redeemed.

_Net wealth taxation_

Corporate noteholders resident in Luxembourg and non-resident corporate noteholders that maintain a
permanent establishment, permanent representative, or a fixed place of business in Luxembourg to which or to
whom such Notes are attributable are subject to an annual net wealth tax on their unitary value (i.e., non-exempt
assets minus liabilities and certain provisions as valued according to valuation rules), levied at a rate of 0.5% if
the unitary value does not exceed €500,000,000 and 0.05% on the portion of the unitary value that exceeds
€500,000,000, in respect of the Notes.

A minimum net wealth tax (“MNWT”) is levied for corporate noteholders resident in Luxembourg and
non-resident corporate noteholders mentioned above when the sum of fixed financial assets, receivables against
related companies, transferable securities and cash at bank exceed cumulatively 90% of the total balance sheet
and €350,000.

Corporate resident noteholders and non-resident corporate noteholders mentioned above which do not fall
within the scope of the €4,815 MNWT will be subject to a minimum net wealth tax that ranges between €535 and
€32,100.

Individuals are not subject to Luxembourg net wealth tax.

_Inheritance and gift tax_

Where Notes are transferred for non-consideration:

   - no Luxembourg inheritance tax is levied on the transfer of the Notes upon the death of a holder of
Notes in cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes;

   - by way of gift, Luxembourg gift tax will be levied in the event that the gift is made pursuant to a
notarial deed signed before a Luxembourg notary or is registered in Luxembourg.

Where a holder of Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes at the time of his/her
death, the Notes are included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes.

_Other taxes and duties_

It is not compulsory that the Notes be filed, recorded or enrolled with any court or other authority in
Luxembourg. No registration tax, transfer tax, capital tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or
duty is due in respect of or in connection with the issue of Notes, the performance by the Issuer of its obligations
under Notes, or the transfer of Notes.

A fixed or ad valorem registration duty in Luxembourg may however apply (i) upon voluntary registration
(présentation à l’enregistrement) of the Notes before the Registration and Estates Department (Administration de
_l’enregistrement, des domaines et de la TVA) in Luxembourg, or (ii) if the Notes are (a) enclosed to a compulsory_
registrable deed under Luxembourg law (acte obligatoirement enregistrable) or (b) deposited with the official
records of a notary (déposé au rang des minutes d’un notaire).

**_Value added tax_**

No Luxembourg value added tax is levied with respect to (i) any payment made in consideration of the
issuance of the Notes, (ii) any payment of interest, (iii) any repayment of principal or upon redemption, and
(iv) any transfer of the Notes. Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged

291


-----

for certain services rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are
rendered, or are deemed to be rendered in Luxembourg and an exemption from value added tax does not apply
with respect to such services.

**_Foreign account tax compliance act_**

To implement FATCA in Luxembourg, Luxembourg entered into a so-called Model 1 Intergovernmental
Agreement (the “Luxembourg IGA”) with the United States, and a memorandum of understanding in respect
thereof, on 28 March 2014. The Luxembourg IGA was implemented in Luxembourg domestic law by the
FATCA Law. The Luxembourg IGA and the FATCA Law may impose obligations on the Issuer and the
noteholders, if the Issuer is considered as a Reporting Financial Institution (e.g. an Investment Entity) under
FATCA, so that the latter could be required to conduct due diligence and obtain (among other things)
information or documentation, including self-certification forms, a global intermediary identification number, if
applicable, or any other valid evidence of a noteholder’s FATCA registration with the IRS or a corresponding
exemption, in order to fulfil its own legal obligations.

**_Common reporting standard_**

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has developed a new global standard for the
automatic exchange of financial information between tax authorities, the CRS. Luxembourg is a signatory
jurisdiction to the CRS and has conducted its first exchange of information with tax authorities of other signatory
jurisdictions in September 2017, as regards reportable financial information gathered in relation to fiscal year
2016. The CRS has been implemented in Luxembourg via the CRS Law.

The regulations may impose obligations on the Issuer and the noteholders, if the Issuer is considered as a
Reporting Financial Institution (e.g. an Investment Entity) under the CRS, so that the latter could be required to
conduct due diligence and obtain (among other things) confirmation of the tax residency, tax identification
number and CRS classification of noteholders in order to fulfil its own legal obligations.

**_Certain general income tax considerations—payments by Guarantors_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes, it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of
any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. Noteholders should consult
with their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a Guarantor makes any payments with respect to the
Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders (as
defined below) of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all potential tax effects. The summary does not address any U.S. federal income tax consequences to
Non-U.S. Holders relating to the Notes, nor does it address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than
U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any time,
possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences
described below. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be
sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not
take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes
than those discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the event of litigation. A different
treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or
loss, or otherwise result in adverse tax consequences, in respect of an investment in the Notes.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
U.S. Holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution
tax on net investment income, special tax accounting rules that apply as a result of gross income with respect to
the Notes being taken into account on an applicable financial statement, or to U.S. Holders subject to special
rules, such as banks, broker dealers, mutual funds, certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance

292


-----

companies, individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in
securities, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax exempt entities, regulated
investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, subchapter S corporations, or other pass
through entities or arrangements and investors in such entities or arrangements, persons liable for alternative
minimum tax, persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive
foreign investment companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax,
entities covered by the anti-inversion rules and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,”
“conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who
purchase the Notes in the offering hereby at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of
such Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers), and who hold the Notes as capital assets
(generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

If any entity or arrangement which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the
Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and
partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general information
purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax
consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S.
federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax
laws and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and the applicability of any applicable tax treaty.

**_IPO Debt Pushdown_**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described under “Description of
_the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the_
Debt Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things the Issuer (and all related provisions)
will now refer to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company
of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the indenture governing the Notes.
Such a modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed
exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such
modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange
could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners
of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. The amount of any gain or loss recognized upon such a
deemed exchange of a Note for a New Note would be determined by reference to the “issue price” of the New
Note. The issue price of a New Note will equal the fair market value of such Note or such New Note at the time
of the deemed exchange if, as seems likely, such Note or such New Note were considered “publicly traded” for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IPO Debt Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder’s holding period in a New Note treated as received in the IPO Debt
Pushdown generally will commence on the day after the IPO Debt Pushdown, and tax basis in such New Note
would generally equal the issue price of such New Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result of
such deemed exchange will be taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable
_Disposition of the Notes.” If the issue price of such New Note is less than its stated redemption price at maturity_
by more than a de minimis amount, such New Note will be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders would be required to include that original issue
discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. U.S.
Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to
modification of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax
considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting OID, if any.

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances (see, e.g., “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” “Description of_
_the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of the Notes—Withholding_
_Taxes”) we may be obligated or elect to pay amounts in excess of stated interest and principal on the Notes or the_
“issue price” (as defined below) of the Notes. Because of the possibility of such payments, the Notes may be

293


-----

treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury regulations, in which case the
timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the
consequences discussed herein. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the
possibility of such additional amounts payable on the Notes is a remote or incidental contingency within the
meaning of applicable Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, and thus does not result in the Notes being
treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination that
these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such holder explicitly discloses
to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position.
However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above,
among other adverse tax consequences, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue income on its Notes in excess of
stated interest and any otherwise applicable OID, and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any
income recognized on the taxable disposition of the Notes, and, with respect to a U.S. Holder of a Note, to
recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income in a manner different than that
described below. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisor regarding the tax consequences if the Notes were
treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The discussion below assumes that the Notes will not be treated
as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders of the Notes_**

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or any
entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in the United States or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) any estate the income of
which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) any trust if a court within the
United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United
States persons” (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust, or if the trust has a valid election in place to be treated as a “United States person” (as
defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code).

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, payments of stated interest on the Notes (as well as
any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld)
generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or
accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder of the Notes that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in
income the U.S. dollar value of the euro denominated interest payment on the Notes based on the spot rate of
exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on that
date. No foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the receipt of such payment
(other than foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the euro so received as described
under “—Exchange of Foreign Currency” below).

A U.S. Holder of the Notes that uses the accrual method of tax accounting (or who otherwise is required to
accrue interest prior to receipt) will accrue interest income on the Notes in euro and translate the amount accrued
into U.S. dollars based on:

   - the average spot rate of exchange in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof, within
such U.S. Holder’s taxable year; or

   - at such U.S. Holder’s election (a “Spot Rate Convention Election”), at the spot rate of exchange on
(1) the last day of the accrual period, or the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the
accrual period spans more than one taxable year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five
business days of the last day of the accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the
U.S. Holder to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to
which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and can be changed only with the
consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder of the Notes that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency
exchange gain or loss with respect to the Notes on the receipt of an interest payment equal to the difference
between (i) the value of the euro received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of

294


-----

exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on such
date, and (ii) the U.S. dollar amount previously included in income with respect to such payment. Such foreign
currency exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.
source, and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the Notes.

_Original Issue Discount_

If the issue price of the Notes is less than their stated principal amount by an amount greater than or equal to
a statutorily defined de minimis amount ( [1]⁄4 of one percent of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the
number of complete years to maturity from their original issue date), then the Notes will be considered to have
been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of OID on a Note generally is equal to
the excess of the Note’s stated principal amount over its issue price (as defined above).

If the Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder of a Note generally (i) will be required to include the OID
on the Note in gross income as ordinary interest income as such OID accrues on a constant yield basis over the
term of the Note, in advance of the receipt of the cash attributable to such OID and regardless of the U.S.
Holder’s method of accounting for tax purposes, but (ii) will not be required to recognize any additional income
upon the receipt of any cash payment on the Note that is attributable to previously accrued OID that has been
included in such holder’s income (except that such holder may be required to recognize foreign currency
exchange gain or loss, as described below).

The accrual of OID on a Note will be computed in euro, and the amount of accrued OID determined for any
accrual period then will be translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as accrued stated interest on a Note in
the hands of a U.S. Holder on the accrual basis, including the possible application of the Spot Rate Convention
Election. See “—Payments of Stated Interest” above.

Upon receipt of a payment attributable to OID on a Note (whether in connection with a payment on such
Note or the sale, exchange or other disposition of such Note), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such
payment (determined by translating any foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date of payment) and the
U.S. dollar amount of OID that such holder has previously included in income. Generally, any such foreign
currency exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest
income or expense, except to the extent provided in administrative pronouncements of the IRS. For this purpose,
all payments on a note will be viewed first as the payment of stated interest, second as the payment of previously
accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first, and
thereafter as the payment of principal.

_Foreign Tax Credits_

Any non-U.S. withholding tax with respect to the Notes held by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such
holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of
complex rules that depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits. Interest attributable to the Notes generally will be
income from sources outside of the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will
be considered passive category income or, in certain cases, general category income.

**_Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, except as noted
below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain
or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized by such U.S. Holder (except to the extent such
amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as described above under
“—Payments of Stated Interest”) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Note. Subject to the
discussion below, the adjusted tax basis of a Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the
euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase, increased by any OID
previously included in such U.S. Holder’s income in respect of such Note. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder
upon the disposition of a Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro received calculated at the spot
rate of exchange on the date of disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if the U.S.

295


-----

Holder’s holding period for the Note exceeds one year on the date of disposition. Long term capital gains
recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. Capital gain or loss, if any,
recognized by a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for purposes of calculating
the U.S. foreign tax credit limitation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax
accounting, and if it so elects, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting, will determine the
U.S. dollar values of its adjusted tax bases in a Note and the amount realized on the disposition of a Note by
translating euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition,
respectively. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders discussed above must be applied consistently
by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder of Notes that does not make the special election generally will recognize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange fluctuations between the disposition
date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is
attributable to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate during the period in which the U.S. Holder held
such Note. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of
the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date (1) the Note is disposed of (or the spot
rate on the settlement date, if applicable) and (2) of purchase (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if
applicable). In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a
U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to
previously accrued but unpaid interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated
_Interest.” The recognition of foreign currency exchange gain or loss described in this paragraph will be limited to_
the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of a Note, and will be treated as ordinary income
generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

**_Exchange of Foreign Currency_**

On a sale or other taxable disposition of foreign currency, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of U.S. dollars, or the fair market value in U.S.
dollars of other property, received by the U.S. Holder in the disposition and (ii) the holder’s tax basis in the
foreign currency. Any such gain or loss will be ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income
or expense, except to the extent provided by administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Foreign currency
received as interest on a Note or on the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will have a tax
basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time the foreign currency is received (except that foreign currency
received from the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is traded on an established securities
market will have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value on the trade date in the case of an accrual basis
taxpayer that does not make the election described above). Foreign currency that is purchased will generally have
a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of purchase.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Under applicable Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder who participates in “reportable transactions” (as
defined in the Treasury regulations) must attach to its U.S. federal income tax return a disclosure statement on
IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). The Treasury regulations could be interpreted to
cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under
the relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the Notes as a
reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the Treasury regulations. U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors to determine the tax reporting obligations, if any, including any requirement to file IRS
Form 8886, with respect to the ownership or disposition of the Notes or any related transaction such as the
disposition of any Euros received in respect of the Notes.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Payments of principal and interest on (including OID), and the proceeds of sale or other disposition of, the
Notes by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary may be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder as
may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments if the U.S.
Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to

296


-----

report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax returns. Certain U.S. Holders
are not subject to backup withholding. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for
exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals and who hold an interest in “specified foreign financial assets” (as
defined in section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes,
subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial
institutions). Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of the foregoing
rules. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their
ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“FATCA”)
generally impose a withholding tax (currently at a rate of 30%) on U.S. source interest income paid on a debt
obligation, certain foreign passthru payments and, subject to regulatory relief described below, on the gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a debt obligation, in each case, to (i) a foreign financial institution
(as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such institution enters into an
agreement with the United States government to collect and provide to the United States tax authorities
substantial information regarding United States account holders of such institution (which would include certain
equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with United
States owners) or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an
intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification
identifying the substantial U.S. owners of the entity, which generally includes any “United States person” (as
defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity, in each
case, unless another exemption applies; provided that such withholding tax would only apply with respect to
Notes if such interest income (or gross proceeds) are treated as passthru payments attributable to certain U.S.
source payments. U.S. Holders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the implications of
FATCA on their investment in the Notes.

Obligations that do not pay U.S. source interest issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date
on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published generally would be
“grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, for the Notes, if the relevant Issuer is
treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on such series of the Notes only if
there is a significant modification of the Notes of such series for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the
expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United
States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA
in a manner that may alter the rules described herein. Under proposed Treasury regulations that may be relied
upon pending finalization, the withholding tax on gross proceeds would be eliminated and, consequently,
FATCA withholding on gross proceeds is not currently expected to apply.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX
MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE
INVESTOR SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN
INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

_The Issuer is organized under the laws of Luxembourg and certain of the Guarantors are organized under_
_the laws of Luxembourg, Germany and the United States. Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on_
_the enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security interests, and a summary of certain insolvency law_
_considerations, in Luxembourg and Germany. This is a summary only, and bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar_
_proceeding could be initiated in Luxembourg, Germany, the United States and in the jurisdiction of organization_
_of a future guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger_
_disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights_
_and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the security interests on the Collateral._

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and Germany,
which are Member States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015
on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), and starting from June 26,
2017, which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the court which shall have jurisdiction to
commence main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company organized under the laws of a Member State is
the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main
interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where a
company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member
States may have differing and even conflicting views. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency
proceedings, which are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU
Insolvency Regulation.

The “centre of main interests” is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its “centre of main interests” in the Member
State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (which presumption shall not
apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the
request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the EU Insolvency
Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” shall be the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have
taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company in that
respect, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the
majority of its business or has its head office, and the location where the large majority of the company’s
creditors are established.

If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in a Member State in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be
entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency
Regulation. Insolvency proceedings initiated in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are
automatically recognized in the Member States (other than Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency
proceedings may be commenced in another Member State, subject to the conditions set out below.

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article
3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have
jurisdiction to open territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company
has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in
the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a
company carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of
territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an
establishment in such Member State in the three month period prior to the request for commencement of main
insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of
the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the

298


-----

debtor has its “centre of main interests” have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another
Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be
commenced in the Member State in which the company’s “centre of main interests” is situated under that
Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of
(i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within
the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial (secondary) proceedings is requested or
(ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the
establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial insolvency
proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the
local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.
Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the
territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have
jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them,
such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall
not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or
immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to
time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the
opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

   - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of
or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

   - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim
or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

   - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of
them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and

   - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a
Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s “centre of main
interest” is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another
Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain
limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no
preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings
in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court
of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the
main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in
such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to
open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of
third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the
sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove
assets of the company from that other Member State.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another
Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which
secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds
received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply
under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State.
Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local
creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking
is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall,
at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings
if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

299


-----

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months,
provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of
realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to
the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods.
Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in
the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the
secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by
the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order
to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of the group’s members. The EU
Insolvency Regulations provides

   - for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the
secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and insolvency practitioners;

   - for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient
administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same
group;

   - that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and

   - that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such
insolvency registers.

**_EU directive on preventative restructuring frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU)
2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on
June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs
that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable
them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit
from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and
(iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in
particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,
insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive
restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to
promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage,
when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most
notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual
enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation,
(b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of
interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c)
creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75%
of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of
affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may,
under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do
not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be
confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of
creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of
the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may
also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring.

-----

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by
July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for
which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July 17,
2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering
particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

In the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the
outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the
respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and
there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in
relation to one another.

**Luxembourg**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and as such any
insolvency proceedings applicable to such a company are in principle governed by Luxembourg law. The
insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Luxembourg. In the event that
the Issuer or any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would
be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and have their registered
office in Luxembourg. Accordingly, Luxembourg courts should have, in principle, jurisdiction to open main
insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer and such Guarantors, as entities having their registered office
and central administration (administration centrale) and center of main interests, as used in article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, in Luxembourg, such proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws.
According to the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its center of
main interests in the jurisdiction in which it has the place of its registered office. As a result, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the center of main interests of the Issuer and the Guarantors incorporated in Luxembourg is in
Luxembourg and consequently that any “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency
Regulation) would be opened by a Luxembourg court and be governed by Luxembourg law.

However, the determination of where the Issuer or a Luxembourg Guarantor has its center of main interests
is a question of fact, which may change from time to time.

Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of proceedings (the “Insolvency Proceedings”)
may be opened against the Issuer or a Guarantor incorporated in Luxembourg:

   - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which is initiated by the Issuer, the relevant
Luxembourg Guarantor or by any of their creditors or by Luxembourg courts ex officio. The directors
or managers of a Luxembourg company have the obligation to file for bankruptcy within one month in
case it is in a state of cessation of payment (cessation de paiements). If the managers or directors fail to
comply with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the
basis of principles of managers’/directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for
simple bankruptcy (banquerote simple) in accordance with article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial
code. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy
proceedings, if the Issuer or a Luxembourg Guarantor (i) is in default of payment (cessation de
_paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a Luxembourg_
court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open ex officio bankruptcy proceedings,
absent a request made by the Luxembourg company. The main effects of such proceedings are (i) the
suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain limited
exceptions, for secured creditors and (ii) the payment of the company’s creditors in accordance with
their ranking upon the realization of the company’s assets;

   - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested
by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may order provisional
suspension of payment including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured creditors; and

301


-----

   - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the obtaining of which is requested by the
company only after having received a prior consent from a majority of its creditors holding 75% at
least of the claims against the company. The obtaining of such composition proceedings will trigger a
provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors.

In addition to these insolvency proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the relevant Notes or the
Notes Guarantees may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis
_de paiement) or to put the company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation_
proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity that
violates criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce or of the
Luxembourg Companies Law.

The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow rules similar to those applicable to
insolvency proceedings. Liability of the company in respect of the relevant Notes or Notes Guarantees will, in the
event of a liquidation of the relevant company following insolvency or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank
after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of
the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law.

Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others:

   - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

   - value-added taxes and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Administration;

   - social security contributions; and

   - remuneration owed to employees.

For the avoidance of doubt, the list above is not exhaustive.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted and perfected will in principle not be available for
distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is foreclosed upon), and
subject to application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law.

During insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended.

In the event of controlled management proceedings, the ability of secured creditors to enforce their security
interest may also be limited, automatically causing the rights of secured creditors to be frozen until a final
decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter
by a reorganization order given by the relevant Luxembourg court subject to the exceptions under the
Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005 on financial collateral arrangements (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”). A
reorganization order requires the prior approval of more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of
the relevant company’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent
acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during
controlled management proceedings.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer or a
Luxembourg Guarantor during the period before insolvency, the so-called “suspect period” (période suspecte),
which is a maximum of six months from the date on which the Luxembourg Commercial Court formally
adjudicates a person insolvent and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten
days before the commencement of such period preceding the judgment declaring insolvency, except that in
certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date, if the insolvency
judgment was preceded by another insolvency proceeding (e.g., a suspension of payments or controlled
management proceedings) under Luxembourg law.

In particular:

   - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce), specified
transactions (such as the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts that
have not fallen due; whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any
other means; the payment of debts that have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by a bill of
exchange; or the sale of assets or entering into transactions generally without consideration or with
substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days
preceding it) will be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver;

302


-----

   - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as
well as other transactions concluded during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court
upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of
the insolvent party’s cessation of payments; and

   - regardless of the suspect period, Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and Article 1167
of the Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne) give any creditor the right to challenge any
fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the insolvency.

In principle, an insolvency order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination
of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its
solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the insolvency order. However, the insolvency
receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the
company. As of the date of adjudication of insolvency, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis
the insolvency estate. Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg
company’s business and assets and the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Luxembourg Guarantors
under the Notes Guarantees.

The insolvency receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e.,
contracts existing before the insolvency order). The insolvency receiver may elect to continue the business of the
debtor, provided the insolvency receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not
cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

   - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of an insolvency constitutes an
early termination or acceleration event; and

   - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts where the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the insolvency judgment
since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to
continue to perform under such contracts.

The insolvency receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the insolvent party that are still to be
performed after the insolvency under any agreement validly entered into by the insolvent party prior to the
insolvency. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the insolvency and such claim
will rank equal with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract
dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.

International aspects of Luxembourg insolvency, controlled management or voluntary arrangement with
creditors’ proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

**_Security interests considerations_**

The Notes are secured by several security interests governed by Luxembourg law. According to
Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex situs (the
law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation to the
creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law
will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or
deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held
with a Luxembourg bank, or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg,
securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in
Luxembourg, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets
will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with
Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of
pledges over shares, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. A judgment
of the European Court of Justice dated 10 November 2016 in Case C 156/15 relating to a pledge over monies
deposited to a current account, has held that Directive 2002/47/EC of 6 June 2002 on financial collateral
arrangements, confers to the pledgee the right to enforce the collateral, notwithstanding the commencement of
insolvency proceedings in respect of the pledgor, only if, (i) the monies covered by the collateral were deposited
in the account in question before the commencement of those proceedings or those monies were deposited in the
account in question on the day of commencement, the pledgor having proved that it was not aware, nor should

303


-----

have been aware, that those proceedings had commended and (ii) the account holder was prevented from
disposing of those monies after they had been deposited in that account.

Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration,
notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge over registered shares in a Luxembourg company must
be (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the pledge) and
(ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such
pledge will require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge under a
receivables pledge agreement will be validly created and perfected provided that the pledge under such
receivables pledge agreement is executed by the parties thereto. However, if the debtor has not been notified of
such receivables pledge or if it did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, it will be validly discharged of
its obligations if it pays the pledgor. A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the
account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights
in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to,
acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required.

Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence
of an enforcement event, including, without limitation:

   - the direct appropriation, or appropriation by third parties, of the pledged assets at a value determined in
accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties;

   - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms (conditions
_commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by way of a public auction;_

   - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following
a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

   - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the
method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv) the possible need to
involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security
interests might be substantially delayed.

According to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, with the exception of the provisions of the law of January 8,
2013 on the over-extension of debt, the provisions of Book III, Title XVII of the Luxembourg Civil Code, of
Book I, Title VIII and of Book III of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and national or foreign provisions
governing reorganization measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings and attachments are not
applicable to financial collateral arrangements and netting agreements and shall not constitute an obstacle to the
enforcement and to the performance by the parties of their obligations. Pursuant to Article 21(2) of the
Luxembourg Collateral Law, a financial collateral arrangement entered into after the opening of liquidation
proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid
and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators notwithstanding the suspect
period referred to in Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the secured party proves
that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or
that it could not reasonably be aware of it.

According to article 24 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the above protection applies not only to
Luxembourg security interests governed by the Luxembourg Collateral Law (such as Luxembourg pledges over
or collateral assignments of claims and financial instruments), but extends to foreign law financial collateral
arrangements, which are similar to the financial collateral arrangements subject to the Luxembourg Collateral
Law, where the collateral giver is located in Luxembourg.

Foreign law-governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be
enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or
arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers or
administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg
security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts
otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main
insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such
security interests or arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the
EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

304


-----

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any thirdparty creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests
created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the
forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in
principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law).

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by
operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or
unsecured creditors. This includes, in particular, the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as
well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the tax authorities
and certain assimilated parties (such as social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the
assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege may take precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in
respect of pledged assets.

**_Financial assistance_**

Any security interests granted by Luxembourg entities, which constitute breach of the provisions on
financial assistance as defined by article 430-19 of the Luxembourg Companies Law or any other similar
provisions might not be enforceable.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the Notes, the security interests agreements, the Indenture and the Transactions
documents (and any document in connection therewith) with the Administration de l’Enregistrement, des
Domaines et de la TVA in Luxembourg may be required in the case that the Notes, the security interest
agreements, the Indenture, and the Transactions documents (and any document in connection therewith) are
either (i) attached as an annex to an act (annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or
(ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (deposes au rang des minutes d’un notaire) or (iii) registered on a
voluntary basis. In such case, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of
the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be payable depending on the
nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of security interest agreements,
which are subject to the Luxembourg Collateral Law.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require (when these are presented before
them) that the Notes, the security interests agreements, the Indenture and the Transactions documents (and any
document in connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French,
German or Luxembourgish.

**_Luxembourg guarantee limitation_**

The granting of cross or upstream guarantees by a Luxembourg company in order to secure the obligations
of other entities may raise some corporate benefit issues, in particular in relation to the corporate interest of the
Luxembourg company having to provide such guarantees.

When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees, applicable corporate procedures normally entail that the
decision be approved by a board resolution or by the decision of delegates that have been appointed by the board
of managers or directors of the Luxembourg company for such purpose. In addition, the granting of the envisaged
guarantees must comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object.

The proposed action by the company must be “in the corporate interest of the company,” which is a
translation of the French “intérêt social,” an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit.
The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and interpreted by
court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior.” Whereas the
discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the
articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit requires a subjective judgment. In a group context, the
interest of the companies of the group taken individually is not entirely eliminated.

With respect to Guarantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the Luxembourg Companies Law does not
provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity
of the same group, it is generally held that within a group of companies, in the context of a group of related
companies, the existence of a group interest in granting upstream or cross stream assistance under any form
(including under the form of guarantee or security) to other group companies could constitute sufficient corporate

305


-----

benefit to enable a Luxembourg company to grant such guarantee, provided that the following conditions are met
(and subject in any event to all the factual circumstances of the matter): (i) such guarantee must be given for the
purpose of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies
applicable to the entire group, (ii) the commitment to grant such guarantee must not be without consideration and
such commitment must not be manifestly disproportionate in view of the obligations entered into by other group
companies, and (iii) such guarantee granted or any other financial commitments must not exceed the financial
capabilities of the committing company.

Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee on a group level is certainly
important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate for a lack of corporate interest for one
or more of the companies of the group taken individually. The concept of corporate interest is of particular
importance in the context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg
Companies Law.

The failure to comply with the corporate interest requirement will typically result in personal liability (civil
and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the Guarantor concerned. The guarantees granted by a
Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to
Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses
addressed by the Luxembourg Companies Law, a director or a manager of a company will in general be
prosecuted for misuse of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor.
This person may be an interested third party, e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency
receiver. In addition, it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the
existence of such a misuse of corporate assets became known to him. If there is a misuse of corporate assets
criminally sanctioned by court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts
concluded in breach of Article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Companies Law will be held null and void. The
criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case by case basis, and a subjective, fact based judgment is
required to be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company.

As a result of the above developments, the guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company (in the context of
upstream and/or cross stream guarantee(s)) will be subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of
general limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain
percentage of, inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres)) increased by its subordinated debts (dettes
_subordonnées), which is inserted in the relevant finance document(s), indentures or guarantee agreements and_
which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under the guarantee.

**Germany**

Certain of the Guarantors are or will be organized under the laws of Germany and have their registered
offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of a
Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its “center of main interests” in Germany at the
time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, any main
insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by
German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings over certain assets of a Guarantor may be
opened in other jurisdictions, in particular if such assets are located in another Member State of the European
Union. With respect to cross-border group insolvencies, Art 56 et seq. EU Insolvency Regulation introduced
requirements facilitating communication and cooperation between the administrators and courts involved. In
addition, a coordination procedure may be initiated, which involves the appointment of a coordinator and the
adoption of a cross-border coordination plan. See “—European Union.”

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) or the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG), may not be as favorable to
your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you
may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as
well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency
proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the
limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

**_Insolvency_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over indebtedness
(Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that the debtor is
unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According
to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its
liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s
business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a 12 months’
forecast horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter
_Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in_
Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company such as, e.g., a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft)
not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a situation of illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or over indebtedness (Überschuldung), each managing director of such company and,
in certain circumstances, its shareholders or members of the supervisory board, are obligated to file for
insolvency without undue delay but not later than three weeks after such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or
six weeks after such over indebtedness (Überschuldung) occurred or (as the case may be) was established.
Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claims as well as sanctions
under criminal law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or for restructuring proceedings (see “—Preventive Restructuring Framework”) in the event of
imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the company being unable
to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in time within a prognosis period of usually 24 months,
whereas imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) does not give rise to an obligation for the
management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in
the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (as amended
from time to time, the “COVInsAG”), provides, inter alia, for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency
until, currently, April 30, 2021. The suspension—as in force from January 1, 2021—applies to debtors who, in
the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021, have applied for financial assistance under state
assistance programs to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or have been prevented, as eligible
debtors, from filing such application for legal or factual reasons, unless the insolvency is not caused by
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and there is obviously no prospect of obtaining the state financial
assistance or the assistance that can be obtained is insufficient to eliminate the over-indebtedness or illiquidity.

A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung),
if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turn-around plan to be implemented
by way of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is not aware of any circumstances that
indicate that key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on incorrect assumptions. If a company faces
imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over-indebted (überschuldet), but not illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig), it may also file for preliminary “debtor in possession” protective shield proceedings
(Schutzschirmverfahren), unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful
restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger
_Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets). It may also_
implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three
months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan, which ideally shall be implemented in
formal “debtor-in- possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been
opened. During the period of either the preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings (vorläufige
_Eigenverwaltung) or the protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor shall prepare an_
insolvency plan, which ideally shall be implemented in formal “debtor-in-possession” proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). In particular, the insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken
to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings (other than with

307


-----

respect to immoveable assets) or, to the extent required to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business,
prohibit the enforcement of any collateral granted over claims, rights or other movable assets of debtor. If the
enforcement of collateral is prohibited by the insolvency court, secured creditors have to be adequately
compensated by the insolvency estate.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the
court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the
management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary trustee or
preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary
administrator or the preliminary trustee depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary
administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s
net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision
of the court, even the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the
preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger _Insolvenzverwalter),_ whilst in debtor-in-possession
proceedings, the debtor’s management retains the right to manage business. However, the court may also order
that certain disposals of the debtor may require the preliminary trustee’s (vorläufiger Sachwalter) consent also in
debtor-in-possession proceedings. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by
unsecured creditors against the debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’
committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three
requirements:

   - a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over
indebted);

   - revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year
preceding the filing; and/or

   - fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis (including, inter alios, part time employees).

The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of
other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important
decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the
following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) / preliminary
trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) / trustee (Sachwalter); and
court orders for “debtor in possession” proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung).

The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal
requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been
filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebtedness and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the
cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such
costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance
the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has granted “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court
will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon
opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter)
who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer
entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the
individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount_
of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and
(ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and
impartial. Individual creditors, or the debtor, can request the insolvency court to remove the insolvency
administrator only on the grounds of a lack of impartiality and only within six months from the appointment. The
insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor in possession proceedings, the debtor) may raise new financial
indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as
preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any unsecured insolvency liabilities
created by the debtor including, e.g., the Note Guarantees. Residual claims of a secured insolvency creditors
remaining after realization of the respective collateral (if any) also qualify as unsecured insolvency claim in this

308


-----

regard. However, in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings, the debtor shall only incur estate liabilities in the
ordinary course of business without the trustee’s (Sachwalter) consent.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time
unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

The insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (or trustee (Sachwalter) in case of debtor-in-possession
proceedings) may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were
effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent
_Transfer”)._

For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings over the
assets of any Guarantor would include, among possible voidance actions and other things, the following:

(a) unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer
and dispose of the Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

(b) unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by
the Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null and void by
operation of law;

(c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a
creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest
in part of the relevant insolvency debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency
estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency
proceedings;

(d) claims against the relevant debtor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth
in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

(e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute a part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim
for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter).

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the
insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency and restructuring law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape
clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or
restructuring proceedings or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency or restructuring
proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid in case of insolvency
proceedings if such clause would frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to
perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless such clause only reflects termination rights
applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to a preferential
right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency
proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor
with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement
action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency
proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition
is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective
proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings
separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, all unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and
will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured
creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after insolvency proceedings have been
commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency

309


-----

administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte)
in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus
costs and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured
creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security:
The insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets
within its possession that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable
assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii) to collect
any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some
voices in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement
process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any
insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) has standing to realize the pledges
on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this
question. That having been said, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) views the insolvency
administrator competent to realize pledged shares in a corporation that have been certificated (verbrieft) and are
hold in a custodian account (Depot) in Germany in case the shares represent more than 20% in the issued share
capital of the pledged company. It therefore appears likely that in this particular case, secured creditors would not
be held competent to realize the respective share pledges.

Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator,
the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds
(Ersatzabsonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of 9%
(or as agreed upon individually, but in any case at least 4%) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and
(ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to
an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the
insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) (being the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor) and would, after
deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary insolvency
administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) and the
insolvency court as well as the members of the (preliminary) creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of
certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders
of the Notes (to the extent not satisfied after enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes). If a Guarantor or
a subsidiary thereof subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other
than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such
security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of
the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the
obligations under the respective Note Guarantee by the respective Guarantor after such secured creditors have
been satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with
specific rules.

In addition, it may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any,
are distributed to unsecured creditors.

A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that
can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator or, in debtor-in-possession proceedings, by the
trustee (upon instruction of the preliminary creditors’ committee or the creditors’ meeting) and which requires, in
principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific
majority rules. The insolvency court may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups
under certain conditions (cram down). The insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) may derogate from the provisions of
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In particular, it may contain provisions regarding the discharge
of secured and unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create,
modify, transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is a corporate
entity, the shares or, as the case may be, the partnership interests in the debtor can also be included in the
insolvency plan, including an issuance of shares or partnership interests to third parties or to creditors based on a
debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain circumstances provide for provisions, inter
_alia, regarding the Notes or the Note Guarantees or the Collateral which are less favorable to the holders of the_
Notes than the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such as the release of the
Collateral or the release of obligations under the Notes or the Note Guarantees. Under certain conditions, such

310


-----

provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected holders of the Notes. However, it will not be
possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-for-equity swap
under the proposed insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan).

An insolvency plan can further provide for the release or other impairment of guarantees or other security
interests provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten), without such debtor affiliates being
required to become subject of the debtor’s or separate insolvency proceedings, provided that the relevant debtor
affiliate consents to the impairment. Creditors affected by such impairment are entitled to receive adequate
compensation. This means that the claims under the Note Guarantees can get impaired if the Issuer or a
Guarantor would enter into German insolvency proceedings, regardless of whether or not the relevant Guarantor
is itself subject of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies
in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of
view, has to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the
respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately.
However, the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) has provisions to facilitate the coordination of and
cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. Whereas these provisions do not provide for a
consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets
and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, they
stipulate four key measures in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single
court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppengerichtsstand); (ii) a
single person may be appointed as insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) for all relevant group
companies; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and
creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordinator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to
propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court
(Koordinationsgericht).

As a general principle, the claims arising from the Note Guarantees may be enforced against a Guarantor
outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the relevant Guarantor. Any insolvency proceedings over
the assets of a Guarantor would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the
entire group of affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may cause other Guarantors or other
affiliated companies to subsequently file for insolvency.

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including,
but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of
repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions, but except for government developments banks and its
affiliates). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the Indenture may result in the holders of
the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a “shareholder like” position (gesellschafterähnliche
_Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of a Guarantor, the claims arising from a_
Note Guarantee could be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen).
Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a
Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these
subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed
by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of
insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to claims of regular, unsecured creditors.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time
unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

**_Hardening Periods and fraudulent transfer_**

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or, in the event that
“debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) have been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also
challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency
creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable voidance
periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances,
extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of
insolvency proceedings.

311


-----

In the event of insolvency proceedings based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the
payment of any amounts to the holders of Notes as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit
support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) or, as the case may be, a trustee (Sachwalter) under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If the validity or enforceability of the respective Note Guarantees
or any Collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the Notes may not be able to
recover any amounts under the respective Note Guarantees or the relevant Collateral. If payments have already
been made under the respective Note Guarantees or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had
been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Notes would only
have a general unsecured claim under the relevant Note Guarantee without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the
provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases:

   - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (a) during the
last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if
the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such
illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig))
at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the
creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or the filing of such petition (or of
circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in
each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have
been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

   - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not
entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not
entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (a) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing
of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (b) such act was
taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at such time or (c) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such
act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of
circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an “affiliated
party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the
detrimental nature of such transaction for other creditors;

   - any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (a) during the three months prior to the
filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at such time or (b) after the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the
debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or such filing at the time of the transaction (or of
circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in
each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have
been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or of the filing to open insolvency
proceedings;

   - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security
(including a guarantee) for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings;

   - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the
insolvency creditors if the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act with such
knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was at least imminent

312


-----

(drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. For granting
an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which
such creditor was entitled, such knowledge is (solely) presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor
was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) (as opposed to the knowledge of imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in regular cases) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. Apart_
from that, such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain
security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form
or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), may only
be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing. There is a rebuttable
presumption that, if the debtor reached a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the creditor
or the creditor granted any other form of deferred payment (Zahlungserleichterungen) to the debtor, he
had no knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at the time of the transaction;

   - any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an “affiliated
party” (nahestehende Person), as described below, which directly operates to the detriment of the
creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing
of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the
debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded;

   - any act that grants security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a
claim under a shareholder loan granted to the debtor or an equivalent claim if (a) in the case of the
granting of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (b) in the case of
satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. This does not apply (a) to shareholders that
own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (b) until the
sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time
acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity with the intension to
restructure the debtor; and

   - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction to a third party for a loan claim or an equivalent claim if
(a) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of
insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (b) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security for such
loan or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder Bürge) for such loan (in which case
the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which
the conclusion must be drawn that, e.g., the respective debtor (e.g., a Guarantor) was unable to pay its debts
generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act
was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. Knowledge of pending
restructuring proceedings (see—“Preventive Restructuring Framework”) per se does not suffice for a creditor to
be deemed to have such “knowledge.” A person is further deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction
prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency
creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which
and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung),
the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced
by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). With respect to an “affiliated party” (nahestehende
_Person) as described below there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge” as indicated_
above.

In relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) includes, subject to
certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning
more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them
access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or
members of the household of any of the foregoing persons.

The provision of a security concurrently with the incurrence of debt funded as new money may be qualified
as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged. Meaning, under certain circumstances it may not be
subject to avoidance rights under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg). According to recent case

313


-----

law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), however, this privilege does not apply to claims
under a shareholder loan agreement or economically equivalent transactions as described above.

Any kind of newly granted third-party financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial
credits and other forms of financing) and respective collateral as well as shareholder loans under German
insolvency law avoidance provisions, which have been granted from March 1, 2020 until September 30, 2020 are
privileged under German insolvency law due to the CovInsAG. Thus, the repayment (including reasonable
interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered
disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020
(in certain cases, if the debtor fulfilled the respective requirements for a further suspension of the filing duties at
the time, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021). Loans granted, and security taken, by certain public
institutions as part of COVID-19 subsidies remain privileged even if granted or taken after that period. The
general privilege also includes the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not
apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically
similar acts.

Furthermore, any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan (see—“Preventive Restructuring
_Framework”) are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the_
debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or incomplete information presented by
the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof. This privilege does not apply to
shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral provided therefor.

Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the
insolvency estate.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor
or obtained security from a debtor may be liable towards another creditor if (i) such creditor was aware of the
debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency (for which
knowledge of pendent restructuring proceedings (see —“Preventive Restructuring Framework”) per se does not
suffice) at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted and (ii) the other creditor
suffered losses caused by a delayed filing for insolvency based on the additional or extended existing funding.
The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, e.g., the creditor was
to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation
of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the
transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security
was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. If, however, such
was additional funding has been provided or existing funding has been extended or respective collateral has been
granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in certain cases, until December 31, 2020 or April 30,
2021), any such transaction is statutorily exempted from the lender liability concept as laid out above.

**_Satisfaction of subordinated claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the
debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking
below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their
amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency
creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency
creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and
administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding
the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for
restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions
corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. However, the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and
receivables from economically similar acts is suspended in insolvency proceedings applied for up until
September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30,
2020 (in certain cases, if the debtor fulfilled the respective requirements for a further suspension of the filing
duties at the time, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021).

**_Preventive restructuring framework_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization
and Restructuring Act (StaRUG).

Based on the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on
preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive
(EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “Restructuring Directive”) the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has come into force on January 1, 2021. The Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a new pre-insolvency procedure to restructure the liabilities of
debtors, whose “centre of main interest” is located in Germany. This may apply as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum to certain of the Guarantors

As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1,
2021, no corresponding (court) practice exists as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and consequently any
proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) come with uncertainty.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of an initiation of restructuring proceedings
by a Guarantor having its “centre of main interest” in Germany would be in particular the following:

   - potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of the restructuring proceedings;

   - any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the restructuring
plan may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the Notes) with a majority of 75%
of the claims or by way of a so-called cross-class cram down by other classes under certain
presumptions;

   - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to restructuring
proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

   - restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors regarding their claims, or, if
applicable, their respective collateral over moveable assets of up to eight months due to a moratorium.

**_Restructuring proceedings_**

Restructuring proceedings may only be initiated by the relevant debtor with a notification of the competent
restructuring court of the commencement of restructuring proceedings. A debtor is eligible to file for
restructuring proceedings if it has become imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig). Such imminent
illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will be unable to
pay its debts as and when they fall due within a two years’ look-forward period.

During the restructuring proceedings, the debtor has to observe the duty of a prudent business manager,
which includes safeguarding the best interest of all of the debtor’s creditors. In particular, the debtor has to
refrain from any actions, which cannot be reconciled with or potentially frustrate the restructuring goal
(Restrukturierungsziel). This means that, generally, any claims, which shall be subject to the envisaged
restructuring plan, must not be settled or collateralized during the restructuring proceedings.

During the restructuring proceedings, the duty to file for insolvency without undue delay if the debtor
becomes illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) is generally suspended. However, if such an
insolvency event occurs, the debtor is obliged to notify the restructuring court accordingly without undue delay.
The restructuring court then abrogates the restructuring proceedings unless, in the restructuring courts discretion,
(i) the abrogation of the restructuring proceedings is, against the backdrop of the advanced status of restructuring
proceedings, evidently not in the interest of all creditors or (ii) the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or overindebtedness (Überschuldung) is caused by the enforcement of any such claim that is envisaged to be subject to
the restructuring plan provided the achievement of the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) remains
predominantly likely. Once restructuring proceedings have been abrogated by the restructuring court, the debtor
is again obliged to file for insolvency under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If (i) the
envisaged restructuring also comprises of consumer claims or claims of small or medium enterprises or
respective collateral granted for the benefit of such claims, (ii) the debtor has filed for a moratorium against all or
essentially all creditors or (iii) the envisaged restructuring plan provides for specific supervision of the settlement
of claims subject to the plan, the restructuring court has to appoint a mandatory restructuring officer
(Restrukturierungsbeauftragter). A mandatory restructuring officer is also to be appointed by the restructuring

-----

court if the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) can predictably only be achieved by a cram-down of
dissenting classes (unless only claims originated by financial institutions and/or shareholders are to be
compromised).

The restructuring court may appoint as mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) any
person with experience in restructurings and insolvencies who is suitable for the respective individual case and
who is qualified as a tax advisor, accountant, lawyer or has comparable qualifications (an “Eligible Restructuring
Officer”); the court may take suggestions by the debtor, creditors or shareholders into account. If (i) the debtor is,
based on expert opinion provided by an Eligible Restructuring Officer, eligible for a moratorium (see —
“Moratorium”), or (ii) creditors of one class with at least 25% of the corresponding votes in such class propose a
mandatory restructuring officer, the court may only appoint a mandatory restructuring officer different from the
proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer if the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer is evidently inadequate. If
a mandatory restructuring officer is appointed based on the proposal of the debtor or a group of creditors, the
restructuring court may appoint an additional mandatory restructuring officer in its own discretion.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) is entitled to decide on the procedure
to be elected for the voting on the restructuring plan and can be empowered by the restructuring court to
(i) supervise the debtor’s board and business situation and (ii) receive payments to and approve payments made
by the debtor. If a moratorium is granted, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to monitor that the
respective prerequisites of such moratorium persist and, in case such prerequisites do not persist, entitled to file
for a lifting of such moratorium. Additionally, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to comment on the
proposed plan’s prospects to remove the debtor’s imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and
restore the debtor’s viability.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has to perform its duties independently
and the debtor is obliged to share all relevant information with the mandatory restructuring officer.

The restructuring court can remove the mandatory restructuring officer from office for good cause ex officio
or, if the mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has not acted independently, on the
debtor’s or a creditor’s petition.

Furthermore, the debtor or at least 25% of creditors in a voting class, can request the appointment of an
optional restructuring officer to facilitate the development and negotiation of a restructuring plan. Creditors may
only request such appointment if they agree to be jointly and severally liable for the costs of the optional
restructuring officer. The optional restructuring officer is only obliged to support the stakeholders involved in the
negotiations of the restructuring plan, but has no further powers. An optional restructuring officer can also be
removed from office by the restructuring court ex officio for good cause or, if the optional restructuring officer
has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition.

Prior to a confirmation and implementation of a restructuring plan, the restructuring court may terminate the
restructuring proceedings for certain reasons, e.g. if the debtor notifies the restructuring court of the occurrence
of an insolvency event unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion (taking into account the actual status of the
relevant restructuring proceedings), the opening of formal insolvency proceedings is obviously not in the interest
of the entirety of the creditors or if the debtor files for insolvency or insolvency proceedings are opened over the
assets of the debtor based on a creditor’s filing.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Key element of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan, which can comprise certain selected
or all (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed
acts of tort) of the debtor’s liabilities, or amend the terms of financial and other agreements to which more than
the debtor and one other party are parties, including the terms and liabilities relating to the relevant debtor under
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Any form of financial or operational debt may be compromised, including contingent claims and undue
claims, and relating contractual arrangements including syndicated credit facilities and intercreditor agreements
can be amended by virtue of the plan. Corresponding collateral provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne
_Drittsicherheiten) may also be released and/or granted under a restructuring plan, provided that affected creditors_
are adequately compensated. Consequently, the Notes or the Note Guarantees could also be subject to a
restructuring plan provided the respective debtor has its “centre of main interest” in Germany.

316


-----

Further, a restructuring plan may provide for a (partial) debt-to-equity swap or other corporate law measures
like a share-capital increase. Debt-to-equity swaps can be implemented without the shareholders’ consent but
require the willingness of at least certain creditors to equitize their debt claims as no creditor can be forced to
take equity as a consideration under a restructuring plan. Hence, if, the Notes or the Note Guarantees were
subject to a restructuring plan providing for debt-to-equity swap, single holders of the Notes could not be forced
under the restructuring plan to take equity in the Issuer or a Guarantor without their respective consent.

The restructuring plan will be voted on by creditors of the debtor and must subsequently be confirmed by
the restructuring court. The vote may take place by way of consent solicitation process or in a (virtual) creditors’
meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes determined on the basis of the respective creditors’ economic
interests in the debtor. As a minimum distinction, secured creditors, unsecured creditors, creditors that benefit
from intra-group credit support and subordinated creditors (e.g. shareholders) will form separate classes.
However, also other factors like, e.g., cross-holdings, could be taken into account for class composition. 75% by
value of all claims of one class will be required to approve the plan for such class. There is no numerosity
requirement. Dissenting classes can be crammed down (or up), if

   - the class members can be expected to be no worse off under the plan than absent the plan (whereby the
alternative scenario must not necessarily be an in-court insolvent liquidation, but can also be an
alternative out-of-court restructuring on a going concern basis);

   - the crammed down (or up) class members receive an adequate share in the economic value created by
the plan; and

   - a majority of classes has accepted the plan.

A crammed down (or up) class receives an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan if (i) no
other creditor receives more than its claim’s par value, (ii) no creditors that would rank junior in insolvency
proceedings, the debtor or its shareholders receive any value through the plan which is not covered by a
respective stakeholder’s contribution to the plan and (iii) no creditor that would rank pari passu in insolvency
proceedings receives a preferential treatment compared to the dissenting class under the restructuring plan
(unless such preferential treatment is appropriate (sachgerecht) in light of the individual situation of distress to
overcome and the dissenting class accounts for no more than 50% of the rank’s total claims). However, despite
the prerequisite described under (ii) in the foregoing sentence, a creditor class can also be crammed down in case
a shareholder retains equity without any additional contribution if the shareholder itself is crucial for and
bindingly committed to the continuation of the debtor’s business and the realization of the restructuring plan or
the creditors’ rights are only compromised marginally (e.g. by a maturity extension of no more than 18 months).

Upon the debtor’s decision, either the debtor or the restructuring court can lead the voting on the plan. In
case the voting has been led by the debtor, the restructuring court has to hold a hearing of affected stakeholders
before the plan can be confirmed.

The restructuring court will confirm the plan unless (i) the debtor is not (longer) imminently illiquid
(drohend zahlungsunfähig), (ii) there is a material breach of statutory provisions regarding the procedure to adopt
the restructuring plan or its permitted content that cannot or has not been cured upon the restructuring court’s
notice, (iii) claims contemplated by or surviving the restructuring plan can obviously be not satisfied by the
debtor or (iv), if new money financing is contemplated under the restructuring plan, the underlying restructuring
concept is incoherent or appears to be based on incorrect facts or to have no reasonable prospect of success.
Additionally, dissenting creditors can request the restructuring court to reject the restructuring plan if the
applicant will be expectedly worse off under the restructuring plan than without the proposed restructuring plan
and the applicant has already raised such concern in the creditors’ meeting or creditors’ hearing, as applicable.
However, such application has no merits if the restructuring plan provides for funds to be distributed to creditors
that can prove to be worse-off, irrespective of whether any such applicant actually benefits from such funds.

Dissenting creditors can appeal against the restructuring court’s confirmation order of the plan if they are
able to produce prima facie evidence (glaubhaft machen) that they are worse-off under the restructuring plan and
funds provided thereunder to compensate worse-off creditors (if any) will not suffice for their individual
compensation. Such appeal will only have suspensive effect (aufschiebende Wirkung) against the effectiveness of
the restructuring plan if requested by the dissenting creditor and ordered by the court based on serious and
irreversible disadvantages for such dissenting creditor that are not in proportion to the benefits of an immediate
implementation of the restructuring plan.

Restructuring plans, which are negotiated and approved in public proceedings and confirmed by a German
restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings
Regulation upon the restructuring proceedings being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of the EU
Insolvency Proceedings Regulation. This is expected to occur in July 2022. In any other case, the recognition of
the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law. As the
Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, any such
recognition has not yet been tested as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

**_Moratorium_**

In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Corporate Stabilization
and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered by the competent court
upon application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors with regards
to their payment claims or the realization of respective collateral over moveable assets. The moratorium can
initially be ordered for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the
moratorium up to a maximum of eight months permissible under certain conditions. Such moratorium may also
be sanctioned with regards to collateral provided by the debtor’s affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten).

The moratorium does not suspend the relevant creditor’s interest claims. However, whereas creditors may
still file an insolvency petition against the debtor during a moratorium, correspondingly initiated insolvency
proceedings are suspended for the time of the moratorium. Under certain conditions, in particular if the
requirements to terminate restructuring proceedings are met or the debtor does not comply with certain statutory
duties under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) the competent court may lift the
moratorium, also on a creditor’s application.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

Some of the German Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—”GmbH”). Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and
security interests by these companies is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company
Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”) and other laws. These
provisions would also apply to any future German Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a
GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g., _Gesellschaft_ _mit_ _beschränkter_ _Haftung_ _&_ _Compagnie_
_Kommanditgesellschaft, “GmbH & Co. KG”)._

**_GmbH Limitation Language—general_**

As a general rule, Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets
(meaning, assets minus liabilities and liability reserves as determined under German Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital);
in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, such provisions apply to the general partner which is a GmbH. The granting or
enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH or by a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or
secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections
30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to
secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31,
it is standard market practice for indentures, certain credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to
contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Germany in the legal form
of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the
security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the security
interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s
(or, in case of a KG, its general partner that is a GmbH) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the
case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be
further reduced. Accordingly, the Notes Guarantee, the Indenture and the Security Documents provided by the
German Guarantors will contain such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees,
the Indenture and the Collateral is limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the
respective Notes Guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

319


-----

(ii) The restrictions in paragraph (i) shall not apply:

(A) if and to the extent the Limited Upstream Obligation of the GmbH Guarantor secures any
indebtedness under any Notes Document in respect of:

(1) amounts which are (directly or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant
GmbH Guarantor or its Subsidiaries; or

(2) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit of any of the creditors of the

avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph (ii) shall have the effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced
multiple times (no double dip);

(B) if, at the time of enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation, a DPLA (either directly or
indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer agreements) exists
between the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by the relevant
Limited Upstream Obligation as dominating company (herrschendes Unternehmen) and the
relevant GmbH Guarantor as a dominated company (beherrschtes Unternehmen), provided that:

(1) the GmbH Guarantor is a Subsidiary of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor whose
obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or

(2) the GmbH Guarantor and the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured
by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or
indirect) parent company with such parent company as dominating entity (beherrschendes

sentence 1 GmbHG;

(C) if and to the extent any payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation is covered (gedeckt) by a
fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder
_Rückgewähranspruch) of the GmbH Guarantor against the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor whose_
obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or

(D) if the relevant GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to paragraphs
(iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable) below; however, if and to the extent that the relevant Limited
Upstream Obligation has been enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in this
paragraph (b) because the Management Notification and/or the Auditor’s Determination has not
(or not in a timely manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable)
below, but the Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered within four months from its due
date in accordance with paragraphs (iv) below, the Trustee shall upon demand of the GmbH
Guarantor repay any amount received from the GmbH Guarantor which pursuant to the Auditor’s
Determination would not have been available for enforcement, if the Auditor’s Determination had
been delivered in a timely manner.

(iii) If the relevant GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee within fifteen (15) Business Days after the
making of a demand against that GmbH Guarantor under the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation:

(A) to what extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or
indemnity; and

(B) to what extent a GmbH Capital Impairment would occur as a result of an enforcement of the
Limited Upstream Obligation (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its GmbH Net Assets,
providing an up-to-date pro forma balance sheet),

then the restrictions set out in paragraph (i) above shall cease to apply until a Management Notification has
been provided.

(iv) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) Business Days of
its receipt, request the relevant GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within forty-five
(45) Business Days of receipt of such request a determination by the Auditors or any other auditors of

320


-----

international standard and reputation appointed by the GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense)
setting out in reasonable detail the amount in which the payment under the Limited Upstream
Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment subject to the terms set out under this paragraph
(b). Save for manifest errors, the Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on all parties.

(v) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from demanding any
or only partial payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation, the Trustee ascertains in good faith
that the financial conditions of the GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s Determination has
substantially improved, the Trustee (acting reasonably) may, at the GmbH Guarantor’s cost and
expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the GmbH Guarantor by applying
the same principles that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s Determination by the auditors
who prepared the Auditor’s Determination in order for such Auditors to determine whether (and, if so,
to what extent) the GmbH Capital Impairment has been cured as result of the improvement of the
financial condition of the GmbH Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an
Auditor’s Determination prior to the expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the
preceding Auditor’s Determination. The Trustee may only demand payment under the Limited
Upstream Obligation to the extent the Auditors determine that the GmbH Capital Impairment have
been cured.

(vi) The GmbH Net Assets shall be adjusted as follows:

(A) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant GmbH Guarantor which
was carried out after the relevant GmbH Guarantor became a party to this Indenture and made
from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted from the
amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant GmbH Guarantor if it is
expressly prohibited under the Notes Documents and has been carried out without the prior
written consent of the Trustee;

(B) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 253 (6) HGB shall not be included in the
calculation of GmbH Net Assets;

(C) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 268 (8) HGB shall not be included in the
calculation of GmbH Net Assets;

(D) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 272 (5) HGB shall not be included in the
calculation of GmbH Net Assets; and

(E) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly negligent
violation of the Notes Documents shall not be taken into account as liabilities.

(vii) Where a GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b) that the
Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall realize, to the extent lawful and within
reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance
sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets and
are not necessary for the relevant GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig).

(c) Liquidity Impairment Limitation Language
(i) Save as set out in this paragraph (c), the Trustee shall not enforce, and any German Guarantor
shall have a defence (Einrede) against, any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to the extent a
payment and/or enforcement in respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a Liquidity
Impairment for such German Guarantor.

(ii) Paragraphs (b)(iii), (b)(iv), (b)(v) and (b)(vii) above (including the repayment contemplated in
paragraph (b)(ii)(D) above) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the restriction in paragraph (i) above.

(d) Where the provisions of this Section [Š] apply to a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft), all
references to the assets of a German Guarantor shall mutatis mutandis include a reference to the assets
of the general partner (Komplementär) of such limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft).

(e) In addition to the restrictions set out in paragraphs (b) through (d) above, if a German Guarantor
demonstrates that, according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the payment under and/
or enforcement of any Limited Upstream Obligation against such German Guarantor would result in
personal liability of its managing director(s) (Geschäftsführer) or director(s) (Vorstände) for a

321


-----

reimbursement of payments made under any Limited Upstream Obligation (including, without
limitation, pursuant to §§ 30, 31, 43 GmbHG, § 15(b) InsO and/or § 826 BGB), the German Guarantor
shall have a defence (Einrede) against the Limited Upstream Obligation to the extent required in order
not to incur such liability.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Limited Upstream Obligation granted
by a German Guarantor or of any subsidiary of a German Guarantor in respect of any borrowing
liabilities which are owed by that German Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries shall not be limited
under Section [Š].

(g) Nothing in this Section [Š] shall prevent the Trustee or a German Guarantor from claiming in court that
payments under and/or an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligations do or do not fall within
the scope of §§ 30, 31, 43 GmbHG, § 15(b) InsO and/or § 826 BGB (as applicable).

(h) Nothing in this Section [Š] shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under this Indenture
or any other Notes Document to the Trustee or vice versa.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, this Section [Š] and any rights and/or
obligations arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law. Each
reference in this Section [Š] to a statutory provision shall be construed to be a reference to the relevant
equivalent statutory provision (if any) as amended, re-enacted or replaced from time to time.

**_General Comments regarding GmbH Limitation Language_**

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect to
Sections 30, 31 GmbHG and Section 15(b) InsO), are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that
future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the
form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantors to make payments on the
Notes or the Notes Guarantees or the enforceability of the Notes Guarantees, the Indenture and the Security
Documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (meaning, a situation in
which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may
be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a Guarantee or other collateral granted by the German
Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced,
even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a
security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the
stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by
disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply
this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantee or any Collateral by the German Guarantors.

The enforcement of security granted by a German Guarantor may also be excluded (entirely) in case the
granting or enforcement of such security and/or the filing for insolvency as a consequence of a claim by any so
secured finance party under such security resulted or would result in any personal liability of the relevant
German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to Section 15(b) InsO.

Furthermore, the beneficiary (for example, a holder of Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of
the stated share capital of the grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable, (for example, the provision
or the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable under
exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the
case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the
other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention
could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor
of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire
further with respect thereto.

**_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_**

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests
(akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured

claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated, and may not be
assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is
assigned. The holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security Documents. In order to
permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under
German law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a Parallel Debt (as defined therein).
Pursuant to the creation of the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal
to each amount payable by each obligor under, in particular, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. The pledges
governed by German law will directly and exclusively secure the Parallel Debt rather than the obligations under
the Notes or the Notes Guarantees or the holders of the Notes directly. The validity of the Parallel Debt concept
and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such Parallel Debt has not been tested before German
courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German
law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders
of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Escrow Charge will be granted to the Trustee and the security_
_interests in the remaining Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent, in each case, rather than directly to_
_the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral_
_may be restricted by local law.”_

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement
of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset
constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods
and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral
gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from
foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of
security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds
from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (meaning, the right to request
the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor
or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending)
insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was
provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally
influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores
(Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any
circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of_
_the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees (together, the “Securities”) have not been, and will not be, registered
under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the
Securities offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in
Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore
transactions to non-U.S. persons outside of the United States (in each case, as defined in Regulation S) in reliance
on Regulation S under the Securities Act.

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and the “United States” with the meanings given to
them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Securities (other than the Initial Purchasers), by its acceptance thereof, will be
deemed to have acknowledged, represented to, warranted to and agreed with the Issuer, each Guarantor and the
Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Securities have not been registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and that the Securities are
being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other
securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and, unless so
registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption
therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and, in each case, in compliance with the conditions
for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below;

(2) The purchaser is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Issuer or any
Guarantor, is not acting on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor and is either:

(a) a qualified institutional buyer, within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and
is aware that any sale of these Securities to them will be made in reliance on Rule 144A under
the Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for their own account or for the account of
another qualified institutional buyer; or

(b) a non-U.S. person (and is not purchasing the Securities for the account or benefit of a U.S.
person) and is purchasing the Securities outside the United States in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act and, if resident in a member state of the
EEA or the United Kingdom, not a retail investor;

(3) The purchaser acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, nor any
person representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or sale
of any of the Securities, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum, which
offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment
decision with respect to the Securities. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any
person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of this offering memorandum. It has had access to such financial and other information
concerning us and the Securities as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase
any of the Securities, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the
Issuer and the Initial Purchasers;

(4) The purchaser is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for
which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case, for investment, and not with a view to, or for
offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its
property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control
and subject to its or their ability to resell such Securities to a qualified institutional buyer pursuant to
Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S or any other
exemption from registration available under the Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the
Securities Act;

324


-----

(5) The purchaser understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for
which it is purchasing the Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities by its acceptance
thereof will be deemed to agree, that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer
any Securities or any beneficial interests in any Securities, it will do so prior to the date which is, in the
case of Securities offered to qualified institutional buyers, one year after the later of the original issue
date of such Securities, the original issue date of the issuance of any additional securities and the last
date on which the Issuer or any affiliate of the Issuer was the owner of such Security (or any
predecessor of such Security) and, in the case of Securities offered to non-U.S. persons in accordance
with Regulation S, 40 days after the later of the original issue date of such Security and the date on
which such Security (or any predecessor of such Security) was first offered to persons other than
distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S only (i) to the Issuer,
the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared
effective under the Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Securities are eligible for resale pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer
that purchases for its own account or for the account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is
given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to
offers and sales that occur in offshore transactions outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in
compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any
requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or
accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities
laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s
rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) to require the delivery of an
opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each
of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of
the Security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on
resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date;

(6) Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”) OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE

If the purchaser purchases Securities, it will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Securities as well as to holders of these Securities.

(7) The purchaser agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Securities notice of any
restrictions on the transfer of such Securities;

(8) The purchaser acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer
any Securities acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and the
Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with;

transfer of the Securities will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution”
and “Transfer Restrictions.”

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase
from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The sale of the Notes will be made pursuant to a
purchase agreement among the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final offering
memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”).

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial
Purchasers will purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the
cover of this offering memorandum. Depending on market conditions, certain of the Initial Purchasers may
decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own accounts. After the initial Offering, the
Initial Purchasers may change the price at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time
without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in
respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker
dealer intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S.
registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject
orders in whole or in part.

Persons who purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price
set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses.

The Sponsor or its affiliates may place a purchase order for and be allocated the Notes at a purchase price
per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum, subject to a pass
through of the Initial Purchasers’ discount (ignoring any credit) in respect of the Notes purchased by such
persons.

Investment funds advised by entities affiliated with the Sponsor may purchase Notes in the Offering at a
purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum, and in
the case of investment funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940
Act”), subject to the 1940 Act. The Purchase Agreement between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers will not
restrict the ability of the funds and the affiliates of the Sponsor to buy or sell the Notes in the future and, as a
result, these investment funds and affiliates of the Sponsor may buy or sell Notes in open market transactions at
any time following the consummation of the Offering.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The
Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the
non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will indemnify and hold
harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will
contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not
to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt
securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer and the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries that are substantially
similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date
falling 30 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs Bank Europe
SE.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and
may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule
144A and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of
(i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially
sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the
Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise

than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings
given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Certain
_Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions.”_

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

   - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and

   - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection
with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with
any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not
constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to
inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of
this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer has also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or
disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of
Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Issuer will apply, through their Listing Agent, for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on
the Official List of the Exchange; however, the Issuer cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if
obtained, maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market
making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In
addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). Accordingly, we cannot assure you
that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell
any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating the
_Notes—Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”_

In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining
the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short
position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In
addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective
market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not
required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be
given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—
_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be
higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after
the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if
commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are
commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days after the date of issuance of the Notes
and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over
the counter market or otherwise.

Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle
in two business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6 1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against
payment on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will
be business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as
“T+ ”). Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade such Notes on the date of this offering memorandum
or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle
at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades
should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are currently providing, or
may in the future provide, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking, various lending,
hedging, cash management, guarantee or other banking or budgeting services to us and our affiliates under
bilateral agreements or local facilities in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may
receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of
the Notes. In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates will act as mandated lead arrangers and
original lenders, as applicable, under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, which we will enter into as
borrowers and draw to provide financing for the Acquisition. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates
may also act as counterparties in hedging arrangements. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or certain of
their respective affiliates, including Goldman Sachs International, advised the Sponsor on the Acquisition. The
Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have provided a bridge facility that will be cancelled, including all
commitments thereunder, on the Issue Date. In addition, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, an affiliate of Goldman
Sachs Bank Europe SE, will act as administrative agent and co-collateral agent, and Citibank, N.A., London
Branch, an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Limited, will act as co-collateral agent under the ABL Facility
Agreement. Goldman Sachs Bank USA will also act as agent and security agent under the Senior Term Facilities
Agreement. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and/or its affiliates are lenders under the Existing Credit Facility
which will be repaid and terminated on or around the Acquisition Closing Date. Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft and/or its affiliates are also lenders under the Existing Real Estate Facilities which are
expected to remain in place following the Transactions. In connection with their services in such capacities, the
Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have received in the past, or will receive in the future, customary
fees and commissions.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold
a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default
swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any
such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent
research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that
they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Most of our managers
and executive officers live outside the United States. A substantial portion of our assets and the assets of our
directors, managers and executive officers are located outside the United States. As a result, although we have
appointed an agent for service of process under the Indenture governing the Notes, it may be difficult for you to
serve process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against
them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.

**Luxembourg**

As there is no treaty between Luxembourg and the United States regarding the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, courts in Luxembourg will not automatically
recognize and enforce a final judgement rendered by a U.S. court. A valid and conclusive judgment against the
Issuer or a Luxembourg Guarantor with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees obtained from a court of
competent jurisdiction in the United States, remains in full force and effect after all appeals as may be taken in
the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be recognized and enforced
through a court of competent jurisdiction of Luxembourg subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures
(exequatur) set out in the relevant provisions of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code
_de Procédure Civile) and Luxembourg case-law, being:_

   - the foreign court must properly have had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter, both according
to its own laws and to the Luxembourg international private law conflict of jurisdiction rules;

   - the foreign court must have applied the substantive law which is designated by the Luxembourg
conflict of laws rules or, at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules
(based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an
exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court);

   - the decision of the foreign court must be enforceable (exécutoire) in the jurisdiction in which it was
rendered;

   - the decision of the foreign court must not have been obtained by fraud, but in compliance with the
rights of the defendant to appear, and if the defendant appeared, to present its defense and in
compliance with its own procedural laws; and

   - the decisions and the considerations of the foreign court must not contravene Luxembourg international
public policy rules or have been given in proceedings of a tax, penal or criminal nature (which would
include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or
other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or
punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive damages)) or rendered subsequent to an evasion of
Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi). Ordinarily an award of monetary damages would not be considered
as a penalty, but if the monetary damages include punitive damages such punitive damages may be
considered as a penalty.

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, without prejudice to specific conflict of law rules,
Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law if the choice of the foreign law was not made bona
fide or if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or, if pleaded and proved, the foreign law was contrary to
Luxembourg mandatory provisions (lois impératives) or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules. In
an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may
not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought.

In practice, Luxembourg courts now tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is
no clear statutory prohibition of such review.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give
judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against
any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be
converted into euro.

**Germany**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil
liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action
to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of
Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments,
other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore
may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely
upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment
by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court
of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the
original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final
under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section
328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist:

   - if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did not
have jurisdiction;

   - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense,
provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly;

   - if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign court
which is to be recognized in Germany;

   - if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a
proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before the U.S.
federal or state court entered its judgment;

   - if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German
law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte)
guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

   - if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a
comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that
reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets
(vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that
attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities
laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as
incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of
damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate
actual losses or damages.

Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being
of a penal or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as
the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common
law provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the
production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this
matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under
German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under

331


-----

such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons
will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment
relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the
judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within Germany upon the German Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law
implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which
may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights
(Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German
Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the
action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**SUMMARY OF CERTAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GERMAN GAAP COMPARED TO IFRS**
**RELATED TO MANAGEMENT’S KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES**

The financial information of the BIRKENSTOCK Group included in this offering memorandum has been
prepared and presented in accordance with German GAAP. Such policies and standards are laid down in German
law and by German accounting standards. Significant differences exist between German GAAP and IFRS, which
might be material to the financial information herein. Such differences not only affect the measurement of net
income and shareholders’ equity, but the fundamental basis for preparing the Financial Statements. In making an
investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of our business and financial condition, the
terms of the notes and the financial information provided in this document. No attempt has been made to quantify
the impact of any differences to our financial information, nor has a reconciliation of German GAAP and IFRS
financial information been prepared. Potential investors should consult their own professional advisors for an
understanding of the differences between German GAAP and IFRS, and how those differences might affect the
Group’s financial information contained herein.

Had we undertaken any such quantification or the preparation of such reconciliation in respect of our
financial information, other potentially significant accounting and disclosure differences might have come to its
attention, which are not identified below. Accordingly, none of the Issuer or any other member of the Group can
provide no assurance that the differences described below represent all significant differences between German
GAAP and IFRS, as they would apply to the BIRKENSTOCK Group’s financial information presented.

Set forth is a summary of the significant differences between German GAAP and IFRS as they relate to the
BIRKENSTOCK Group for the periods presented herein. This summary details the significant differences
between German GAAP and IFRS on the basis of existing guidance. Regulatory bodies that promulgate German
GAAP and IFRS have significant ongoing projects that could affect future comparisons such as this one between
German GAAP and IFRS. Future developments or changes in either German GAAP or IFRS may give rise to
additional differences between German and IFRS, which could have a significant impact on us.

**_Financial Statement Presentation_**

Under IFRS, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on a current/non-current distinction of assets and
liabilities. IFRS requires the presentation of assets and liabilities in order of liquidity only when a liquidity
presentation provides information that is reliable and is more relevant than a current/non-current presentation.
Under German GAAP, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on liquidity of the assets and liabilities. In
addition, the regulations concerning the presentation of financial statements under IFRS could lead to different
disclosures in the balance sheet and the income statements compared to German GAAP. The disclosures required
in the explanatory notes to the financial statements are more extensive under IFRS than under German GAAP.
German GAAP does not require a cash flow statement or statement of changes in equity whereas IFRS has this
requirement.

**_Impairment of Assets_**

Under IFRS, an impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs of
disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does
not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. If this is the
case, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs, unless either
(i) the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal is higher than its carrying amount; or (ii) the asset’s value in use
can be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs of disposal and fair value less costs of disposal can be
measured.

Under German GAAP, an impairment loss for long-lived assets must only be recorded if a permanent
impairment in value is anticipated. An impairment loss is recognized under German GAAP if the fair value less
cost to sell is permanently expected to be lower than the carrying amount of an asset. The concept of cash
generating units is not applicable under German GAAP, and impairment loss is determined on an item-by-item
basis.

**_Amortization, depreciation and impairment on intangible and tangible assets_**

Under IFRS and German GAAP, amortization and depreciation are based on the useful life of the relevant
asset. However, under German GAAP, all intangible and tangible assets are subject to amortization and

338


-----

depreciation, whereas under IFRS intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, are not amortized but are only
subject to an impairment test which is performed on at least an annual basis. We amortize both goodwill and
brands in our German GAAP financial statements mainly over a period of five years and 35 years, respectively.
Under IFRS, both goodwill and brands would be identified as indefinite lived intangible assets, and therefore not
amortized but subject to annual impairment testing.

**_Leases_**

Under German GAAP, accounting for leases is primarily due to certain decrees of the Federal Ministry of
Finance, to determine whether capitalization at the lessee level is required. These rules differ from IFRS rules in
several respects. Some leases specified as operating lease under German GAAP may qualify as a finance lease
under IFRS.

Under IFRS 16 (Leases), all rent and leasing contracts are accounted on-balance as financial leases, i.e. the
rights of use (“RoU”) are capitalized as fixed assets with a corresponding liability and the rent and leasing
expenses in the Profit and Loss Statement are replaced by depreciation of the RoU-asset and interest from the
lease liability.

From a high-level perspective the impact on EBIT will largely depend on the volume and residual terms of
rent and leasing contracts, while EBITDA will increase from the add-back of rent and leasing expenses.
Correspondingly, net debt will increase by the RoU-liability.

**_Provision for Pensions_**

Under German GAAP and IFRS, post-employment benefits are classified either as defined contributions or
defined benefit plans. Under IFRS, it is required to use the projected unit credit method to determine the present
value of the entity’s defined benefit obligation, whereas under German GAAP, no actuarial valuation method is
specified. The use of actuarial techniques shall result in an economically reasonable amount. The use of the
projected unit credit method is only one of the permissible actuarial valuation methods.

A major difference between German GAAP and IFRS is the discount rate used to discount post-employment
benefit obligations. Under IFRS, the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields of high-quality
corporate bonds at the end of the reporting period. Under German GAAP, the determination of the discount is
determined on i.e., the average market yields for the past seven years.

Under German GAAP, all changes in the pension liability are recognized in the income statement, whereas
under IFRS, certain changes in the pension liability are recognized in the other comprehensive income. The
amount which has to be accounted for as a liability from a defined benefit plan equals of the cash value of the
defined benefit pension obligation, less the fair value of the plan assets which exist for the direct fulfillment of
the obligation.

**_Provisions and Contingencies_**

Under IFRS, provisions are recognized if an entity has a present obligation as a result of a past event and if
it is probable (meaning, more likely than not or probability greater than 50%) that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount
recognized as a provision shall be the best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the present obligation at
the end of the reporting period. The best estimate is the amount the entity would pay to settle the obligation or to
transfer it to a third party at that time.

Under German GAAP, the criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingencies are less detailed and
prescriptive than under IFRS. Provisions shall only be recognized in the amount that is necessary according to
prudent business judgement. The uncertain nature therefore requires estimates of the amount to be recognized.
Under German GAAP, the discount rate is determined on the average market yields for the past seven years,
whereas the discount rate according to IFRS reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the liability.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging_**

Under IFRS, derivative financial instruments (for example, interest rate swaps) are recorded in the
consolidated statements of financial position at fair value (mark-to-market) on the acquisition date. Changes in
the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or as separate component of equity, depending
on whether a derivative is designated as a part of a hedge transaction and the type of the hedge transaction.

Under German GAAP, there is no distinction in the accounting treatment between fair value hedges, cash
flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. If a derivative financial instrument and its

339


-----

related underlying instrument are designated as a hedge for a particular risk exposure (“Valuation Unit”), and the
hedge is considered to be effective, the changes of the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item
are netted in the income statement line of the hedged items. Therefore, the effective portion of the hedged item
and the hedging instrument remains unrecognized. However, under German GAAP, a provision for anticipated
contract losses is recognized for the portion of the negative market values of the interest rate swaps exceeding the
underlying transactions as well as for the ineffective portion of the Valuation Units. Unrealized gains are not
recognized under German GAAP. If the liabilities to banks relate to floating rate interest-bearing loans,
respective swaps are entered into to fix the interest rates. If the requirements are met, hedging instruments and
hedged items are combined to form a Valuation Unit and are accounted for using the net hedge presentation
method. In accordance with the net hedge presentation method, the effective portion of the hedged item and the
hedging instrument remains unrecognized as long as the hedge is effective. The hedge effectiveness is
determined by means of the dollar-offset-method. A provision for anticipated contract losses is recognized for the
portion of the negative market values of the interest rate swaps exceeding the hedged item as well as for the
ineffective portion of the Valuation Units. Unrealized gains for the hedging instruments and the hedged items are
not recognized.

**_Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings_**

Under IFRS, all interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of the
consideration received, less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans
and borrowings are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Under German GAAP,
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recorded at their repayment amounts. Transaction costs, except for
costs to be paid to the finance providers, are expensed as incurred. Only transaction costs paid to finance
providers are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis to interest and similar expense.

**_Prepaid Expenses for Bank Loans_**

Under German GAAP, prepaid expenses in connection with a bank loan are included in prepaid expenses on
the assets side of the balance sheet and amortized by systematic annual charges over the full time of the liability.
Under IFRS, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the originated bank loan are amortized through
profit or loss over the term of the loan using the effective interest method.

**Condensed Notes to the Consolidated Interim Financial Statements**
**for the financial quarter from 1[st]** **October 2020 to 31[st]** **December 2020 (“Q1 2021”)**
**of**
**Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG, Linz am Rhein**

**I.** **General information**

Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG, Linz am Rhein, (abbreviated below as “BS KG” or “company”) has been the
parent company of the Birkenstock Group since 1[st] October 2013. Birkenstock Group’s consolidated interim
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with German GAAP and the German Accounting
Standard 16 (DRS 16).

The BS KG is registered in the Commercial Register at the Montabaur District Court under the number
HRA 21317.

The income statement is prepared using the total cost method.

To the extent necessary the format of the group balance sheet is extended to include the special items for
limited partners.

In order to adjust the group’s retained earnings to the retained earnings reported in the quarterly financial
statements of BS KG, the equity was extended by the item “Adjustment item for lower consolidated net income
compared with the parent company”.

The quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with our annual financial statements 2020,
which contain a detailed description of our business operations as part of the group management report.

**II.** **Companies consolidated**

Changes in companies consolidated for the financial year 2020 are presented as part of the notes to the
financial statement for the financial year 2020. Since beginning of the financial year 2021 the following changes
occurred:

   - foundation of Birkenstock Norway AS, Oslo/ Norway; in November 2020

The comparability of the current year’s consolidated interim financial statements to that of the prior year
was not affected by changes in the companies consolidated.

**III. Consolidation methods**

There haven’t been any changes in consolidation methods since the consolidated financial statements 2020.
An explicit description of consolidation methods is part of the notes to the beforementioned report.

**IV. Accounting policies**

The accounting policies and measurement principles applied in these quarterly financial statements are
based on those used in the consolidated financial statements of the Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG for the
financial year 2020. An overview of accounting policies applied can be found as part of the notes to the annual
report 2020.

For the purpose of these consolidated interim financial statements, taxes on income are recognized based on
the best estimate of the weighted income tax rate expected for the full year. This tax rate is applied to the pre-tax
result.

**V.** **Explanations to selected items of the consolidated balance sheet**

**Inventories**

The strong increase in inventories by kEUR 42,255 in the reporting period compared with September 30,
2020 results mainly from an increase of finished goods. One reason for this is that higher net sales of direct to
consumer channels induce relatively higher stock levels compared to any wholesale and distribution business to
fulfill the demand of this particular market segment.

**Receivables and other assets**

Trade receivables amount to kEUR 35,873 (September 30, 2020: kEUR 55,419) depicting seasonality of the
first quarter as well as changes in underlying processes and revenue. To ensure liquidity measures like process
optimzations in accounts receivables and a higher share of prepayment terms were implemented. Further, the
increase of online sales has decreased days sales outstanding due to shorter payment terms granted compared to
business customers.

**Cash on hand and bank balances**

The decrease by kEUR 24,615 compared with September 30, 2020 is attributable to the seasonality of
business as well as dividends paid to shareholders. Further, improvements in days sales outstanding do not
require additional financing for the first quarter of the financial year.

**Other provisions**

Other provisions were formed mainly for personnel expenses (kEUR 13,346, September 30, 2020 kEUR
22,170). Further provisions include essentially expenses for pending invoices as well as the outstanding invoices
for temporary workers.

The decrease in liabilities by kEUR 17,086 is mainly attributable to the settlement of payables to
shareholders.

**Deferred taxes**

**III. Consolidation methods**

The capital consolidation is performed using the revaluation method. According to this the carrying value
of the shares of the equity of the subsidiary is to be measured at the amount representing the fair value of the
assets, liabilities, prepaid and accrued items and special items to be taken up in the consolidated financial
statements. The determination of the fair values is performed on the date of the initial consolidation of the
subsidiary or rather when the entity becomes a subsidiary.

A positive amount remaining after offsetting the carrying amounts of the shares with the revalued equity of
the subsidiary is capitalised as goodwill and amortised straight-line over the expected useful life.

Active differences totalling kEUR 24,080 (prior year kEUR 24,078) exist from capital consolidation.

The carrying amount of goodwill capitalised from the capital consolidation as at 30 September 2020
amounts to kEUR 11,558 (prior year kEUR 12,890). In the financial year 2019/2020 no unscheduled depreciation
on goodwill was accounted.

Minority interests in the equity of consolidated subsidiaries are disclosed within equity under the item
**“Non-controlling interests”. In the group income statement, the profit or loss attributable to minority**
shareholders within group results is shown separately below the net profit for the year.

F-18


-----

The consolidation of debts is performed by elimination of loans, receivables, provisions and liabilities
between the entities included in the consolidated financial statements. If there are liabilities and receivables
between the entities included in the consolidation, for which postponement of priority has been declared, these
are allocated to the consolidated equity or rather to the carrying amount of the shares and included in the firsttime capital consolidation.

Within the elimination of intercompany profits allowances were made to inventories disclosed at the
reporting date which derive from supplies from entities included in the group financial statements totalling kEUR
46,643 (prior year: kEUR 48,745).

The consolidation of income and expenses was performed by offsetting revenues and other operating
income between group companies against the corresponding expenses. Furthermore, interest income and income
from profit and loss transfer agreements are offset against corresponding counter items and intra-group profit
distributions were eliminated.

Where there are differences arising from the consolidation measures between the values of assets, liabilities
or deferred items under German commercial code and their tax values, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
calculated on these to the extent that these differences are expected to reverse in later financial years.

The changes in consolidation items not impacting income and the prior year results of the subsidiaries
generated after the time of initial consolidation are included in or offset against group equity.

The annual financial statements of subsidiaries in foreign currency included in the consolidation are
**translated in accordance with § 308a HGB. Under this rule the assets and liabilities of the balance sheet are**
translated into Euro at the mean spot exchange rate on the reporting date, except for shareholders’ equity which
is translated at the historic rate at the time of initial consolidation. Items in the income statement are translated at
the average exchange rate for the financial year. Differences arising from currency translation are disclosed
separately within group equity under the item “Equity difference from currency translation”. Currency
differences from both debt consolidation and the elimination of intercompany profits and losses are disclosed in
the income statement under the item “Other operating expenses”.

**IV. Accounting policies**

The annual financial statements included in the consolidated financial statements are prepared applying
uniform accounting policies.

Intangible assets are measured at cost, less straight-line amortization. Concessions, industrial property rights
and similar rights and assets as well as licenses to such rights and assets, with the exception of the brand name,
are amortized over a useful life of three to fifteen years.

Goodwill is amortised, depending on its expected useful life, over a period of five to fifteen years. When
determining the depreciation period, estimates are made as to over which period the acquired business is
expected to produce a positive contribution to results.

A useful life of more than five years has been set for goodwill where the internal development of a
corresponding organisation would have been amortised at the earliest within this period. The brand name
“Birkenstock” included in the intangible assets is amortised over a period of 35 years.

Tangible assets are stated at acquisition cost less scheduled straight-line depreciation. Depreciation is
generally based on the expected useful life or remaining useful life, which are generally estimated as follows:

Land, similar rights and buildings including buildings on leasehold . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 – 50
Technical equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 – 20
Other equipment, factory and office equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 8

Moveable fixed assets with acquisition costs under EUR 250.00 are treated as immediate expense and with
acquisition costs of between EUR 250 and EUR 1,000.00 accounted for in an annual summary account and
depreciated over five years.

The financial assets are stated at acquisition costs or, where there is a permanent de-crease in value, at the
lower fair value at the balance sheet date.

Where there is a permanent decrease in value, unscheduled depreciation is made in or-der to state the fixed
asset at a lower value at the reporting date. When the reasons for impairment losses no longer exist, these can be
reversed by appropriate write-ups, unless this does not relate to impairment of goodwill.

F-19


-----

Under inventories raw materials and supplies and goods purchased are generally measured at the lower of
average acquisition costs and fair value. Work in progress and finished goods are measured at production costs or
at lower fair value at the balance sheet date. In addition to material and wages costs, production costs include
proportionate material and manufacturing overheads including depreciation. Recognisable risks which can, for
example, arise from an above-average storage period or reduced usability are accounted for applying appropriate
write-downs.

Receivables and other assets are capitalised at nominal amounts less necessary allowances or at present
value. In the case of foreign currency receivables, shortterm receivables are translated at the mean spot exchange
rate at the balance sheet date and receivables with a maturity above one year at the lower of the rate at the time
they arose and the mean spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Cash and bank balances are stated at nominal value.

Prepaid expenses and deferred income are recognised for income or expenses which related to a certain
period after the reporting date.

Capital shares of the limited partners are reported at nominal value and are fully paid up. The classification
of the other equity items is in accordance with the provisions of the articles of association of BS KG. The
changes in the individual shareholders’ equity items are all disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in
equity.

Provisions for pension and similar obligations are determined actuarially based on bio-metric probabilities
(Reference Tables 2018 G by Heubeck) using the projected unit credit method. Expected future salary and
pension increases are accounted for in determining the obligations. Currently, annual adjustments amount to
0.00 % p.a. for pension entitlements and 1.50 to 2.50 % p.a. for pensions are used. The interest rate for
calculations for the discounting of pension obligations amounts to 2.41 % p.a. (prior year: 2.82 % p.a.) this is the
average market rate of the past ten years as determined and published by the German Federal Bank for an
assumed remaining term of 15 years. Where reinsurance policies have been taken out to cover the pension
obligations, which are not accessible to all other creditors, the value of the provision was offset against the fair
value of the covering assets.

Tax and other provisions are set up for recognisable risks and uncertain liabilities and measured at the
settlement amount required in accordance with reasonable commercial judgement. Future price and cost
increases were accounted for in determining the settlement amount where necessary. Provisions with a remaining
term of more than one year are discounted at the average market interest rate of the past seven financial years
corresponding to their remaining term.

Liabilities are recognised at their settlement amount. Foreign currency liabilities are translated where current
at the average mean spot rate at the balance sheet date and where non-current at the higher of the rate at the time
they arose and the mean spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Deferred taxes are recognised in the annual financial statements of the consolidated companies for tax
charges and reliefs resulting from differences between the value of assets, liabilities and deferred items under
German commercial code and their tax values, which are expected to reverse in future financial years. The
deferred taxes are measured at individual tax rates of the entities at the time of reversal of the differences.

On determining deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on consolidation measures the consolidation
measures are assigned to the company concerned and the deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the valid
individual tax rates of the relevant group company.

**Inventories**

Inventories comprise shoes and sandals with orthopaedic insoles produced by companies within the
Birkenstock Group, work in progress as well as the raw materials and supplies and goods required for
manufacturing.

The sharp decrease in inventories by kEUR 31,684 in the financial year compared with the previous year is
primarily due to the temporary closure of the production facilities as a result of COVID 19.

**Receivables and other assets**

Receivables and other assets have the following remaining terms:

**Of which** **Of which**
**remaining term** **remaining term**

Other assets include tax receivables amounting to kEUR 5,227 (prior year: kEUR 7,417).

Receivables from affiliated companies consist in the previous year exclusively of other assets.

Furthermore, other assets in the previous year include amounts due from Birkenstock Cosmetics GmbH &
Co. KG amounting to kEUR 18,460.

Trade receivables increased by a total of kEUR 10,555. This is mainly related to kEUR 10,361 higher sales
in September 2020 compared to September 2019.

**Equity**

The shares of the limited partners of BS KG amounting to kEUR 10,000 in total are equivalent to the
liability amounts recorded in the Commercial Register.

The capital reserve set up in accordance with the provisions of the articles of association of BS KG results
from contributions by the limited partners. In the reporting year, a withdrawal of kEUR 29,990 was made from
the capital reserve by shareholders’ resolution of 30 September 2020.

In the financial year 2019/2020, 42 % (prior year 42 %) of BS KG’s net income of 2018/2019 (kEUR
59,647, prior year: kEUR 46,564) was allocated to the statutory reserves in accordance with the provisions of the
articles of association of BS KG by resolution of the shareholders’ meeting on 24 June 2020.

In fiscal year 2019/2020, an amount of kEUR 1,893 was withdrawn from the adjustment item for lower
group earnings in order to adjust the net retained profits in the group to the net retained profits reported in the
annual financial statements of BS KG.

In accordance with the provisions of the articles of association of BS KG, 42 % of the annual net income or
rather kEUR 46,432 shall be transferred at the time of the approval of the annual financial statements of BS KG
from the net profit as at 30 September 2020 to the statutory reserves thus making it inaccessible for distributions.

Equity attributable to minority interests of Birkenstock Immobilien GmbH & Co. KG and Birkenstock
Cosmetics GmbH & Co. KG is included under non-controlling interests.

With regard to changes in individual shareholders’ equity items we refer to the consolidated statement of
changes in equity.

**Pension provisions**

The pension provisions relate to the pension entitlements of former employees which are calculated based
on actuarial principles and comprise the following:

**30.09.2020** **30.09.2019**
_kEUR_ _kEUR_

In accordance with § 253 (6) sentence 2 HGB the discounting of the pension provisions at the average
market interest rate of the past ten years compared to the discounting at the average market interest rate of the
past seven years results in a difference of kEUR 347 (prior year: kEUR 379).

**Other provisions**

Other provisions were formed mainly for personnel expenses (kEUR 22,170, prior year kEUR 22,759),
expenses for pending invoices (kEUR 8,438, prior year: kEUR 9,609) as well as for guarantee obligations (kEUR

Liabilities to banks decreased by kEUR 8,050.

The significant increase in liabilities to shareholders is attributable to dividend payments not yet made.

The liabilities to shareholders and to affiliated companies in both the financial year and the previous year
exclusively include other liabilities.

**Deferred taxes**

The deferred tax liabilities from the annual financial statements of the companies included in the
consolidation amounting to kEUR 20,663 (prior year: kEUR 21,747) relate to temporary differences between the
commercial and tax accounting values of intangible assets (brand name, goodwill) and tangible assets, which
were offset against deferred tax assets of kEUR 2,289 (prior year: kEUR 1,513). The deferred tax assets relate to
temporary differences between the commercial and tax accounting values of the inventories, the receivables as
well as the pension provisions and other provisions.

Deferred tax assets for tax losses carried forward were capitalised to the extent that adequate deferred tax
liabilities were available. These deferred tax assets were offset against the deferred tax liabilities.

Additionally, deferred tax assets amounting to kEUR 6,758 (prior year: kEUR 7,052) resulted from
consolidation measures applied.

F-23


-----

Deferred taxes were based on a tax rate of 14 % in Germany for the group of BS KG (parent of the group)
and this rate was equivalent to an average trade tax rate of the tax group. For the other domestic companies and
the foreign group companies individual corporate tax rates of 14 % to 40 % were set.

**Other operating income**

Other operating income includes, in particular, income relating to other periods from the reversal of
provisions of kEUR 5,821 (previous year: kEUR 3,918) and income from currency translation differences of
kEUR 1,280 (previous year: kEUR 14,870). The significant decrease in income from currency translation is
attributable to the fluctuation in the USD exchange rate.

**Other operating expenses**

The main items included in other operating expenses are logistics expenses of kEUR 66,377 (previous year:
kEUR 49,386), legal and consulting fees of kEUR 19,280 (previous year: kEUR 31,537), advertising expenses of
kEUR 44,573 (previous year: kEUR 39,411), and rental and leasing expenses for real estate of kEUR 25,534
(previous year: kEUR 25,480).

Expenses relating to other periods amounted to kEUR 1,340 (previous year: kEUR 1,903). These include in
particular warranty expenses (kEUR 432) and payments of professional association contributions from previous
years (kEUR 242). In the previous year, expenses relating to other periods resulted in particular from findings of
the tax audit in the amount of kEUR 739.

Expenses from currency translation amounted to kEUR 18,580 (previous year: kEUR 8,801).

**_Valuation unit syndicated loan / EURO Zero Floored Forward Interest Rate Swap_**

In accordance with § 254 HGB, a valuation unit in the form of micro-hedges exists, as EURO zero-floored
forward interest rate swaps were concluded in parallel to hedge interest rate risks from the floating-rate
syndicated loan, so that these borrowings were converted into fixed-rate loans. The loan and derivative volume
amounts to kEUR 100,000 each, whereby the interest rate derivative is split into two sections of kEUR 50,000
each. The fair value of these two interest rate derivatives at the balance sheet date amounts to kEUR -1,647.6 and
kEUR -1,641.7, respectively. The hedge exists in each case for at least the entire term of the underlying
transaction until 30 September 2022. The negative fair value of the interest rate swaps resulting at the balance
sheet date does not have to be recognized as a liability due to the existence of the valuation units using the
freezing method. Effectiveness is ensured by a critical term match.

**Taxes on income**

Taxes on income include income from deferred tax of kEUR 572 (prior year: kEUR 2,349).

**Minority interest in net income**

This consists of the profit attributable to minority interests of Birkenstock Immobilien GmbH & Co. KG and
the loss of Birkenstock Cosmetics GmbH & Co. KG as well as its subsidiary Birkenstock Cosmetics International
GmbH and its US subsidiaries Birkenstock Cosmetics USA GP LLC and Birkenstock Cosmetics USA LP.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

**_authoritative._**

To Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG, Linz am Rhein

**AUDIT OPINIONS**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG, Linz am Rhein,
and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at
30 September 2020, the consolidated statement of profit and loss, the consolidated statement of changes in
equity, and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1 October 2019 to 30 September
2020 and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including the presentation of the recognition and
measurement policies.

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG for the
financial year from 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

   - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the
requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and
financial position of the Group as at 30 September 2020 and of its financial performance for the
financial year from 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020 and

   - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to
the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

**BASIS FOR THE AUDIT OPINIONS**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany]
(IDW).

Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “AUDITOR’S
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF
THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group
entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled
our other German professional responsibilities in compliance with these requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

**RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL**
**STATEMENTS AND THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT**

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law and that the consolidated
financial statements, in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the
executive directors are responsible for such internal controls as they, in accordance with German Legally
Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

F-29


-----

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for for disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going
concern basis of accounting provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent
with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents
the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such
arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group
management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to
provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

**AUDITOR** **RESPONSIBILITIES** **FOR** **THE** **AUDIT** **OF** **THE** **CONSOLIDATED** **FINANCIAL**
**STATEMENTS AND OF THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management
report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent
with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German
legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the
group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

   - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of
the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, and intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

   - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management
report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

   - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

   - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

   - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with
German Legally Required Accounting Principles.

   - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance
of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

   - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its
conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

   - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the
group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence, we evaluate, in
particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions.
We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used
as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the
prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

**III. Consolidation methods**

The capital consolidation is performed using the revaluation method. According to this the carrying value of
the shares of the equity of the subsidiary is to be measured at the amount representing the fair value of the assets,
liabilities, prepaid and accrued items and special items to be taken up in the consolidated financial statements.
The determination of the fair values is performed on the date of the initial consolidation of the subsidiary or
rather when the entity becomes a subsidiary.

A positive amount remaining after offsetting the carrying amounts of the shares with the revalued equity of
the subsidiary is capitalised as goodwill and amortised straight-line over the expected useful life.

Active differences totalling kEUR 24,078 (prior year kEUR 24,078) exist from capital consolidation.

The carrying amount of goodwill capitalised from the capital consolidation as at 30 September 2019
amounts to kEUR 12,890 (prior year kEUR 14,203). In the financial year 2018/19 no unscheduled depreciation
on goodwill was accounted. In the previous year there were unscheduled depreciation of goodwill in the amount
of kEUR 1,445, since the relevant brand names and business activities could not be used further or were
discontinued.

Additionally, as at 30 September 2019 there is negative goodwill from the capital consolidation amounting
in total to kEUR 35,702 (prior year kEUR 35,702). Since the negative goodwill is particularly based on retention
of earnings of the subsidiary in the period before initial consolidation and thus has equity character, it is not
disclosed as a separate item in group equity but included within other revenue reserves.

Minority interests in the equity of consolidated subsidiaries are disclosed within equity under the item
**“Non-controlling interests”. In the group income statement, the profit or loss attributable to minority**
shareholders within group results is shown separately below the net profit for the year.

The consolidation of intercompany balances is performed by elimination of loans, receivables, provisions
and liabilities between the entities included in the consolidated financial statements. If there are liabilities and
receivables between the entities included in the consolidation, for which postponement of priority has been
declared, these are allocated to the consolidated equity or rather to the carrying amount of the shares and
included in the first-time capital consolidation.

Within the elimination of intercompany balances allowances were made to inventories disclosed at the
reporting date which derive from supplies from entities included in the group financial statements totalling kEUR
48,745 (prior year: kEUR 35,148).

The consolidation of income and expenses was performed by offsetting revenues and other operating
income between group companies against the corresponding expenses. Furthermore, interest income and income
from profit and loss transfer agreements are offset against corresponding counter items and intra-group profit
distributions were eliminated.

Where there are differences arising from the consolidation measures between the values of assets, liabilities
or deferred items under German commercial code and their tax values, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
calculated on these to the extent that these differences are expected to reverse in later financial years.

The changes in consolidation items not impacting income and the prior year results of the subsidiaries
generated after the time of initial consolidation are included in or offset against group equity.

The annual financial statements of subsidiaries in foreign currency included in the consolidation are
**translated in accordance with § 308a HGB. Under this rule the assets and liabilities of the balance sheet are**

F-38


-----

translated into Euro at the mean spot exchange rate on the reporting date, except for shareholders’ equity which
is translated at the historic rate at the time of initial consolidation. Items in the income statement are translated at
the average exchange rate for the financial year. Differences arising from currency translation are disclosed
separately within group equity under the item “Equity difference from currency translation”.

**IV. Accounting policies**

The annual financial statements included in the consolidated financial statements are prepared applying
uniform accounting policies.

Intangible assets are measured at cost, less straight-line amortization.

Concessions, industrial property rights and similar rights and assets as well as licenses to such rights and
assets, with the exception of the brand name, are amortized over a useful life of three to fifteen years.

Goodwill is amortised, depending on its expected useful life, over a period of five to fifteen years. When
determining the depreciation period, estimates are made as to over which period the acquired business is
expected to produce a positive contribution to results.

A useful life of more than five years has been set for goodwill where the internal development of a
corresponding organisation would have been amortised at the earliest within this period. The brand name
“Birkenstock” included in the intangible assets is amortised over a period of 35 years.

Tangible assets are stated at acquisition cost less scheduled straight-line depreciation. Depreciation is
generally based on the expected useful life or remaining useful life, which are generally estimated as follows:

Land, similar rights and buildings including buildings on leasehold . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 – 50
Technical equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 – 20
Other equipment, factory and office equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 8

Moveable fixed assets with acquisition costs under EUR 250.00 are treated as immediate expense and with
acquisition costs of between EUR 250 and EUR 1,000.00 accounted for in an annual summary account and
depreciated over five years.

The financial assets are stated at acquisition costs or, where there is a permanent decrease in value, at the
lower fair value at the balance sheet date.

Where there is a permanent decrease in value, unscheduled depreciation is made in order to state the fixed
asset at a lower value at the reporting date. When the reasons for impairment losses no longer exist, these can be
reversed by appropriate write-ups, unless this does not relate to impairment of goodwill.

Under inventories raw materials and supplies and goods purchased are generally measured at the lower of
average acquisition costs and fair value. Work in progress and finished goods are measured at production costs or
at lower fair value at the balance sheet date. In addition to material and wages costs, production costs include
proportionate material and manufacturing overheads including depreciation. Recognisable risks which can, for
example, arise from an above-average storage period or reduced usability are accounted for applying appropriate
write-downs.

Receivables and other assets are capitalised at nominal amounts less necessary allowances or at present
value. In the case of foreign currency receivables, short-term receivables are translated at the mean spot exchange
rate at the balance sheet date and receivables with a maturity above one year at the lower of the rate at the time
they arose and the mean spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Cash and bank balances are stated at nominal value.

Prepaid expenses and deferred income are recognised for income or expenses which related to a certain
period after the reporting date.

Capital shares of the limited partners are reported at nominal value and are fully paid up. The classification
of the other equity items is in accordance with the provisions of the articles of association of BS KG. The
changes in the individual shareholders’ equity items are all disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in
equity.

Provisions for pension and similar obligations are determined actuarially based on biometric probabilities
(Reference Tables 2018 G by Heubeck) using the projected unit credit method. Expected future salary and
pension increases are accounted for in determining the obligations. Currently, annual adjustments amount to

F-39


-----

0.00 % p.a. for pension entitlements and 1.50 % p.a. to 2.50 % p.a. for pensions are used. The interest rate for
calculations for the discounting of pension obligations amounts to 2.82 % p.a. (prior year: 3.34 % p.a.) this is the
average market rate of the past ten years as determined and published by the German Federal Bank for an
assumed remaining term of 15 years. Where reinsurance policies have been taken out to cover the pension
obligations, which are not accessible to all other creditors, the value of the provision was offset against the fair
value of the covering assets.

Tax and other provisions are set up for recognisable risks and uncertain liabilities and measured at the
settlement amount required in accordance with reasonable commercial judgement. Future price and cost
increases were accounted for in determining the settlement amount where necessary. Provisions with a remaining
term of more than one year are discounted at the average market interest rate of the past seven financial years
corresponding to their remaining term.

Liabilities are recognised at their settlement amount. Foreign currency liabilities are translated where current
at the average mean spot rate at the balance sheet date and where non-current at the higher of the rate at the time
they arose and the mean spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Deferred taxes are recognised in the annual financial statements of the consolidated companies for tax
charges and reliefs resulting from differences between the value of assets, liabilities and deferred items under
German commercial code and their tax values, which are expected to reverse in future financial years. The
deferred taxes are measured at individual tax rates of the entities at the time of reversal of the differences.

On determining deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on consolidation measures the consolidation
measures are assigned to the company concerned and the deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the valid
individual tax rates of the relevant group company.

**V.** **Explanations to the group balance sheet**

**Fixed assets**

The classification of the summarised items of fixed assets and their development are presented in the fixed
asset movement schedule below.

F-40


-----

F-41


-----

Intangible fixed assets amounting to kEUR 176,689 relate to the brand name “Birkenstock”. As a result of
amortisation and investments (kEUR 6,684), the intangible fixed assets changed by kEUR 4,088).

Tangible fixed assets increased by kEUR 15,198. This is mainly due to investments in production facilities.

Due to a change in the planned use of the property Burg Ockenfels an impairment loss of kEUR 4,500 was
accounted for in the prior year.

The shares in affiliated companies relate to the companies not included in the consolidated financial
statements due to their minor materiality.

**Inventories**

Inventories comprise shoes and sandals with orthopaedic insoles produced by companies within the
Birkenstock Group, work in progress as well as the raw materials and supplies and goods required for
manufacturing.

Inventories increased by EUR 36,889 thousand to ensure better availability of goods and adherence to
delivery dates.

**Receivables and other assets**

Receivables and other assets have the following remaining terms:

**of which** **of which**
**remaining term** **remaining term**
**more than 1** **more than 1**
**year** **year**

74,285 910 83,122 54

Other assets include tax receivables amounting to kEUR 7,417 (prior year: 7,069).

Receivables from affiliated companies consist in the current as well as the previous year exclusively of other
assets.

Furthermore, other assets include amounts due from Birkenstock Cosmetics GmbH & Co. KG amounting to
kEUR 18,460 (prior year: kEUR 12,480).

Trade receivables decreased by a total of TEUR 8,142. This is mainly due to the special campaign for the
French market, which was produced and invoiced shortly before the previous year’s reporting date. There was no
similar promotion in the 2019 financial year in the same period.

**Equity**

The shares of the limited partners of BS KG amounting to kEUR 10,000 in total are equivalent to the
liability amounts recorded in the Commercial Register.

The capital reserve set up in accordance with the provisions of the articles of association of BS KG results
from contributions by the limited partners.

In the financial year 2018/2019, 42 % (prior year 15 %) of BS KG’s net income of 2018/2019 (kEUR
46,564 (prior year: kEUR 10,917)) was allocated to the statutory reserves in accordance with the provisions of
the articles of association of BS KG by resolution of the shareholders’ meeting on 07. May 2019.

The other revenue reserves mainly include the negative goodwill amounts from the capital consolidation
which relate to the retention of earnings of the consolidated entities before initial consolidation.

In the financial year 2018/2019 a transfer of kEUR 5,785 from the groups’ revenue reserves was made and
an amount of kEUR 9,853 was transferred to the adjustment item for lower consolidated earnings in order to
reconcile the group net profit to the net profit in the annual financial statements of BS KG.

F-42


-----

In accordance with the provisions of the articles of association of BS KG, 42 % of the annual net income or
rather kEUR 59,646 shall be transferred at the time of the approval of the annual financial statements of BS KG
from the net profit as at 30 September 2019 to the statutory reserves thus making it inaccessible for distributions.

Equity attributable to minority interests of Birkenstock Immobilien GmbH & Co. KG is included under
non-controlling interests.

With regard to changes in individual shareholders’ equity items we refer to the consolidated statement of
changes in equity.

**Pension provisions**

The pension provisions relate to the pension entitlements of former employees which are calculated based
on actuarial principles and comprise the following:

**30.09.2019** **30.09.2018**
**kEUR** **kEUR**
Settlement amount of the pension obligations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,162 4,863

Excess of the obligations over assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,204 1,820

In accordance with § 253 (6) sentence 2 HGB the discounting of the pension provisions at the average
market interest rate of the past ten years compared to the discounting at the average market interest rate of the
past seven years results in a difference of kEUR 379 (prior year: kEUR 424).

**Other provisions**

Other provisions were formed mainly for personnel expenses (kEUR 22,759, prior year kEUR 18,322),
expenses for pending invoices (kEUR 9,609, prior year: kEUR 10,037) as well as for guarantee obligations
(kEUR 2,995, prior year: kEUR 2,715).

182,526 72,075 110,451 0 219,316 54,716 164,600 0

The significant increase in liabilities to shareholders is due to dividend payments not yet made. Due to the
good earnings situation, the revolving loan could be reduced by kEUR 54,149.

The liabilities to shareholders and to affiliated companies in both the financial year and the previous year
exclusively include other liabilities.

**Deferred tax**

The deferred tax liabilities from the annual financial statements of the companies included in the
consolidation amounting to kEUR 21,747 (prior year: kEUR 21,566) relate to temporary differences between the
commercial and tax accounting values of intangible assets (brand name, goodwill) and tangible assets, which

F-43


-----

were offset against deferred tax assets of kEUR 1,513 (prior year: kEUR 1,456). The deferred tax assets relate to
temporary differences between the commercial and tax accounting values of the inventories, the receivables as
well as the pension provisions and other provisions.

Deferred tax assets for tax losses carried forward were capitalised to the extent that adequate deferred tax
liabilities were available. These deferred tax assets were offset against the deferred tax liabilities.

Additionally, deferred tax assets amounting to kEUR 7,052 (prior year: kEUR 5,148 resulted from
consolidation measures applied.)

Deferred taxes were based on a tax rate of 14 % in Germany for the group of BS KG (parent of the group)
and this rate was equivalent to an average trade tax rate of the tax group. For the other domestic companies and
the foreign group companies individual corporate tax rates of 14 % to 40 % were set.

Deferred taxes developed in the financial year as follows:

**Balance at** **Change** **Balance at**
**01.10.2018** **Financial year** **30.09.2019**

**kEUR** **kEUR** **kEUR**

To Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG, Linz am Rhein

**AUDIT OPINIONS**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG, Linz am Rhein,
and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30.
September 2019, the consolidated statement of profit and loss, the consolidated statement of changes in equity,
and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1. October 2018 to 30. September 2019
and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including the presentation of the recognition and measurement
policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Birkenstock GmbH & Co. KG for the
financial year from 1. October 2018 to 30. September 2019 .

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

   - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the
requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and
financial position of the Group as at 30. September 2019 and of its financial performance for the
financial year from 1. October 2018 to 30. September 2019 and

   - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to
the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

**BASIS FOR THE AUDIT OPINIONS**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany]
(IDW).

Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “AUDITOR’S
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF
THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group
entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled
our other German professional responsibilities in compliance with these requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

**RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL**
**STATEMENTS AND THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT**

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law and that the consolidated
financial statements, in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the
executive directors are responsible for such internal controls as they, in accordance with German Legally
Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for for disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going
concern basis of accounting provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent
with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents
the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such
arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group
management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to
provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

**AUDITOR** **RESPONSIBILITIES** **FOR** **THE** **AUDIT** **OF** **THE** **CONSOLIDATED** **FINANCIAL**
**STATEMENTS AND OF THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management
report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent
with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German
legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the
group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement.Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

   - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of
the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, and intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

   - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management
report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

   - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

   - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

   - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with
German Legally Required Accounting Principles.

   - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance
of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

   - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its
conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

   - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the
group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence, we evaluate, in
particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions.
We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used
as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the
prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.
