(the “Target” and, together with Arcaplanet (as defined herein), the “Target Group”) from Permira and Winch (each, as defined herein) (the “Arcaplanet Acquisition”). The Arcaplanet Acquisition is expected to close concurrently with, or shortly after (i) an acquisition by Topco (as defined herein) of the entire issued share capital of Maxi Zoo Italia S.p.A. (“Maxi Zoo”), a joint stock company (società per azioni) incorporated under the laws of Italy, from Fressnapf Beteiligungs GmbH (“Fressnapf”) in exchange of an issuance of certain new shares by Topco to Fressnapf (the “Maxi Zoo Acquisition”); and (ii) subsequent contributions of Maxi Zoo by (a) Topco to Midco (as defined herein) and (b) by Midco to the Issuer (all such transactions, collectively, the “Maxi Zoo Contribution”). See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Summary— _Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.”_ The Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per annum.

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. See “Description of the Notes.” Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, and pending consummation of the Arcaplanet Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will deposit the gross proceeds of the Notes into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) held in the name of, and controlled by, the Escrow Agent (as defined herein).

For example, IFRS reporting standards including, but not limited to, “IFRS 9—Financial Instruments,” “IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and “IFRS 16—Leases”, differ to current Italian GAAP reporting standards. See “Summary of Certain Differences _between Italian GAAP and IFRS” for a discussion of these and certain other significant differences. Future_ developments or changes in Italian GAAP and IFRS may give rise to additional differences between Italian GAAP and IFRS. In the future, we may choose to report our financial results in accordance with IFRS. Due to this, our future financial statements could be materially different once we commence reporting under IFRS and may not be comparable to the Agrifarma Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Agrifarma—Key _Factors Affecting Agrifarma’s Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to our Business and Industry—The Financial Statements are based on Italian GAAP and there may be differences between our financial position and results of operations prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP and IFRS or U.S. GAAP. In addition, in the future, we may adopt IFRS as our accounting reporting method, and this could potentially result in material changes to certain of our financial information from our information presented in this offering memorandum.”_ The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Italian GAAP requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the board of directors to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies.

As at June 30, 2021, Arcaplanet had 382 stores (including 371 stores of Agrifarma and 11 stores of Agrifarma Subsidiaries (Arcaplanet S.A., Arcawip S.r.l. and First One S.r.l.)) and Maxi Zoo had 130 stores; therefore, following completion of the Transactions we will have Italy’s largest network of 512 specialized pet care stores. Arcaplanet’s in-store services include “Self Wash” (self-service washing machines and dryers for pet clothing and accessories), “Pet Wash” (dedicated self-service facilities for pet grooming with adjacent hair dryer areas), “Agility” (dedicated areas for dog training and entertainment) and “Para-pharmacy” (through which we offer non-prescription veterinary drugs). In addition to its extensive store network, Arcaplanet offers its products through a leading proprietary e-commerce platform with 7.3 million active users as at June 30, 2021. Through its stores and e-commerce platform, Arcaplanet offers a diverse range of pet food, accessories, and health products under its 18 own exclusive proprietary brands (the “Exclusive Brands”) and under more than 100 third-party brands. It categorizes its Exclusive Brands in the following segments: “Specialist,” “Super Premium,” “Premium” and “Mainstream.” Arcaplanet primarily focuses on the first three segments, which have higher margins. Sales of Exclusive Brands products generated 25.1%, 31.9%, 40.8% and 44.4% of Agrifarma’s revenue from sales and services for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. The graphics below present Arcaplanet’s assortment of its Exclusive Brands: #### Pet food Pet accessories Health products In addition, Maxi Zoo has a largely complementary exclusive brand offering with a significant margin upside (as it currently offers exclusive brands products in all of the above higher margin segments). Following completion of the Transactions, we expect to capture this margin upside through the combination of store networks and the harmonization of product assortment within the Combined Group. Since our founding in 1995, we have grown both organically and through acquisitions (see “Business— _Arcaplanet—Distribution—Stores—Recent acquisitions”). The Combined Group is expected to have one of_ the largest shares (approximately pro forma 13% for the year ended December 31, 2020) of the €3.5 billion Italian pet care market. We have a large and loyal customer base with approximately 1.5 million Arcaclub[®] loyalty program members as at June 30, 2021, who generate up to 80% of Arcaplanet’s in-store revenue from retail sales. The “ARCAPLANET” brand enjoys high awareness levels in Italy (91% as of 2021) and we have ----- the highest off-line and online Net Promoter Scores compared to all other competitors in the country. Arcaplanet is currently building a state-of-the-art facility for the manufacturing of dry pet food in San Vito al Tagliamento, Friuli-Venezia Giulia (the “Tagliamento Facility”), which will make us the first vertically integrated only-Italian pet products and services specialist with its own dry pet food production capabilities. Upon commencement of operations, which is currently expected by August 2022, the Tagliamento Facility will ensure full control over the production cycle of dry pet food for our key Exclusive Brands and is expected to significantly enhance product quality, R&D focus and reduce costs. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021: Agrifarma had €305.9 million, €339.2 million and €369.1 million of revenue from sales and services, respectively and (ii) Maxi Zoo had €108.9 million, €124.6 million and €142.3 million of revenue from sales and services, respectively.

1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,We are a leading player in one of the most attractive pet care markets in Europe,"We operate in the Italian pet care market, which is one of the most attractive markets in Europe with significant size, consistent growth and resilience and high level of fragmentation. Following the completion of the Transactions, we expected to continue benefiting from these structural factors due to our leading market position (see “—We have an extensive physical network and a solid position in the nascent online segment, _supported by a superior brand recognition, high customer satisfaction and a premium price positioning”)._ According to a leading international consulting firm, the Italian pet care market has been experiencing consistent year-on-year growth at a CAGR of approximately 2-3% for more than a decade, reaching approximately €3.5 billion by the end of 2020. This growth has been driven by what is referred to as pet “humanization,” which is the tendency of owners to consider their pets as family members. Due to such “humanization” and the increasing concerns relating to pets’ health and well-being, owners are willing to pay a premium for high quality products for their pets (the so called “premiumization”). In addition, the Italian pet care market’s growth experienced a strong acceleration in 2020 largely due to increasing pet adoption rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to continue well beyond 2021 leading to a run-rate growth rate of approximately 5% by 2025. The Italian pet care market’s highly resilient, non-discretionary nature has been evident throughout numerous economic downturns, such as the global financial crisis between mid 2007 and early 2009, the Eurozone sovereign financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, during which it continued to grow consistently despite overall GDP contractions. For example, during the global financial crisis, Italian GDP decreased by 3.7% from 2008 to 2009, whereas, according to a leading international consulting firm, the country’s pet care market grew by 4.9%, by value, during the same period. Outside Italy, such resilience of the pet care industry has been demonstrated across all major markets, including the UK, Germany, France, Spain and the US. From a structural perspective, the Italian pet care market still has a very large share of independent (“mom & pop”) stores (particularly when compared to other mature European markets). According to a leading international consulting firm, in 2020, independent (“mom & pop”) stores had an approximately 37% share, by revenue, of the Italian pet care market, compared to approximately 6% in Germany and approximately 8% in the UK. At the same time, specialist retail chains had an approximately 17% share, by revenue, of the Italian pet care market, compared to approximately 44% in Germany and approximately 28% in the UK. Therefore, there is significant room in Italy for specialist retail chains to continue growing in competition with smaller independent players and grocery stores. According to a leading international consulting firm, over the last 5 years, independent (“mom & pop”) stores in Italy lost an approximately 8% market share to specialist retail chains. We expect this trend to continue. In addition, pet care markets have unique and protected distribution dynamics, which are very attractive for large omni-channel specialist players. A critical success factor in distributing pet food is the ability to handle a significant amount of bulky, heavy and relatively low priced (per Kg) SKUs, which can only be achieved via a developed network of physical stores and makes it less appealing for pure online players, given significant ----- related logistical costs. For these reasons, online penetration in the pet care market (even in major countries, such as the UK and Germany where internet penetration for online shopping is particularly high) has been increasing relatively slowly to date at approximately 1 percentage point of market share gain per year. As a result, omni-channel players, which combine physical and online distribution and have large and loyal customer bases, have captured solid positions across all sales channels (including online) in their respective markets. Over the recent years, such specialized omni-channel pet care chains (including Arcaplanet) have built strong e-commerce capabilities and currently offer a multi-channel experience to their customer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

For the same period, the_ second largest specialist pet care chain had a market share of approximately 4%. With 382 stores as at June 30, 2021, Arcaplanet has the largest physical store network in Italy. The extensive footprint of Arcaplanet’s network allows it to: 1. be in close proximity to customers, showcase its broad product offering and provide best-in-class complementary advice and services. Pet care industry continues to be primarily driven by the physical channel, due to the importance of in-store shopping experience, including complementary advice and services. In addition, certain products (such as lower cost pet foods) come in big and bulky packages, which are more difficult to sell online; 2. benefit from greater relative bargaining power when negotiating with pet food manufacturers; 3. significantly improve its “ARCAPLANET” Brand Awareness; 4. increase the quality and assortment of products and complementary services, providing what we believe to be best-in-class “one-stop-shop”experience to customers with longer opening hours, less queuing and wider assortment. We believe that the Maxi Zoo Acquisition will put the Combined Group in a favorable position to seize the full potential of the addressable market. As at June 30, 2021, pro forma for the Transactions, our network consisted of 512 stores with an established presence in northern Italian regions for both Arcaplanet and Maxi Zoo.

According to a leading international consulting firm, more than 60% of Arcaplanet clients purchase pet products only at Arcaplanet Stores (compared to 24% for the closest competitor), while more than 85% of them consider “ARCAPLANET” as their brand of reference when purchasing for their pets. The loyal and constantly growing base of 1.5 million Arcacard[®] cardholders (as at June 30, 2021) generates over 75% of Agrifarma’s revenue from sales and services. The Arcaclub[®] loyalty program provides Arcaplanet with intimate knowledge of its customers’ spending habits and needs, allowing it to continuously evaluate its offering of products and services. In 2017—2020, the Arcacard[®] cardholders base increased from 0.9 million to 1.3 million, at a CAGR of 13.5%. During the same period: (i) the number of high-spender (over €250 yearly spend) Arcacard[®] cardholders increased from approximately 184,000 to approximately 308,000, at a CAGR of 19.0%; and (ii) average spending in this customer group increased from approximately €540 per year to approximately €560 per year.

From 2018 to 2020, Agrifarma’s revenue from retail sales through the E-commerce Platform grew at a CAGR of 45.0% (compared to 19.0% CAGR of a leading pure player in the market), driven by significant improvements in the number of online sessions (from 7.2 million to 14.4 million) and conversion rate (from 1.8% to 2.2%). Arcaplanet is the only specialist pet food retailer in the market with a meaningful online presence and was the most searched online Italian pet care market player in 2020. Given the cash flows that are generated by Arcaplanet’s extensive physical store network, we are able to invest in both channels and provide an attractive shop-like online experience and an extensive product offering, compared to pure online players that have historically tended to reduce the number of SKUs. For each of the year ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the E-commerce Platform generated €23.6 million of revenue from retail sales. We expect that the strength of our online offering will allow us to capitalize on the further growth of the Italian online pet care market, which is expected to reach a penetration of 12-16% by 2025 in line with trajectories seen in similar European countries, accelerated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A�er consolida�on, Maxi Zoo stores will be rebranded “Arcaplanet” ----- Arcaplanet’s performance in both the physical and the online channels has been driven by its superior brand recognition, high customer satisfaction and premium price positioning. According to a leading international consulting firm, “ARCAPLANET” is among the most recognized specialist pet care brands in Italy with 91% Brand Awareness as of 2021. Arcaplanet has been continuously investing in its overall Brand Awareness, the awareness of its Exclusive Products and other marketing initiatives. Over the last years, Agrifarma’s advertising costs have increased significantly from €6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which we believe is significantly higher than that of any other pet care chain in Italy. In addition, according to a leading international consulting firm, Arcaplanet has demonstrated high levels of customer satisfaction in both the physical and the online channels with a Net Promoter Score of 43 in the offline market (with the next closest competitor having a Net Promoter Score of 37) and Net Promoter Score of 57 in the online market (with the next closest competitor having a Net Promoter Score of 44), all as of 2021. These consistent investments in marketing and customer satisfaction over many years have allowed Arcaplanet to ensure a very attractive premium price positioning within the market. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, more than 75% of Arcaplanet’s combined revenue from sales of pet food under Exclusive Brands came from sales of “Specialist” (price above €5 per Kg) and “Super Premium” (price between €4 and €5 per Kg) segments. We followed a similar strategy with regards to the assortment of third party brands offering, which are mainly focused on the premium, super premium and specialist segments, allowing Arcaplanet to take advantage of the “humanization”and premiumization trends of the Italian pet care market.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

It will be built in accordance with the highest technology standards, ensuring improved control over product quality and R&D. Once operational, the Tagliamento Facility is expected to enable us to internalize the margin currently paid out to third party manufacturers and further realize production and operational cost savings. With current volumes of dry pet food sold under our Exclusive Brands, the Tagliamento Facility is expected to contribute to further increases of our Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. We currently expect the Tagliamento Facility to begin operations by August 2022 and estimate the overall cost of construction to be approximately €45 million. In accordance with Italian Ministerial Decree of December 9, 2014 (Development contracts: adjustment of rules on state aid), Invitalia, Italy’s National Agency for Inward Investment and Economic Development, provides state support to projects that are expected to significantly advance the country’s economic development. In August and December 2020, Arcaplanet filed two separate applications to Invitalia for state co-funding of, in aggregate, approximately €17 million, or 40%, of the Tagliamento Facility’s then expected total construction costs. As part of the application process, Arcaplanet submitted detailed documentation relating to the proposed construction and expected impact of the Tagliamento Facility on local and national economies. Both applications have been approved. Although there is no definitive schedule for Arcaplanet’s receipt of funds, we expect the first tranche of approximately €9 million to be made available during the course of 2022 and the second tranche of approximately €8 million in 2022 or 2023. In addition, instead of receiving lump sums up front, Arcaplanet is entitled to claim reimbursement of actual costs incurred up to the aggregate approximately €17 million limit. Arcaplanet will be under no obligation to repay any money it receives from Invitalia and no such funding will be subject to any additional conditions other than compliance with the terms of the underlying applications. If required, we expect to be able to double the currently planned 60 kiloton dry pet food capacity of the Tagliamento Facility with limited investments. We will also have the option to buy adjacent land to build a 60 ----- kiloton wet pet food facility. Internalization of the production process and the associated full control over the R&D activity is expected to accelerate innovation and reduce the time to market of our Exclusive Brands products. The Tagliamento Facility is expected to be cost efficient due to the minimization of human interaction and its industry 4.0 design that enables remote control and 100% product traceability. It is expected to be compliant with the highest safety and environmental standards, which will make it eligible for six ISO certifications. The Tagliamento Facility is currently expected to become operational in August 2022. Our Tagliamento Facility for manufacturing dry pet food will make us the first only-Italian verticallyintegrated pet specialist business in the country. It will be built in accordance with the highest technology standards, ensuring improved control over product quality and R&D. Once operational, the Tagliamento Facility is expected to enable us to internalize the margin currently paid out to third party manufacturers and further realize production and operational cost savings. With current volumes of dry pet food sold under our Exclusive Brands, the Tagliamento Facility is expected to contribute to further increases of our Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. We currently expect the Tagliamento Facility to begin operations by August 2022 and estimate the overall cost of construction to be approximately €45 million. In accordance with Italian Ministerial Decree of December 9, 2014 (Development contracts: adjustment of rules on state aid), Invitalia, Italy’s National Agency for Inward Investment and Economic Development, provides state support to projects that are expected to significantly advance the country’s economic development. In August and December 2020, Arcaplanet filed two separate applications to Invitalia for state co-funding of, in aggregate, approximately €17 million, or 40%, of the Tagliamento Facility’s then expected total construction costs. As part of the application process, Arcaplanet submitted detailed documentation relating to the proposed construction and expected impact of the Tagliamento Facility on local and national economies. Both applications have been approved. Although there is no definitive schedule for Arcaplanet’s receipt of funds, we expect the first tranche of approximately €9 million to be made available during the course of 2022 and the second tranche of approximately €8 million in 2022 or 2023. In addition, instead of receiving lump sums up front, Arcaplanet is entitled to claim reimbursement of actual costs incurred up to the aggregate approximately €17 million limit. Arcaplanet will be under no obligation to repay any money it receives from Invitalia and no such funding will be subject to any additional conditions other than compliance with the terms of the underlying applications. ----- If required, we expect to be able to double the currently planned 60 kiloton dry pet food capacity of the Tagliamento Facility with limited investments. We will also have the option to buy adjacent land to build a 60 kiloton wet pet food facility. Internalization of the production process and the associated full control over the R&D activity is expected to accelerate innovation and reduce the time to market of our Exclusive Brands products. The Tagliamento Facility is expected to be cost efficient due to the minimization of human interaction and its industry 4.0 design that enables remote control and 100% product traceability. It is expected to be compliant with the highest safety and environmental standards, which will make it eligible for six ISO certifications. The Tagliamento Facility is currently expected to become operational in August 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

In particular, we have identified certain initiatives and synergy levers that will strengthen our financial profile through cost rationalization. Following a detailed review of operations of Arcaplanet and Maxi Zoo, several operational initiatives have been identified as part of the Transformation Program. For instance, harmonization of product offerings in conjunction with the rebranding of Maxi Zoo Stores in accordance with the Arcaplanet Store Format is expected to deliver a €5.8 million impact on our Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. We are confident that such alignment can be achieved given our substantial track record of successful integration projects. In addition, currently both businesses operate their own headquarters with two management teams in place, which creates significant headroom for cost reductions.

We currently expect the Arcaplanet Acquisition to complete during the course of March 2022. The consummation of the Arcaplanet Acquisition is, however, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including customary antitrust approvals and the performance of certain closing actions. The Issuer has agreed to take all necessary steps to obtain the required clearances following the signing of the Arcaplanet Purchase Agreement. If such closing conditions have not been fulfilled or waived by the last day of the eight month following the one in which the Arcaplanet Purchase Agreement was executed, the Arcaplanet Purchase Agreement may be terminated. The Arcaplanet Purchase Agreement contains customary warranties given by the Sellers as to capacity, title and certain business matters as well as customary signing to closing covenants given by the Sellers regarding, ----- among other things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of Arcaplanet pending closing of the Arcaplanet Acquisition. The Sellers’ liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations. See “The Transactions—Arcaplanet Acquisition” for additional details on the Arcaplanet Acquisition. _Maxi Zoo Contribution_ Also on June 24, 2021, Seventh Cinven Fund (No. 1) Limited Partnership (the “Seventh Cinven Fund”), Topco and Fressnapf entered into the Maxi Zoo Acquisition Agreement. Under the terms of such Maxi Zoo Acquisition Agreement, Topco will purchase the Maxi Zoo Shares from Fressnapf in exchange for an issuance of certain new shares in Topco to Fressnapf (concurrently with the direct or indirect subscription for certain additional new shares in Topco by each of the Seventh Cinven Fund (and/or its permitted assignees) and Fressnapf). We currently expect the Maxi Zoo Acquisition to complete shortly before, or substantially concurrently with, the Arcaplanet Acquisition. In accordance with the Maxi Zoo Acquisition Agreement, the consummation of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition is subject to certain antitrust approvals and the performance of certain closing actions. As soon as practicable after the completion of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition: (i) Topco will contribute (directly or indirectly) the Maxi Zoo Shares to Midco and (ii) Midco will contribute such Maxi Zoo Shares to the Issuer. The Maxi Zoo Acquisition and such subsequent contributions are, collectively, referred to in this offering memorandum as the “Maxi Zoo Contribution”. Fressnapf will be a strategic investor in the Combined Group (see “Principal Shareholders” and “—Our Strategy—Maintain financial discipline to _support deleveraging”) and following completion of the transactions envisaged by the Maxi Zoo Acquisition_ Agreement and the Arcaplanet Purchase Agreement, Cinven and Fressnapf will become majority shareholders in the Combined Group with the governance rights described in “Related Party Transactions—Shareholders’ _Agreement.”_ The Investors remain committed to complete both transactions as soon as practicable following satisfaction of the applicable closing conditions (see “The Transactions.”) The Maxi Zoo Acquisition Agreement contains customary warranties given by Fressnapf as to capacity, title and certain business matters, as well as customary signing to closing covenants given by Fressnapf regarding, among other things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of Maxi Zoo pending closing of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition. Fressnapf’s liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations. In addition, pursuant to the Maxi Zoo Acquisition Agreement, Fressnapf has agreed, in order to facilitate the ability of Maxi Zoo to operate outside of Fressnapf’s wider organization following completion of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition, to provide, or procure the provision by other Fressnapf entities, of certain services to Maxi Zoo until such time as Fressnapf and Topco otherwise agree, and for such consideration as may be agreed between them. See “The Transactions—Maxi Zoo Contribution” for additional details on the Maxi Zoo Contribution and “Related Party Transactions” for additional details on such arrangements between Fressnapf and Topco. _Financing_ Assuming the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date occurs in March 2022, we expect that the consideration for the Arcaplanet Acquisition will be financed by: (i) a direct or indirect cash equity contribution from the Investors and management to the Issuer on or about the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date in an estimated aggregate amount of €499.6 million (the “Cash Equity Contribution”); and (ii) a portion of the proceeds of the Offering in an estimated aggregate amount of €449.3 million. A portion of the Offering proceeds in an estimated aggregate amount of approximately €100 million is also expected to be used to refinance the Existing UniCredit Facilities. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing UniCredit Facilities _Agreement.” The Cash Equity Contribution, the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom are collectively_ referred to in this offering memorandum as the “Financing.” In addition, on or prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Revolving Facility Agreement, under which a €80.0 million super senior revolving credit facility (the “Original Revolving Facility”) will be made available to the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries on the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility Agreement will be available for general corporate and working capital purposes. For a more detailed description of the Revolving Facility Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Revolving Facility Agreement.”We currently expect no amounts to be drawn in cash under the_ Original Revolving Facility on the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date. See “Capitalization.” ----- _Post Closing Mergers_ Within approximately 15 months of the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, we expect to merge the Issuer, the Target and Maxi Zoo into Agrifarma, with Agrifarma being the ultimate surviving entity, all pursuant to Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code (such transactions, “Post Closing Mergers”). Following the completion of the Post Closing Mergers, Agrifarma will be substituted as the issuer of the Notes. While we intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Post Closing Mergers, their completion will be subject to certain conditions and may not occur within the currently envisaged time frame or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may be unable to complete the Post Closing _Mergers within the anticipated time frame, or at all.” Following the Post Closing Mergers, and to the extent_ applicable, certain security interests in the Collateral may be released. In addition, certain other security interests in the Collateral may be confirmed, extended and/or granted (as applicable) in accordance with the covenants described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.” In this offering memorandum, we refer to the Arcaplanet Acquisition, the Maxi Zoo Contribution, the Financing, the entry into the Revolving Facility Agreement and the Post Closing Mergers, collectively, as the “Transactions”.

COVID-19 pandemic_ Our business has demonstrated a significant degree of resilience to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Pet food shops are considered to be essential businesses pursuant to the Italian Ministerial Decree No. 76 of March 22, 2020, and thus our stores were allowed to remain open despite the lockdowns and other government restrictions put in place in Italy during the pandemic. In addition, because pet products (especially pet food) are generally considered non-discretionary spend for many pet owners, sales through our E-Commerce Platform increased during the COVID-19 crisis. However, for periods of time since the start of the pandemic we have seen lower store sales in many locations due to reduced number of customers visiting our stores and stores’ opening schedules being restricted, particularly during periods where more stringent restrictions were in place in Italy. In addition, we had to incur additional cost to introduce extended hygiene measures (such as requirements to provide disinfectants, ----- wear masks and limits on the number of customers in our stores) for the health and safety of our customers and employees. Management estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an approximately €8.0 million and €3.7 million negative impact on Agrifarma’s revenue from sales and services for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. In addition, Agrifarma’s operating expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic are estimated at approximately €1.8 million and €0.2 million for the same periods. _Trading update_ Arcaplanet and Maxi Zoo continued to trade in line with their respective management’s expectations in the one-month period ended July 31, 2021, with growth in revenue from sales and services and Arcaplanet Adjusted EBITDA and Maxi Zoo Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, both compared to the same one-month period ended July 31, 2020. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Originally a traditional pet food wholesale distributor, we opened the first “ARCAPLANET”branded store in 1998. Taking advantage of the growing fondness of Italian households for pets, we launched several additional stores in the early 2000s, growing our network to 11 stores by the end of 2005. In 2005, the newly founded Italian private equity firm, Credem, chose us as its first investment and acquired 60% of our share capital. In 2010, we were acquired by funds advised by Motion Equity Partners. Our first ever advertisement was aired on Italian television in 2013. In 2014, we launched our first e-commerce “Magento” platform. In 2015, we launched our first Exclusive Brand, Next[®] (see “—Arcaplanet—Products and Services— Products—Pet food—Exclusive Brands”). In the same year, we launched the Arcaclub[®]_ loyalty program (see “—Arcaplanet—Marketing and Promotion—Arcaclub[®] _loyalty program”). ----- In 2016, we were acquired by Permira.

Each store is headed by a store manager that reports to their respective area manager. In turn, area managers report to one of the three regional managers (for the North-West, North-East and Central-South regions). The regional managers report directly to the Head of Operations in Arcaplanet’s HQ. Since the introduction of the Arcaplanet Store Format in 2017 (see “—History”), Arcaplanet has been refurbishing the Arcaplanet Stores to better display its assortment of goods (including those sold under Exclusive Brands) and improve the in-store experience for customers. Refurbishments are performed by third-party suppliers, who are selected from at least three competitors via a tender process. The implementation of each refurbishment is monitored by the Maintenance and Facility Management Department, see “—Procurement and Maintenance—Maintenance of Stores.” Arcaplanet categorizes such refurbishments into “light”, “medium” and “total” refurbishments as follows: - Light: only external appearance modifications, such as signboard and window sticker. - Medium: complete external and internal refurbishment, excluding systems and floor. - Total: complete external and internal refurbishment, including systems and floor. ----- In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the six months ended June 30, 2021, Arcaplanet refurbished 66 stores (all of which were “light”refurbishments), 46 stores (nine “light”, 36 “medium”and one “total” refurbishment), 33 stores (eleven “light”, 15 “medium” and seven “total” refurbishments) and 6 stores (all of which were “total” refurbishments), respectively. The Arcaplanet Store Format has proven versatile, with strong performance across different locations and sizes, driven by Arcaplanet’s ability to optimize product category mix and cost structure, which resulted in a consistent profit and loss structure across the entire network. Once established, it usually takes about three years for a new Arcaplanet Store to achieve maturity. Arcaplanet Stores have generally demonstrated consistent performance across the network, with average revenue from sales and services of €1 million and average EBITDA margin of 24.9% in the year ended December 31, 2020. Historically, the rate of Arcaplanet Stores closures has been low, and such closures have mostly been for the purpose of replacing current smaller stores with larger, more modern ones. Some acquired stores can also be shut down post-acquisition for strategic purposes (such as double coverage of catchment areas resulting in margin dilution). For example, following the acquisition of 71 “Fortesan” branded stores in 2018/2019 (see “—Recent acquisitions”), Arcaplanet either closed or sold nine of them. Arcaplanet also disposed of the “Fortesan” warehouse in Fossano, Piemonte in June 2020. All Arcaplanet Stores are rented, and the rental costs across the network are broadly consistent period-onperiod in respect of comparable store sizes, within each location category. Pursuant to Italian Law 392/78, lease agreements for the Arcaplanet Stores must have a minimum duration of six years. They automatically renew for additional six-year periods, unless terminated on twelve months’ notice. The majority of these lease agreements are standard across the network with a limited number of semi-variable contracts. In addition, Italian laws require retail stores to hold certain commercial permits and comply with various fire prevention, sanitation and other regulations, as well as have prescribed certificates of fitness for use. Arcaplanet has internal procedures in place to ensure compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. _Recent acquisitions_ Arcaplanet has historically enhanced its retail network via a combination of organic growth and opportunistic acquisitions (see “—History”.) Our strategy is to continue acquiring smaller pet products chains or parts thereof across Italy, as and when opportunities arise. We believe there is still significant room for consolidation in the country’s pet care industry. See “Summary—Our Strategy—Continue expanding our physical stores _network through organic growth and opportunistic acquisitions.”_ Arcaplanet’s most recent acquisitions include: - Zoomarket Group in December 2016 (which contributed ten “Zoomarket” branded stores to the network) at the aggregate cash consideration of €4.4 million; - eleven “Country Shop” branded stores from Country Shop in October 2017, of which six are still open as of the date of this offering memorandum, at the aggregate cash consideration of €3.4 million; - 71 “Fortesan” branded stores from Mondial Pet Distribution in 2018/2019, of which 63 are still open as of the date of this offering memorandum, at the aggregate consideration of €39.0 million; - Zoodom in May 2019 (which contributed 15 “Zoodom”branded stores to the network, of which 13 are still open as of the date of this offering memorandum) at the aggregate cash consideration of €1.3 million; - eleven “Fauna Food” branded stores from Medivet in November 2019 (of which ten are still open as of the date of this offering memorandum) at the aggregate cash consideration of €0.6 million; and - five “La Città degli Animali” branded stores from Croci D. in November 2020 at the aggregate cash consideration of €0.6 million. Following each acquisition, Arcaplanet refurbished newly acquired stores as soon as possible to convert them into Arcaplanet Stores in accordance with the Arcaplanet Store Format.

Exclusive Brands products are supplied by approximately 60 manufacturers. In addition, Arcaplanet has arrangements with approximately 70 third parties for the supply of other national and international branded products. Arcaplanet has two centralized teams (both located at the HQ in Carasco) that oversee the supply of products: - Private Label Team—a team comprised of five full time employees that oversees supply, contracts negotiations, product development and other daily tasks relating to products offered under Exclusive Brands; and - Purchasing and Logistics Team—a team comprised of eight full time employees that is responsible for the supply of products under third-party brands, as well as distribution logistics for products under all brands. The Private Label Team reports directly to the Chief Operating Officer. The Purchasing and Logistics Team reports to the Head of Purchasing. In general, supply agreements for products Arcaplanet offers (i) have a duration of one year, without tacit renewal, (ii) provide for purchases based on orders Arcaplanet issues as needed; and (iii) usually include (x) certain fixed and unconditional discounts and (y) conditional discounts / bonuses depending on turnover targets, marketing coverage (both online and in-store) that Arcaplanet provides for the supplier’s products and the assortment of different product lines sold in-store. _Exclusive Brands_ Pet food for the Exclusive Brands is mainly produced in the European Union, primarily in Italy, although Arcaplanet also procures wet food for its Exclusive Brands from Thailand. Dog and cat treats for the Exclusive Brands are mainly produced by Chinese manufacturers, and cat litters are supplied from all over the world according to the specific origin of the sands used (including Italy, Turkey, China, Canada, Germany and Spain). Arcaplanet’s Exclusive Brands pet accessories are mainly sourced from Italy and China. The supply mix of products offered under such Exclusive Brands is set up intentionally to avoid dependency on any particular supplier. In the year ended December 31, 2020, purchases from only one supplier across all our product categories exceeded 5% of Arcaplanet’s total supplies, reaching 5.8%. ----- Arcaplanet licenses certain IP rights relating to its Exclusive Brands to manufacturers so that they are able to produce, package and supply products under such brands to it (see “—Intellectual Property—Trademarks”). In March 2021, in preparation for the launch of the Tagliamento Facility as part of the Vertical Integration Project (see “—Manufacturing”), Arcaplanet renegotiated eight principal supply agreements for products offered under its Exclusive Brands to ensure the supply thereof for the next two years. Under these amended agreements (i) relevant IP rights are licensed on a non-exclusive basis, (ii) the suppliers are obligated to supply the relevant products to Arcaplanet until mid—to end 2023, although Arcaplanet is not obliged to purchase these products from them, and (iii) suppliers may be subject to significant penalties if they fail to deliver their products in a timely manner. In order to maintain quality control of products offered under the Exclusive Brands, Arcaplanet audits the production facilities of each manufacturer of such Exclusive Brands products at least once a year. Such audits are carried out by a permanent team comprising two qualified veterinarians and an R&D manager. However, under Arcaplanet’s contractual arrangements with these manufacturers, they are ultimately responsible for the quality of the relevant products.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The key benefits of the Vertical Integration Project include increased margins, reduced costs, lower time to bring products to market, an enhanced R&D focus and increased quality control. As part of the Vertical Integration Project, Arcaplanet commenced the construction of the state-of-the-art 34,008 m[2] facility for the production of dry pet food in San Vito al Tagliamento, Friuli-Venezia Giulia (the “Tagliamento Facility”) in July 2021. We currently expect the Tagliamento Facility to begin operations by August 2022 and estimate the overall cost of construction to be approximately €45 million. In accordance with Italian Ministerial Decree of December 9, 2014 (Development contracts: adjustment of rules on state aid), Invitalia, Italy’s National Agency for Inward Investment and Economic Development, provides state support to projects that are expected to significantly advance the country’s economic development. In August and December 2020, Arcaplanet filed two separate applications to Invitalia for state co-funding of, in aggregate, approximately €17 million, or 40%, of the Tagliamento Facility’s then expected total construction costs. As part of the application process, Arcaplanet submitted detailed documentation relating to the proposed construction and expected impact of the Tagliamento Facility on local and national economies. Both applications have been approved. Although there is no definitive schedule for Arcaplanet’s receipt of funds, we expect the first tranche of approximately €9 million to be made available during the course of 2022 and the second tranche of approximately €8 million in 2022 or 2023. In addition, instead of receiving lump sums up front, Arcaplanet is entitled to claim reimbursement of actual costs incurred up to the aggregate approximately €17 million limit. Arcaplanet will be under no obligation to repay any money it receives from Invitalia and no such funding will be subject to any additional conditions other than compliance with the terms of the underlying applications. The Tagliamento Facility will have the following principal features: - Production of higher quality pet food. The facility will have two extruders, one of which will be a thermal twin (one of only two of the same quality available in Europe), which will allow for the production of higher quality products, in line with Arcaplanet’s mission to provide pet owners with the best products for their pets. - Automation. An industry-leading 4.0 design will allow for remote control and 100% product traceability, reducing downtime and increasing cost efficiency while minimizing the degree of human interaction necessary, all of which is expected to result in increased safety and decreased contamination risk. - Highest safety and environmental standards. Safety, security and ESG standards will be in line with best practices in the pet food industry and the Tagliamento Facility is expected to be eligible for six ISO certifications. - Modularity. The facility will be designed to accommodate a set-up of two additional extruders, which can double the capacity for dry pet food production with limited further investment. Arcaplanet has also secured an option to buy adjacent land to set up an additional facility for the production of wet pet food. As at the date of this offering memorandum, Arcaplanet has sought, or is in the process of seeking, all necessary permits and authorizations required to make the Tagliamento Facility operational in accordance with its plan for the Vertical Integration Project. The Tagliamento Facility is expected to employ approximately 70 individuals. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Because Exclusive Brands products have higher margins, Arcaplanet Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased to 17.7% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 from 13.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as the share of its revenue generated by sales of Exclusive Brands products increased. Our Exclusive Brands products can be ----- purchased only at Arcaplanet’s physical stores or via our E-commerce Platform, which drives foot traffic and repeated purchases. Increasing penetration of Exclusive Brands products is facilitated by the extensive Arcaplanet store network and the high awareness of Arcaplanet’s Exclusive Brands and the overall “ARCAPLANET” brand. In the recent years, Arcaplanet has been investing significantly in increasing the awareness of its Exclusive Brands and its overall Brand Awareness. Exclusive Brands cater well to the pet “humanization”and premiumization trends, which are the key drivers of the Italian pet care market’s growth. In addition, Maxi Zoo has a largely complementary exclusive brand offering with a significant margin upside (as it currently offers exclusive brands products in all of the higher margin segments). Following completion of the Transactions, we expect to capture this margin upside through the combination and harmonization of product assortment within the Combined Group.

Upon the Tagliamento Facility’s commencement of operations, which is currently expected by August 2022, we will become the first only-Italian vertically-integrated pet specialist business. Our margins on dry food products are expected to further improve as the result of the internalization of manufacturing costs and economies of scale.

As soon as practicable after the completion of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition, (i) Topco will contribute the Maxi Zoo Shares to Midco and (ii) Midco will contribute such Maxi Zoo Shares to the Issuer. See “—The Transactions—Maxi Zoo _Contribution.”_ (2) On the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, the Investors and certain members of management will directly or indirectly hold all of the share capital of Topco, which will (through its wholly owned subsidiary Midco) hold all of the share capital of the Issuer. See “Principal Shareholders” and “—The Transactions—Arcaplanet Acquisition.” The Issuer will also hold all of the Maxi Zoo Shares. The shareholding percentages presented in the chart above represent the expected shareholding percentages and may be subject to variations. (3) On the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, the Investors will, directly or indirectly, by way of cash equity contributions, provide an aggregate amount of €499.6 million to the Issuer (including funding, if any, from management). In addition, on or after the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, the Investors intend to establish the structure for a management incentive program. ----- (4) The Issuer is offering €550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes will (i) be general senior obligations of the Issuer secured as set forth under “Description of the Notes—Security”; (ii) rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer and other obligations that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Original Revolving Facility; (iii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; (iv) rank effectively senior to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is unsecured to the extent of the value of the Collateral; (v) be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation (including obligations to trade creditors) of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness or obligation; and (vi) be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and obligations to trade creditors. See “—The Offering—Ranking of the Notes.” The Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. Within 150 days from (and excluding) the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date and substantially simultaneously with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Original Revolving Facility, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and customary guarantee limitations, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis; provided that Maxi Zoo will only guarantee the Notes if the Maxi Zoo Contribution occurs on or prior to the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date. See “The Offering—Guarantors,”“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—The Maxi Zoo Acquisition is subject to certain _conditions” and “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by (i) a first-priority security interest in the Issuer’s beneficial_ interest in the Escrow Account and the Escrow Property; and (ii) subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by first-priority security interests in the Issue Date Collateral. Within 30 days and 150 days from (and excluding) the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Original Revolving Facility, the Notes will be secured by the Post Closing Collateral. The Collateral will also secure, on a first-priority basis, the Note Guarantees, once provided. See “The Offering—Collateral.” The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be contractually limited under such Note Guarantee to reflect limitations under applicable Italian law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. Until the completion of the Post Closing Mergers, the Note Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral to be granted by the Target Guarantors will only guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under Tranche B of the Notes. For a description of the relevant limitations, see “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note _Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” As soon as reasonably practicable after the completion_ of the Post Closing Mergers, such Note Guarantees and security interests will be extended to also secure Tranche A of the Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after lenders under the Original Revolving Facility and counterparties to certain hedging agreements and any other indebtedness that may rank pari passu with the Original Revolving Facility have been repaid in full. In addition, any Note Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_ (5) The Issuer was incorporated as a holding company for the purpose of the Arcaplanet Acquisition and the Maxi Zoo Contribution, has no independent business operations, other than those in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions, and has no significant assets, other than the equity interests it holds in its subsidiaries and, as at the Issue Date, the gross proceeds of the Offering credited by the Initial Purchasers onto the Escrow Account pending consummation of the Arcaplanet Acquisition. Prior to the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, the restrictive covenants in the Indenture will apply to the Issuer, but not Arcaplanet. The Issuer will not obtain control of Arcaplanet until the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date and it will not obtain control of Maxi Zoo until the date when the Maxi Zoo Contribution is completed, which is expected to be shortly before, or concurrent with, the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date. (6) In connection with the Transactions, the Issuer, as original borrower, is expected to enter into the Revolving Facility Agreement, which will provide for a committed Original Revolving Facility in an amount of €80.0 million. We currently expect no amounts to be drawn in cash under the Original Revolving Facility on the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date. The Original Revolving Facility will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. Within 150 days from (and excluding) the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and customary guarantee limitations, the Original Revolving Facility is expected to be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis. On the Issue Date, the Original Revolving Facility will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by first-priority security interests in the Issue Date Collateral. Within 30 days and 150 days from (and excluding) the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Original Revolving Facility will be secured by the Post Closing Collateral. (7) On the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to use the proceeds from the Offering and the Cash Equity Contribution to (i) fund the consideration payable in connection with the Arcaplanet Acquisition; (ii) refinance the Existing UniCredit Facilities; and (iii) pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.” (8) The Target was incorporated as a holding company for the purpose of the acquisition of Arcaplanet by Permira from Motion Equity Partners in 2016. The Target has no independent business operations, other than those in connection with its incorporation, and has no significant assets, other than the equity interest it holds in Agrifarma. (9) For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, on an aggregate basis, the Guarantors generated 100% of our pro forma revenue from sales and services and approximately 99% of our Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding synergies and run-rate adjustments). As at June 30, 2021, on an aggregate basis (excluding all intragroup items, investments in subsidiaries and goodwill), the Guarantors accounted for 100% of our pro forma total assets (excluding investments in subsidiaries not consolidated and goodwill). The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to certain limitations. See “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” (10) Within approximately 15 months of the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, we expect to merge the Issuer, the Target and Maxi Zoo into Agrifarma, with Agrifarma being the ultimate surviving entity, all pursuant to Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code. Following the completion of the Post Closing Mergers, Agrifarma will be substituted as the issuer of the Notes.

See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” The Issuer is organized under the laws of Italy and is an Italian tax resident. Therefore payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,”the Issuer will not be required to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes if any withholding or deduction is required by Decree No. 239 or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time) (“Decree No. 461”), except, in the case of Decree No. 239, where the procedures required under Decree No. 239 in order to benefit from an exemption from Italian imposta sostitutiva (substitute tax) have not been complied with solely due to the actions or omissions of the Issuer or its agents. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding _Taxes.”_ ----- Although we believe that, under current law, Italian imposta _sostitutiva (substitute tax) will not be imposed under Decree No. 239_ or Decree No. 461 where a holder of Notes (a) is resident for tax purposes in a country or territory which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy included in the list provided for by 1996 Ministerial Decree, or, as from the tax year in which the Ministerial Decree to be issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, let. c) of Decree No. 239 is effective, included in the list therein provided (the “White List”) and (b) complies with certain documentary and procedural requirements, there is no assurance that this will be the case. Moreover, holders of the Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 after the date hereof, including any change in the white list countries. See “Description of the Notes— _Withholding Taxes.” Prospective purchasers of Notes should consult_ their tax advisors as to the overall tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, including, in particular, the effect of any state, regional or local tax laws of any country or territory. Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction are announced and become effective on or after the issuance of the Notes that would require the Issuer or the Guarantors to pay additional amounts (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Withholding _Taxes”), the Issuer will be entitled to redeem the Notes in whole, but_ not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. Change of Control . . . . . . . . . .** Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if, pro forma for such change of control, a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - create or permit to exist certain liens; - make certain restricted payments; - make certain investments; - impose restrictions on the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Issuer; - transfer or sell certain assets; - merge or consolidate with other entities; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain _Covenants.”_ ----- Certain of these covenants will be suspended in the event that the Notes receive investment grade ratings from the relevant credit rating agencies. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants— _Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.”_ Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale.

For calculation of Arcaplanet Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to Agrifarma EBITDA, see “—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data _of Agrifarma—Other Financial and Operating Information of Agrifarma—Other Financial Information of Agrifarma.” Maxi Zoo_ ----- Adjusted EBITDA is defined as profit for the period, adjusted by the following items: (i) income tax expense, (ii) finance income and expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization and (iv) non-recurring or exceptional items in nature. We believe that these EBITDA-based measures are useful to investors in evaluating Arcaplanet’s, Agrifarma’s or Maxi Zoo’s, as applicable, operating performance and our ability to incur and service indebtedness. These EBITDA-based measures are not measurements of performance or liquidity under Italian GAAP, IFRS, U.S. GAAP, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with Italian GAAP. These EBITDA-based measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of operating results as reported under Italian GAAP. The EBITDA-based measures presented herein may differ from Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Indenture. Because of these limitations, such EBITDA-based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to service our indebtedness. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, the Agrifarma Financial Statements and the Maxi Zoo Financial Statements, as applicable, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and using these Non-GAAP Measures only to supplement evaluation of our performance.

(c) Represents the capitalization of pre-opening costs, which have historically been expensed by Maxi Zoo to align to the accounting policy of Agrifarma whereby such costs are capitalized. (d) Represents (i) the elimination of Fressnapf group’s transfer pricing adjustment, which has historically been recorded within Maxi Zoo Adjusted EBITDA and (ii) the effects of the pricing agreement for the purchase of exclusive label products by Maxi Zoo from Fressnapf as a result of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition. (e) Represents the adjustment for the run-rate effect of new store openings on the basis that there is a three year ramp up period to reach the target run rate store EBITDA. The adjustment assumes that a target run rate store EBITDA (equivalent to that of a comparable store, usually reached after the ramp up period) had been generated from the date of opening. Therefore, the adjustment included the stores opened during the period from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021 and has been calculated as a difference between the full year target run rate store EBITDA and the actual store EBITDA for the period. (f) In connection with the Transactions, the Investors commissioned a third-party due diligence report from a global consulting firm to analyze the financial condition and operations of the Group and its potential for achieving synergies in relation to the Transactions. This report has identified up to €20 million in potential synergies, based on the Target Group’s and Maxi Zoo’s operating models, that may be achievable through the implementation of various transformation measures over a period of ----- two years. This synergetic potential is also supported by other due diligence and detailed cost and synergy assessments undertaken by the Investors in connection with the Transactions, as well as by benchmarking the Group’s profitability against that of its public peer companies. It is also comparable to profitability improvements achieved in other similar transactions in the pet products industry under sponsor ownership. We intend to initiate a Transformation Program to implement these synergies upon completion of the Arcaplanet Acquisition, although we believe that some of these measures can be initiated even prior to the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, because they are a continuation of Arcaplanet’s existing and ongoing efficiency measures. We give effect to these synergies in calculating our Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as if the underlying synergies had been realized on June 30, 2021. We expect to incur one-off costs of approximately €18 million and capital expenditures of approximately €5 million between 2021 and 2023 in connection with these initiatives. The synergetic potential and adjustments set forth in the following table are based on various assumptions and estimates by external consultants and management regarding the future impact of our initiatives. This information is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those assumed in the adjustments below. As a result, while we believe that these adjustments and potential synergies are reasonable estimates, the actual results and synergies in any given period may differ from those estimated herein.

Arcaplanet Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Agrifarma EBITDA, combined with EBITDA of Arcaplanet S.A., Arcawip S.r.l and First One S.r.l.

We believe that these EBITDA-based measures are useful to investors in evaluating Agrifarma’s operating performance and its ability to incur and service indebtedness. These EBITDA-based measures are not measurements of Agrifarma’s performance or liquidity under Italian GAAP, IFRS, U.S. GAAP, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with Italian GAAP. These EBITDA-based measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of Agrifarma’s operating results as reported under Italian GAAP. The EBITDA-based measures presented herein differ from Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Indenture. Because of these limitations, such EBITDA-based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to Agrifarma to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to it to service our indebtedness. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Agrifarma Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and using these Non-GAAP Measures only to supplement evaluation of our performance.

We compete with other pet product retailers and other mass and general retailers (both off-line and online), some of which are larger and have significantly greater resources than we have. We may not be able to sustain our competitive position generally or, more specifically, the attractiveness of our products and services. We have been able to compete by differentiating ourselves from our competitors through providing a careful combination of product assortment, competitive pricing, store locations and formats, e-commerce offering and unique customer experience. If changes in consumer preferences decrease the competitive advantage attributable to these factors, or if we fail to otherwise positively differentiate our customer experience from our competitors, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. We expect increasing competition in the pet products and services industry, in particular Internet-based competition, and increasing online market penetration in the Italian pet market generally. Although we are currently investing in developing our omni-channel capabilities, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. Industry consolidation, including by way of mergers and acquisitions, or new competitors that may enter the Italian pet products market or existing competitors which may expand further into Italy may also lead to increased competition and cause our market position to deteriorate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. Such consolidation could also give our competitors increased negotiating leverage with suppliers and greater marketing resources, allowing them to compete more effectively with us. If we fail to compete successfully and acquire new customers or retain existing customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The revenue we generate is a function of how successfully we sell our products and services which, in turn, is tied to overall levels of consumer and business spending in Italy. General economic conditions affect consumer spending and confidence. Such conditions may change unexpectedly as the result of a large number of factors over which we have no control, including general government policy, monetary and fiscal policy and overall economic climate. A sustained deterioration in economic conditions in Italy may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing customer numbers or spend per customer, among other things. A reduction in consumer spending could result in a decrease of our revenue and profits and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. EU economic activity underwent sharp downturns after the 2007 / 2009 financial crisis and the 2012 Eurozone sovereign financial crisis and recovery has been inconsistent and slower than anticipated, particularly in Italy. During the times of those crises, credit and capital markets across the globe experienced volatility and disruption and business credit and liquidity tightened. These developments have had a negative impact on Italy’s growth and linger in certain areas of the Italian economy, and continued uncertainty could lead to further deterioration of investor and market confidence. We predominantly operate in Italy and therefore are likely to be more affected by economic weakness or uncertainty in Italy than our competitors with international operations. A renewal of these difficult financial and macroeconomic conditions could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. ----- Consumer spending in Italy is generally correlated to macroeconomic and political developments. In the past, macroeconomic and political events have had a negative effect on the country’s growth, and continued uncertainty could lead to deterioration of investor and consumer confidence. Italy’s government is, at present, characterized by general and widespread political uncertainty, with several major events having taken place in the last three years. In the 2018 general election, no party won an outright majority, resulting in a hung parliament and protracted negotiations to form a new government. These negotiations were concluded with the creation of a coalition government, which collapsed in August 2019. In September 2019, a new coalition government was sworn in, composed of the Democratic party and the Five Star Movement. In January 2021, this coalition government subsequently collapsed following a political crisis, and in February 2021, a new unity government of the main political parties was formed, led by Mario Draghi as Prime Minister. The uncertainty regarding the priorities and governing mandate of the new government could have an adverse effect on consumer confidence and sentiment and could therefore have a material adverse effect on the environment in which we operate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612
1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can have a material impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Key aspects of these measures included restrictions on travel and the closure of national borders, as well as the imposition of quarantines, stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, curfews, limitations on building occupancies and other social distancing measures. In Italy, a nationwide lockdown was announced on March 9, 2020, with several other measures introduced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions were eased gradually beginning in May 2020, with bars and restaurants reopening on May 18, 2020 and schools reopening from September 1, 2020. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, the Italian government continued to introduce significant restrictions and social distancing measures. For example, an evening curfew was imposed in Italy during the fall of 2020 and restrictions were imposed on large gatherings, many of the department stores, shopping centers and malls out of which our stores operate have suffered either full closures or restricted opening and closing times, as well as restrictions on the number of customers allowed inside these venues. From November 2020, following a rapid increase in rates of infection, many regions in Italy adopted increasingly onerous restrictions and social distancing measures again. A subsequent lockdown was announced over the Easter weekend in April 2021, with all non-essential movement banned except for intraregional travel to visit family members. As at the date of this offering memorandum, a majority of Italy is in the “white” zone, and a majority of COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted, although face masks are still mandatory in indoor public places, and there is a limit of six non-cohabiting individuals for indoor dining. However, some regions in Italy such as Sicily have recently been moved to the “yellow”zone, where the wearing of masks outdoors and social distancing of at least 1 meter are mandatory. Pet food shops are considered to be essential businesses pursuant to the Italian Ministerial Decree No. 76 of March 22, 2020, and thus our stores were allowed to remain open despite the lockdowns and other government restrictions put in place. See “Business—Arcaplanet—Distribution—Stores.”In addition, because pet products (especially pet food) are generally considered non-discretionary spend for many pet owners, sales through our E-commerce Platform increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and our business has generally demonstrated a high degree of resilience throughout this crisis. See “Summary—Recent developments—COVID-19 _pandemic.” As at the date of this offering memorandum, all our stores in Italy are open, although social_ distancing measures and the wearing of masks indoors is still mandatory. We continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our operations as may be in the best interests of our customers, other stakeholders and the overall business. The opening or closing of our stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic remains subject to applicable nationwide, regional and local guidance and restrictions. Despite our business’ general resilience to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were still negatively affected as a result of the above restrictions, which reduced the number of customers visiting our stores and stores’ opening schedules being restricted, particularly during periods where more stringent restrictions were in place. In particular, as many of our larger stores are located outside of town centers (e.g., in suburban shopping complexes), such restrictions made it more difficult for our customers to visit our stores. As a result, for periods of time we saw lower store sales in many locations. In addition, we had to incur additional costs to introduce extended hygiene measures (such as requirements to provide disinfectants, wear masks and limits on the number of customers in our stores) for the health and safety of our customers and employees. Management estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an approximately €8.0 million and €3.7 million negative impact on Agrifarma’s revenue from sales and services for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. In addition, Agrifarma’s operating expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic are estimated at approximately €1.8 million and €0.2 million for the same periods. ----- Despite an unprecedented global vaccination campaign and other containment efforts, subsequent waves of COVID-19 continue to affect many countries, including Italy, particularly as a result of the emergence of new variants of the disease, such as the “Delta” and “Gamma” variants. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted. These future developments include, but are not limited to the duration, spread, severity and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the possibility and/or impact of additional waves of infections, the timing and ability of vaccinations and other treatments to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers and suppliers, the duration of future declarations of emergency and any remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by the Italian government and the European Union and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We are also unable to predict the extent, implementation and effectiveness of any government-funded benefit programs and stimulus packages on our employment levels, demand for our products and services or other aspects of our business. The COVID-19 pandemic could have further material adverse effects on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition if: - the duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic results in sustained deterioration in the economic environment in Italy; - as a result of continuing and future COVID-19 outbreaks or other deterioration in public health in Italy, the Italian government approves new emergency measures which result in us having to close our stores, restrictions on deliveries of purchases from our E-commerce Platform or disruptions in our supply chains; - continued requirements for social distancing and other policies are implemented to slow the further spread of COVID-19, which impact the operation and appeal of our stores, as customers who dislike wearing face coverings or observing social distancing guidance may choose to shop online or not shop at all; - any customer or employee contracts COVID-19, which could result in a temporary closure of our stores or other facilities for cleaning, staff shortages or customers becoming reluctant to visit our stores; - political, legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are adverse to our business, such as governmental actions or proposed actions limiting retail operations or delivery services, which may prevent us from opening our physical stores or operating our E-commerce Platform or result in material increases in our costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations; - as a result of unemployment or reduced income or increased costs ensuing from the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers respond by decreasing their spending on per products or otherwise changing their long-term behavior; - we are unable to maintain staffing at the levels necessary to operate our business due to the continued spread or increased virulence of COVID-19 or related coronavirus strains or resultant health complications, causing employees to be unable or unwilling to work; - adverse capital and credit market conditions increase our cost of capital or affect our ability to raise capital, and our cash generation is not sufficient to sustain our needs; - tax rates are increased to fund the cost of various government initiatives initiated in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic; or - we suffer cyber-security incidents or data breaches, as more customers choose to shop online, as a result of an increase in the number or severity of cyber-attacks. While we have taken steps to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are uncertainties associated with changes to our operational practices and whether we will be successful in mitigating the targeted risks thereof. If, among other factors, the adverse impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that additional provisions or other liabilities are required to address that, which could have significant adverse effects on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. Any such future provisions or liabilities could be significant. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or any other future pandemic or outbreak adversely affects our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors”section.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

If more pet food or pet supply vendors were to make their products available in supermarkets, warehouse clubs and other mass or general retailers, our business could be harmed. In addition, if the grocery brands currently available to such retailers were to gain market share at the expense of the differentiated brands sold through specialty pet food and pet supply outlets, our business could be harmed. We purchase our pet supplies from a wide variety of vendors located globally. In particular, we purchase our Exclusive Brands products from approximately 60 manufacturers, and we have arrangements with approximately 70 third parties for the supply of other branded products. We can make no assurances that we will be able to find new qualified vendors who meet our standards if our existing vendors cease their relationships with us, or that our current pet supply vendors will be able to accommodate our anticipated needs or comply with new or existing regulatory requirements. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, some of our supplies to experience delays, which could adversely impact our business. If increases in consumer demand outpace our ability to supply products, we may fail to exploit market opportunity, which could harm our business. In addition, we purchase a substantial amount of our Exclusive Brands products from vendors outside of Italy and the European Union (predominantly, from Thailand and China). Effective global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We can make no assurances that our international vendors will be able to satisfy our requirements including, but not limited to, timeliness of delivery, acceptable product quality and accurate packaging and labelling. Any inability of our existing vendors to provide products meeting such requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner could harm our business.

Credit risk in these countries and in other Eurozone countries could have a negative impact on our business. Concerns also remain regarding ----- the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual member states of the European Union. Legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding the stability of the European Union as a single market as a result of the exit of the United Kingdom therefrom may also have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. On June 23, 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum (“Brexit”). On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom tendered its formal notice to withdraw from the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, notifying the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union. Under the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”), the United Kingdom withdrew from membership of the European Union on January 31, 2020 and entered into a transition period which expired on December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the majority of the rights and obligations associated with membership of the European Union continued to apply to the United Kingdom. The new Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”) between the United Kingdom and the European Union came into effect from January 1, 2021, setting out the conditions for tariff-free trading with the European Union. Uncertainty remains around the full effect of Brexit, how the TCA will be implemented and how the trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union will develop. The resulting political and economic uncertainty could also lead to a departure, or heighten the risk of departure, from the Economic and Monetary Union by one or more countries or the abandonment of the euro as a common currency. This heightened uncertainty, and the consequences of a withdrawal, could have a significant negative effect on consumer and market confidence. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more eurozone countries or the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, or the reintroduction of an individual currency in Italy, could have major negative effects on our existing contractual relations with our customers, and could adversely affect the Italian economy. In particular, the departure of Italy from the eurozone would increase our exposure to changes in currency rates. In addition, such departure may lead to the imposition of, inter alia, exchange rate control laws.

The success of our business is dependent, among other factors, on our ability to maintain an attractive online proposition, continue to expand our online and mobile presence, generate e-commerce traffic and convert this traffic into sales. Our e-commerce operations are subject to a number of risks, including reliance on computer hardware, software, services and support and the implementation of new systems and platforms, as well as the risk that our E-commerce Platform may become unstable, unavailable or subject to cyber-attacks or that customer data may be misappropriated. We are also reliant on third parties, such as AZSL, for warehousing and the logistics of collecting orders and preparing orders for delivery. We also face the risk that customers find our E-commerce Platform difficult to use. In addition, customers may be unwilling to share personal information online, less willing to use our websites than we expect, or not confident that such sites are secure. Unexpected costs in connection with the further development of our E-commerce Platform may also arise and we may face difficulties in coordinating our E-commerce Platform and our physical store network, particularly in managing the interface between in-store merchandising and online shopping, which may result in complications for both our e-commerce and traditional stores’customers. We may also be held liable for online content, security breaches and consumer privacy concerns and may be unable to honor our usual delivery terms in case of an unexpected or a higher than expected spike in customer orders or for other reasons which may cause negative reputational consequences.

For example, our online and mobile offerings must keep pace with the technological development of the devices used by our customers, the technological progress of our competitors and any consequential new shopping behaviors and trends. We may fail to adopt and apply new technological advances in a timely manner, or experience difficulties or compatibility issues. We have, and continue to, invest in our omni-channel offering and will rely to a greater extent on increasing omni-channel sales for growth. However, our investments in omni-channel capabilities and technology may not be adequate or effective, and we may fail to grow our omni-channel sales as expected.

We use various information technology (“IT”) systems in all aspects of our operations, based on licenses from third parties. In particular, we rely on IT systems to effectively manage our financial and operational data, process payroll, trade receivables, supply chain, maintain our in-stock positions, process customer transactions and manage our customer relationship. We design and implement cybersecurity policies for our key information systems and take measures intended to prevent security breaches, unauthorized intrusions and computer viruses. However, these capabilities and measures may not be effective, and the failure of our information systems to perform as designed due to failure to manage disasters, security breaches, computer viruses or any other intrusion or interruption of our information systems for a significant period of time could significantly disrupt our business. We continue to invest in our IT systems. Enhancing or replacing our major financial or operational IT systems could result in disruption of normal operating processes and procedures and have a significant impact on our ability to conduct our core business operations. We can make no assurances that enhancing or replacing our IT systems will remain within estimated costs, that the systems will be implemented without material disruption, or that the systems will be as beneficial as predicted. If our predictions or estimates are inaccurate, the results of our operations could be harmed. Disruptions to our IT systems may result from a range of factors, including events beyond our control, such as telecommunication problems, software errors, hardware failures, power outages or damages, user errors, inadequate capacity at IT centers, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or other third parties or other security issues, fire or natural disasters. Any material disruption or slowdown of our IT systems could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed, and functionalities to be interrupted, both of which could disrupt our ability to market, offer and sell our products, as well as our ability to track, record and analyze the sales of our products, which could negatively impact our operations and result in lost sales. In addition, our business could be adversely affected if changes in technology cause our IT systems to become obsolete or outdated or if our IT systems are inadequate to handle our growth.

As part of this initiative, we commenced the construction of the Tagliamento Facility in July 2021. We currently expect the Tagliamento Facility to begin operations by August 2022 and estimate the overall cost of construction to be approximately €45 million. See “Business—Arcaplanet—Product Supplies and _Manufacturing—Manufacturing.” There can be no assurances that the Vertical Integration Project will be_ successful. For example, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in securing all requisite permits and authorizations for the construction of the Tagliamento Facility in a timely fashion or at all, or that the process of applying for these permits or authorizations will not lead to significantly increased costs. In addition, we may be required to invest more than currently budgeted in order to implement our Vertical Integration Project, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits associated therewith in the desired time frame or at all. As we do not have any experience manufacturing our products or operating production facilities, the construction or operation of the Tagliamento Facility may expose us to additional risks, such as risks related to compliance ----- with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and other regulation, as well as result in additional unanticipated costs, which may be significant.

In particular, payments under the operating leases associated with our stores and our distribution facilities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We generally lease our stores for twelve years. As at June 30, 2021, the average residual term of our leases was 7.48 years. However we are usually entitled to terminate such lease arrangements subject to a twelve to 36 months advance notice, which allows us to proactively manage our lease portfolio depending on the performance of individual stores. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including (i) requiring that a substantial portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes, (ii) increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, (iii) limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete and (iv) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing. Any of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors. We depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfil our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund these activities or if we experience working capital leverage deterioration, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us, we may need additional equity or debt financing. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, our ability to run and expand our business or to respond to competitive pressures would be limited and we could be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate planned investments to grow our business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

See “Business—History.” Apart from the Maxi Zoo Acquisition that will add 130 Maxi Zoo Stores, our physical store network grew by 150 stores between December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2021. Our e-commerce channel was launched in 2014, and has grown from 2.4 million users in 2017 to 6.7 million users in 2020. In addition, since July 2021 we have been contracting for the construction of the Tagliamento Facility as part of our Vertical Integration Project, which is currently expected to begin the production of dry pet food by August 2022. We cannot guarantee that opening or acquiring additional physical stores, the further expansion of our E-commerce Platform or the implementation of our Vertical Integration Project will not adversely affect our existing operations. Our operating complexity will continue to increase as we implement our growth strategy and will require a continuous expansion and improvement of our operating capabilities and the training and management of a growing employee base. Developing and refining the appropriate internal management, accounting and bookkeeping processes, organizational compliance and risk monitoring structures required for this growth places high demands on our management, as well as on our operational and financial infrastructure, with no assurance that sales and profitability will increase accordingly. As our operations grow further, we will need to continue to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to deal with the greater scale and complexity of operations. Delays in improving these systems and in reaching an appropriate level of staffing may result in business and administrative oversights and errors, which may also lead to higher operating expenses. In addition, our growth could make it difficult to adequately predict the expenditures we will need to make in the future. This growth could also impact the operational flexibility of the supply chain organization and impair our ability to react promptly to changing customer demands and new market trends. We may not be successful in our growth strategy if we do not make the necessary capital or other expenditures to accommodate our future expansion. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers and to develop and improve our internal controls. Moreover, certain businesses we have acquired or may in the future acquire may have less robust internal controls than the rest of the Combined Group, which might create additional control challenges until the relevant standards can be upgraded to those used by the rest of the Combined Group. ----- We may be unable to accurately anticipate all the demands that our expanding operations will impose on our business, personnel, systems and controls and procedures, and the failure to appropriately address such demands, or the realization of any of the above-mentioned risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

We are subject to Italian Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 (“Decree No. 231/2001”), which is aimed, among others, at preventing direct or indirect acts of corruption, bribery, anti-competitive behavior, money laundering, fraud, environmental crimes, health and safety crimes and any other illegal or otherwise unethical conduct. As of the date of this offering memorandum, not all the Italian subsidiaries of the Target may have adopted the internal control model envisaged by Decree No. 231/2001 (the “231 Model”). Although the adoption of the 231 Model is not compulsory, it may eliminate or in any case reduce the exposure should one of the offences specified in Decree No. 231/2001 be committed by representatives, executives and directors of any of the Target’s Italian subsidiaries or Maxi Zoo. Moreover, pursuant to certain case-law, even though not mandatory, the failure by the directors of a medium/large company to adopt a 231 Model, may be regarded as a violation of their fiduciary duties. Therefore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending against possible proceedings in relation to the administrative liability pursuant to Decree No. 231/2001. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business, including through harm to our reputation. This risk is increased as a result of our frequent acquisitions, as entities that we acquire from to time may not have internal control procedures of an effectiveness equivalent to ours. If we fail to maintain, or fail to cause the companies we acquire to adopt and maintain, adequate internal controls our financial statements may not accurately reflect our financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

This includes the recent acquisitions of (i) 71 “Fortesan”branded stores in 2018/2019 via Agrifarma’s merger with Mondial Pet Distribution, (ii) 15 “Zoodom” branded stores from Zoodom in 2019, (iii) 11 “Fauna Food” branded stores from Medivet in 2019 and (iv) five “La Città degli Animali” branded stores from Croci D. in 2020. See “Business—Arcaplanet—Distribution—Stores—Recent acquisitions.” As part of our growth strategy, we may evaluate opportunities to further acquire complementary businesses (either as companies or a collection of stores) or enter into commercial partnerships to supplement our growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase suitable businesses or assets or partner with suitable co-ventures in the future, or that such acquisitions or partnerships will be successful. Any acquisition, commercial partnership or other strategic transaction we may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expenses and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions or commercial partnerships. Such transactions may also disrupt our relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, the success of any acquisition or commercial partnership depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company, commercial partnership or store chain, which may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention and our financial and other resources. Even if we are able to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or assets, this integration may not result in the realization of the full synergies, cost savings, revenue and cash flow enhancements, operational efficiencies and other benefits that we anticipate. Although we typically conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, commercial partnership or other strategic transaction, there can be no assurance that we will discover all operational deficiencies or material liabilities of an acquired business, commercial partnership or a collection of assets for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. Moreover, our competitors may also follow similar acquisition or commercial partnership strategies and may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept lessfavorable terms than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring the businesses or assets that we target to the benefit of such competitors. Furthermore, acquisitions or commercial partnerships may require the approval of antitrust or other authorities (either at the national or EU-level) or third-party consents, which can block, impose conditions ----- on, or delay the process which could result in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. As a condition of their approval, or after the completion of, any acquisition or commercial partnership, we may be required by relevant antitrust authorities to dispose of certain assets we acquire. Any of these factors may have a material adverse impact on our profitability, and due to our large footprint in Italy, it may be difficult to meet the requirements of antitrust and competition regulation when pursuing acquisition targets. In addition, our debt may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future acquisition or commercial partnership, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall operations.

While we have implemented systems and processes to protect us against these risks, there can be no guarantee that these systems or processes are adequate to safeguard against such theft or misappropriation. Our business involves the storage and transmission of customers’personal information, consumer preferences and credit card information, as well as confidential information about our employees, our suppliers and our own business. For example, we collect and store certain customer data, including personal information and information regarding our customers’preferences and purchasing patterns. While we believe that our customer data protection systems are robust, adequate to support our activities and insured to standards that are comparable to other operators in our industry, our information systems may face cyber-attacks in the future and are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks, as cyber criminals develop new ways to gain unlawful access to protected information systems.

Arcaplanet is subject to a number of collective bargaining agreements that regulate remuneration, minimum salary, salary complements, extra time, benefits, bonuses and partial disability. See “Business—Arcaplanet—Employees; Health and Safety.” Our business is labor intensive, and maintaining good relationships with our employees, trade unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our operations. While we believe that we have good relations with unions and employees generally, there can be no assurance that our relations will not deteriorate and that we will not experience labor disputes in the future. Any failure to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, we could in the future be party to labor disputes with certain of our employees. There can be no assurance that disputes by employees will not have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, ----- financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, from time to time, we have and may in the future, carry out collective dismissals or close stores as part of the optimization of our store footprint. Such collective dismissals or store closures may result in disputes with or claims by trade unions and our employees and we may be required to pay additional amounts to resolve or settle such disputes or claims. Additionally, the right to go on strike is provided for under Italian law.

The need to comply with data protection legislation is a significant controlling, operational and reputational risk, which can affect us in a number of ways including, for example, making it more difficult to maintain and expand our marketing data, commercially utilize available data and also through potential litigation and governmental investigations relating to the alleged misuse of personal data. Regulation regarding data collection and data protection may also become stricter in the future. New laws, regulations or developments in this field and changes in consumer behavior could interfere with our strategies to use privacy-related information for our multi-channel marketing efforts and could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we currently have measures in place to protect our customers’data and to comply with all applicable data protection regulations, significant modifications in laws or regulations, as well as changes in the interpretation and enforcement practices of authorities concerning existing laws and regulations, in Italy and the European Union may consequently lead to us incurring higher costs or having to change our business practices. Compliance may become more complex and involve higher costs, and non-compliance may give rise to civil liability, administrative orders (including injunctive relief), fines or even criminal charges. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) on data privacy introduced substantial changes to the EU and local data protection regimes, involving replacement in EU member states of major parts of the previous national data protection laws by a directly applicable EU regulation. Since the GDPR came into effect on May 25, 2018, it has imposed a substantially higher compliance burden on our business. In addition, the regulation entails higher maximum level of fines than was historically the case for potential compliance failures. Given our increasing focus on omni-channel capabilities, which includes further developing our E-commerce Platform, we will have to adapt to any change in the legal environment with regards to data protection, which could lead to significant implementation costs. There are also several initiatives pending aimed at establishing a single, uniform digital European market such as an e-privacy regulation or the proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. We may also be indirectly affected by European Union court rulings.

This ruling has an impact also on data transfers to any other third country within the meaning of the GDPR that does not provide a level of data protection equivalent to the EU, unless the EU Commission adopted an adequacy decision for that third country outside the EEA. Overall, the European Court of Justice rulings may lead to us incurring higher costs or having to change our business practices in this respect.

Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. We cannot be certain that the Investors’ due diligence investigation has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts (including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating the merits of investing in the Target Group.

These assumptions are based on information made available by the Target Group, which we believe to be reasonable. However, these assumptions and forecasts may prove to be inaccurate, and we may suffer from, among others, a failure to realize the expected benefits of the Arcaplanet Acquisition, higher than expected transaction and integration costs, costs related to unknown liabilities, and a deterioration of our business due to general economic and business conditions. Specifically, our objective to realize cost savings described under “Summary—Strategy” and elsewhere in this offering memorandum may differ materially from our actual results and investors in the Notes should not place undue reliance on this objective. We have not defined, and do not intend to define, “short-term”or “medium term,”and these should not be read as indicating that we are targeting such cost savings for any particular fiscal year. This cost-savings objective is based on a number of assumptions which are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and other risks, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, such assumptions may change or may not materialize at all. In addition, unanticipated events may adversely affect our actual results in future periods whether or not these assumptions otherwise prove to be correct. As a result, our actual cost savings, if any, may vary materially from this objective. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition following the completion of the Arcaplanet Acquisition and could cause our actual results to differ from the assumptions and forecasts set forth in this offering memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Failure to successfully integrate the Maxi Zoo Stores and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may prevent us from achieving some or all of our strategic goals and from realizing the anticipated benefits of ----- the Transactions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. Potential difficulties that we may encounter in the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following: - potential unknown or currently unquantifiable liabilities; - potential unknown and unforeseen expenses and delays associated with the integration of the Maxi Zoo Stores, as well as the possibility that planned integration costs may be materially greater than anticipated; - performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by the integration process; - complexities associated with managing the combined business, including difficulties meeting customer needs and addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies; - significant increases in our operating expenses; and - additional business, financial and operating risks we have yet to identify. There are no assurances that the Maxi Zoo Acquisition will ultimately result in the realization of the anticipated economic benefits and other expected synergies.

The Post Closing Mergers will be undertaken pursuant to the provisions of, among others, the applicable corporate laws of Italy. In order to complete the Post Closing Mergers, there are various steps that we must take, including the filing and/or registration of the relevant merger documents with the competent Companies Registers in Italy. Our estimation of the time frame required to complete the Post Closing Mergers is based upon usual market practice. While we intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Post Closing Mergers, their completion will be subject to certain conditions that depend on actions of third parties and which are out of our control and may not occur within the currently envisaged time frame or at all. In addition, the Post Closing Mergers involving the Issuer and its Italian subsidiaries will be undertaken pursuant to and subject to the conditions of Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code (the “LBO Merger”). Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code is the central provision in the Italian legislation regulating merger and debt push-downs (thus its application constitutes a safe harbor vis-à-vis the risk that any such merger can be considered unlawful, from a financial assistance perspective or otherwise). In order to complete the LBO Merger, there are various steps that the Issuer must take including the preparation of a merger plan, a report by the directors of the companies involved in the LBO Merger, approval by the Issuer’s committee with responsibility for considering and approving certain related party transactions, and a report by an independent expert appointed by the court, assessing the methods used for determining the exchange ratio and the fairness of the ratio, as well as stating the reasonableness of the assessment set out in the merger plan in relation to the financial resources required to support the financial indebtedness of the surviving entity. As the incorporating company or the company resulting from the LBO Merger will be an Italian joint stock company (società per _azioni), the independent expert is required to be appointed by the court, which creates an inherent uncertainty_ as to the length of time in which the LBO Merger can be expected to take place. In addition, there can be no assurance that the independent expert will release its report in a timely manner and/or that the report will approve the reasonableness of the assumptions of the merger plan or that the other steps required for the LBO Merger will be taken in a timely manner, or at all. Subject to certain exceptions, the LBO Merger, if any, can only be implemented following the expiration of 60 days after the latest filing with the competent companies’ registry of the resolutions approving the LBO Merger. Within this 60-day deadline, the creditors of the companies involved in the LBO Merger, if any, are entitled to challenge the LBO Merger. In the event we are unable to complete the Post Closing Mergers, the ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes will depend entirely on the ability of Agrifarma, the borrower under the Proceeds Loan, to make payments to the Issuer under such Proceeds Loan, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including Agrifarma and Maxi Zoo, to, directly or indirectly, make dividends, distributions or advances to the Issuer, and on the ability of the Issuer to borrow from other sources, including under the Original Revolving Facility. However, any repayment, reduction, cancellation, extinguishment or equitization of such Proceeds Loan will reduce the potential value of such claims available at the time of any enforcement on the security interests over such claims. Following the Post Closing Mergers, and to the extent applicable, certain security interests in the Collateral may be released. In addition, subject to and on terms consistent with the Agreed Security Principles, certain other security interests in the Collateral may be confirmed, extended and/or granted (as applicable) in accordance with the covenants described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment _of Security Interest.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company, (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person, or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to ----- any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. Such provision has been repealed and replaced by the new Insolvency Code (as defined herein), the entry into force of which has been currently postponed (with some exceptions) to May 16, 2022. Therefore, following the date of entry into force of the new Insolvency Code, such provision under Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code will cease to apply but a substantially similar provision will be provided in the new Insolvency Code. For a more detailed description of the provisions contained in the new Insolvency Code, see “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations—Italy.”_ The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are incorporated as societa` per azioni. Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, it cannot be excluded that a court may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code in respect of any of the funds made available by the Issuer to any of its subsidiaries under the intercompany loans, including the Proceeds Loan. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under intercompany loan, including the Proceeds Loan, are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any obligations of any Italian subsidiary vis-a-vis the Issuer under any intercompany loan, including the Proceeds Loan, be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any such intercompany loan granted to the relevant Italian subsidiary, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligation of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan, including the Proceeds Loan, is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or any guarantees granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Following consummation of the Arcaplanet Acquisition and the Maxi Zoo Contribution and prior to the completion of the Post Closing Mergers, the Issuer will be dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments (including, under the Proceeds Loan) to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The Issuer’s subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans (or make payments under the Proceeds Loan) to the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes. See “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees _and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “—The Issuer’s right to receive payments under any Proceeds Loan or other shareholders loan may be subordinated by law to the obligations of other creditors.”_ Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debt when due. In this respect, Italian corporate laws require a company to retain at least 5% of its annual unconsolidated net income until such reserve reaches at least 20% of the value of the company’s share capital, and future contractual restrictions, including restrictions in credit facilities and other indebtedness, that may affect the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Issuer. In addition, applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to taxation. ----- The subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees.

In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the Offering. The value of the assets forming part of the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate may include restrictions on the persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of the Issuer’s subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in addition to any applicable legal restrictions (including, without limitation, due to financial assistance and corporate benefit reasons), such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral.

In the event that any Note Guarantee or security interest is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent such limitations on the Note Guarantees or security obligation apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantors or provider of security, including trade payables of such Guarantors or provider of security to the extent of such limitations. Future pledges or guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the provider of security or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the provider of security is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the provider of security is commenced within a legally specified “claw back” period following the grant.

By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including Italy. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including Italy). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable as Italian law does not provide for such a construct. All or part of the pledges and other security interests in jurisdictions utilizing the Parallel Debt construct will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the ----- Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ In Italy, the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interests and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer or any Guarantor enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as applicable, could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer or such Guarantor under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). A longer period may apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which is granted after the Offering, including the Collateral that is granted on or after the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date.

On December 8, 2015, Estonia indicated that it would no longer be a Participating Member State. The Commission’s Proposal is still pending before the Council of the EU and its status is regularly discussed at the European and Financial Affairs Council. Moreover, in the course of 2020, the European Commission brought to the attention of the Council of the EU and the EU Parliament the possibility to propose, by June 2024, the introduction of a reshaped EU FTT as a new EU own resource. The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and, if introduced in its current form, could apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Under the Commission’s Proposal, the EU FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes provided that at least one party to the transaction is established or deemed established in a Participating Member State and that there is a financial institution established or deemed established in a Participating Member State which is party to the transaction, acting either for its own account or for the account of another person, or acting in the name of a party to the transaction. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State. The Commission’s Proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and/or other Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. If the Commission’s Proposal or any similar tax were adopted, transactions in the Notes could be subject to higher costs, and the liquidity of the market for the Notes may be diminished.

The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the bankruptcy receiver must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any clawback action.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing UniCredit Facilities _Agreement.” The Cash Equity Contribution, the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom are collectively_ referred to in this offering memorandum as the “Financing.” In addition, on or prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Revolving Facility Agreement, under which a €80.0 million super senior revolving credit facility (the “Original Revolving Facility”) will be made available to the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries on the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility Agreement will be available for general corporate and working capital purposes. For a more detailed description of the Revolving Facility Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Revolving Facility Agreement.”We currently expect no amounts to be drawn in cash under the_ Original Revolving Facility on the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date. See “Capitalization.” _Escrow Account_ Pending the consummation of the Arcaplanet Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the Offering into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be in the name of, and controlled by, the Escrow Agent, and, on the Issue Date, the Issuer will grant a first-priority security interest in its beneficial interest in the Escrow Account and the Escrow Property in favour of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. See “Summary—The Offering—Collateral.” The release of proceeds of the Offering from the Escrow Account is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Arcaplanet Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event within three business days). See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of _Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” If these conditions are not satisfied on or before the Escrow_ Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price for the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special _Mandatory Redemption.”_ In the event of a special mandatory redemption, Midco will be required to fund the Issuer in such aggregate amounts as are required in order to enable the Issuer to pay any funding shortfall, including Escrow Account fees, negative interest on the Escrow Account balance and costs and accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such special mandatory redemption date (the “Escrow Equity Commitment”), pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter. The holders of the Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the Escrow Equity Commitment, and must rely on the Issuer’s rights to enforcement under the Escrow Equity Commitment. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the _Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account may not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without relying on the Escrow Equity Commitment.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Following the completion of the Post Closing Mergers, Agrifarma will be substituted as the issuer of the Notes. While we intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Post Closing Mergers, their completion will be subject to certain conditions and may not occur within the currently envisaged time frame or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may be unable to complete the Post Closing _Mergers within the anticipated time frame, or at all.” Following the Post Closing Mergers, and to the extent_ ----- applicable, certain security interests in the Collateral may be released.

In recent years, the Italian pet care industry has been undergoing fundamental changes due to the following key trends: (i) pet “humanization”, (ii) premiumization of pet products and services, (iii) increased pet adoptions and (iv) digital integration. - Pet humanization is the increasing tendency of pet owners to treat their pets as family members. Such attitude drives higher expenditures per pet, as owners are willing to spend more on a more diverse range of premium products (such as pet food, medication and accessories), as well as various services, including pet health care. Pet expenditures have become non-discretionary for many households and can be relatively high, compared to other types of expenses (many of which families have proven to be willing to sacrifice not to jeopardize their pet expenditures). In line with the overall “humanization” trend, calorific coverage (defined as the percentage of calorific needs of the country’s pet population satisfied by industrial pet food versus table scraps and cooked food) has been steadily increasing in all major European markets. Although in Italy calorific coverage is currently estimated at approximately 60% (compared to approximately 60-70% in the UK and Germany), it has increased by 5% since 2015. ----- - Premiumization of pet products. With a greater focus on pet welfare, customers are increasingly prepared to spend more on healthy and nutritious pet food to improve pet living conditions. Therefore, in recent years they have been shifting towards more expensive “premium” or “specialist” products at the expense of cheaper mainstream products. In order to respond to that demand for higher quality products, Agrifarma has developed a suit of its own Exclusive Brands, with specific focus on highermargin top-end products. Agrifarma’s revenue from sales of its Exclusive Brands products increased (as a percentage of its revenue from retail sales) from approximately 25% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to approximately 32% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and further to approximately 41% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We followed a similar strategy with regards to the assortment of third party brands offering, which are mainly focused on the premium, super premium and specialist segments. See “—Focus on higher margin premium products and services.” - Increased pet adoptions. Although Italian pet population remained substantially constant in 2010— 2019, pet adoptions in the country increased by 5.3%, year-on-year, in 2020 due to a large increase in the number of people working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic and the expectation that flexible working trends will continue post the ongoing public health crisis. The population of cats and dogs in Italy reached 17 million in 2020, according to a leading international consulting firm. The current significant increase in pet ownership is expected to be a structural driver behind increased volume of the Italian pet care market at least in the medium term. - Digital integration. Pet care has been relatively slow to transition to online sales and is significantly behind other retail categories, such as apparel and electronics. However, younger generations are displaying more interest in business models which can integrate elements of online shipping into traditionally physical retail models. Omni-channel pet care models, such as Agrifarma’s, are becoming much more prevalent, as the COVID-19 pandemic has helped drive penetration of online channels. In response to that trend, Agrifarma has developed a comprehensive online proposition via its E-commerce Platform. See “—Omni-channel proposition with complementary services.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

For example, during the global financial crisis of 2007 / 2009, Italian GDP decreased by 3.7% from 2008 to 2009, whereas, according to a leading international consulting firm, the country’s pet care market grew by 4.9%, by value. Outside Italy, such resilience of the pet care industry has been demonstrated across all major markets, including the UK, Germany, France, Spain and the US. This resilience has been largely attributable to structural changes of consumer behaviour, such as pet “humanization” and premiumization of pet products and services, which have made significant pet expenditure non-discretionary for many Italian households. See “—Changing consumer preferences in the _Italian per care market.”_ In addition, the non-discretionary nature of pet expenditure has been effectively recognized by the Italian government during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pet food shops were declared essential businesses pursuant to the Italian Ministerial Decree No. 76 of March 22, 2020, which allowed Arcaplanet’s stores to remain open despite lockdowns and other government restrictions. In line with such structural resilience of the market and favourable regulation, in the periods under review Agrifarma’s results of operations have not been significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Agrifarma’s revenue from sales and services grew by €33.3 million, or 10.9%, from €305.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €339.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This momentum has continued into 2021, with Agrifarma’s revenue from sales and services growing by €29.8 million, or 18.9%, from €157.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to €187.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Agrifarma’s development of online capabilities to complement its physical stores network has also helped to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as retail sales through the E-commerce Platform grew significantly during the time of this public health crisis.

The availability of the Original Revolving Facility will be subject to certain conditions. Historically, the principal resources of Agrifarma’s liquidity have been its cash flows from operating activities and drawings under the revolving credit facility under the Existing UniCredit Facilities Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing UniCredit Facilities Agreement”. The Existing UniCredit Facilities are expected to be refinanced in full with the proceeds of the Offering on or about the Issue Date. See “Use of Proceeds.” Agrifarma’s liquidity requirements arise mainly from its need to meet debt service requirements and to fund its capital expenditure. Agrifarma’s management believes that its cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of borrowings under the Original Revolving Facility will be sufficient to fund its operating capital expenditures and debt service for at least the next twelve months. Furthermore, Agrifarma’s management believes that its current liability position will be sufficient to meet its needs, subject to a variety of factors, including (i) its future ability to generate cash flows from its operations, (ii) the level of its outstanding indebtedness and prevailing interest rates, which affects its debt service requirements with respect to such indebtedness, (iii) its ability to continue to borrow funds from financial institutions, (iv) its capital expenditure requirements, and (v) general economic, financial, competitive market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond its control, as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in purchases of financial assets, only partially offset by an increase in investments in tangible and intangible fixed assets. A description of the principal components of cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 is set out above. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash flow used in investing activities was mainly related to: (i) investments in financial assets for €26.5 million, mainly related to the Mondial Pet Distribution Transaction; (ii) investments in intangible fixed assets of €8.4 million, primarily related to capitalized incorporation costs ----- and leasehold improvement connected to the opening of 24 new stores and the refurbishment of the Country Shop’s retail chain, acquired in 2017; and (iii) investments in tangible fixed assets of €3.7 million, primarily related to purchases of furniture, fittings, office and department equipment, ordinary and electronic office machines. _Cash flow (used in)/from financing activities 2020 compared with 2019_ Cash flow used in financing activities decreased by €1.4 million, to cash used of €1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from cash generated of €32 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly related to repayments of the first instalments under Capex 1 and Capex 2 facilities of the Existing UniCredit Facilities Agreement for an aggregate amount of €1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. _2019 compared with 2018_ Cash generated from financing activities decreased by €34.0 million, to €32 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly related to a drawdown of additional €35.0 million under Facility B1 of the Existing UniCredit Facilities Agreement in the year ended December 31, 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

S.p.A. (the “Target”), the holding entity of Agrifarma S.p.A. (“Agrifarma”) for a purchase price of €948.9 million (the “Arcaplanet Acquisition”). The Arcaplanet Acquisition will be financed from (i) an estimated equity contribution in the amount of €499.6 million (the “Cash Equity Contribution”) and from (ii) a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering (as described below) in the amount of €449.3 million. The consummation of the Arcaplanet Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including customary antitrust approvals and the performance of certain closing actions. _The Maxi Zoo Contribution_ Also on June 24, 2021, Seventh Cinven Fund (No. 1) Limited Partnership (the “Seventh Cinven Fund”), Shiba Topco Limited, an intermediate holding company of the Issuer (“TopCo”) and Fressnapf Beteiligungs GmbH (“Fressnapf”) entered into the Maxi Zoo Acquisition Agreement whereby Topco will purchase the entire issued share capital of Maxi Zoo Italia S.p.A. (“Maxi Zoo”) from Fressnapf in exchange for an issuance of certain new shares in Topco to Fressnapf, concurrently with the direct or indirect subscription for certain additional new shares in Topco by each of the Seventh Cinven Fund (and/or its permitted assignees) and Fressnapf (the “Maxi Zoo Acquisition”). TopCo’s investment in Maxi Zoo will subsequently be contributed to the Issuer through a series of transactions (the “Maxi Zoo Contribution”). The purchase price for the Maxi Zoo Acquisition is €160.0 million, subject to adjustment based on the net debt or cash position and working capital at the date of closing of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition. The Maxi Zoo Acquisition is expected to complete shortly before, or substantially concurrently with, the Arcaplanet Acquisition. In accordance with the Maxi Zoo Acquisition Agreement, the consummation of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition is subject to certain antitrust approvals and the performance of certain closing actions. As soon as practicable after the completion of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition, (i) Topco will contribute all of its investment in the Maxi Zoo shares to the Issuer through a series of transactions. For the purposes of the preparation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information the contribution of the Maxi Zoo shares to the Issuer has been assumed to be performed at the same value as the Maxi Zoo Acquisition (€160.0 million) with a corresponding entry to shareholders equity. _The Offering_ For the sole purpose of the preparation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, the aggregate principal amount has been assumed to be €550.0 million (the “Offering”) gross of estimated transaction costs of €15.1 million. The proceeds of the Offering will be used: - to fund a portion of the purchase price under the Arcaplanet Purchase Agreement for an aggregate principal amount of €449.3 million; and - to refinance, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, the financial liabilities of Agrifarma under the facilities agreement entered into with certain arrangers named therein and with UniCredit Bank AG, Milan Branch, as agent and security agent (the “Existing UniCredit Facilities”), which are required to be repaid in the event of a change in control and to pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing for an aggregate principal amount of €147.6 million. The Issuer was incorporated on June 21, 2021 to facilitate the Transactions and as at the date of this Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information did not have any revenue generating activities of its own and had not engaged in activities other than those related to its incorporation and in preparation for the Transactions. Neither Noah 2 S.p.A. nor Agrifarma S.p.A. has historically prepared consolidated financial statements. However, on a historical basis, the subsidiaries of Agrifarma S.p.A. were not material to its results and therefore could have been recorded as investments valued at cost. For the purposes of the preparation of this Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, Agrifarma’s interests in its subsidiaries have therefore continued to be recorded as investments valued at cost. Within approximately 15 months of the completion of the Arcaplanet Acquisition, the Issuer, the Target and Maxi Zoo will be merged into Agrifarma ----- S.p.A, with Agrifarma S.p,A, being the ultimate surviving entity. The effects of the merger are not included in this Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information.

In particular, Agrifarma capitalizes such costs whilst Maxi Zoo has historically expensed pre-opening costs. Therefore, this adjustment reflects: - the capitalization of pre-opening costs incurred in the period for an amount of €390 thousand; - the amortization of pre-opening costs capitalized in the balance sheet for an amount of €495 thousand based on a straight-line amortization over the expected useful life of five years; - the related income tax effect on the above-described adjustments determined using the applicable interest rate of 27.9%. It should be noted that the above adjustment has been identified on the basis of a preliminary analysis of the potential accounting policy differences with the Maxi Zoo Financial Statements; hence, following the Maxi Zoo Contribution, the Issuer will conduct a complete analysis, which may highlight further significant differences.

In particular, Agrifarma capitalizes such costs whilst Maxi Zoo has historically expensed pre-opening costs. Therefore, this adjustment reflects: ----- - the capitalization of pre-opening costs incurred in the period for an amount of €291 thousand; - the amortization of pre-opening costs capitalized in the balance sheet for an amount of €282 thousand based on a straight-line amortization over the expected useful life of five years; - the related income tax effect on the above-described adjustments determined using the applicable interest rate of 27.9%. It should be noted that the above adjustment has been identified on the basis of a preliminary analysis of the potential accounting policy differences with the Maxi Zoo Financial Statements; hence, following the Maxi Zoo Contribution, the Issuer will conduct a complete analysis, which may highlight further significant differences. Note F—Modification of supply chain arrangements This column includes the impact deriving from the modification of supply chain arrangements as a result of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition, and in particular the elimination of the impact of the Fressnapf group’s transfer pricing adjustment and the effects of the pricing agreement for the purchase of exclusive label products by Maxi Zoo from Fressnapf pursuant to an agreement entered into between Fressnapf and the Issuer as a result of the Maxi Zoo Acquisition. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 these adjustments lead to a decrease of the cost for raw materials, consumables and goods for an amount of €2,472 thousand and to a negative impact on change in inventories of raw materials, consumables and goods for an amount of €812 thousand, with a negative related tax effect amounting to €463 thousand (determined using the applicable tax rate of 27.9%). Note G—Goodwill amortization This column includes the estimated pro forma effects on the Issuer’s consolidated income statement that may occur from the accounting for the Arcaplanet Acquisition, Maxi Zoo Contribution and related transaction costs. In particular, such effects include the pro forma adjustments to account for the amortization of goodwill recorded on the Arcaplanet Acquisition, Maxi Zoo Contribution and related transaction costs.

1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Italian Pet Care Market Overview,18.1.1,,"According to a leading international consulting firm, the Italian pet care market was worth €3.5 billion in 2020 following years of steady growth. The market can be broadly broken down into two segments, namely “Pet food” and “Pet products”. The “Pet food” segment constitutes approximately 80% of the overall market with a total value of €2.7 billion in 2020. As dogs and cats are the most common household pets, “Dog food” and “Cat food”are the primary pet food products, accounting for €1.3 billion each in total market value of the segment. “Dog food” and “Cat food” products include single portion and multi-portion products of both private label and exclusive brands, including wet food, dry food and treats & mixers. The remaining €0.1 billion of “Other Pet food” is mainly comprised of bird food, fish food and small mammal/reptile foods. Of the €0.7 billion in market value that is accounted for by “Pet products”, “Pet healthcare & dietary supplements” sub-segment constitutes the largest portion at €0.4 billion. “Accessories”, such as toys and pet homes, make up €0.2 billion, with the remaining €0.1 billion represented by “Cat litter” products. This definition of the Italian pet care market excludes veterinary services, which are estimated to be worth approximately €1.5 billion in 2020. The graphics below set out the evolution of the Italian pet care market for the periods indicated: The market is highly resilient with defensive characteristics and grew at a CAGR of 2.5% between 2015 and 2020, primarily driven by price increases due to premiumization and limited inflation. Pet population has remained roughly constant since 2010, except during 2020, in which the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in pet ownership. Expenditures per pet have mainly been driven by overall price increases, however, there has been a slight increase in pet food sales as pet owners shift from feeding their pets table scraps to healthier pet food options (leading to an increase in calorific coverage). Increasing prices are most pronounced in the “Pet products”segment, which experienced a 3-4% price increase between 2015 and 2020. “Dog food”and “Cat food”(the largest sub-segments of the market) each saw a 1-2% increase in prices between 2015 and 2020, according to a leading international consulting firm. In terms of volume, such leading international consulting firm estimates that consumption per pet increased by only 0-0.5% during the same period. The graphics below set out the evolution of spend per pet, pet population and the Italian pet care market for the periods indicated: ----- The main growth drivers of the Italian pet care market are the “Pet product” segment and “Dog food” subsegment within the “Pet food”segment, which are expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8% and 4.8%, respectively, between 2020 and 2025 (historically having grown at a slower CAGR of 4.1% and 3.6%, respectively, between 2015 and 2020). The “Cat food” sub-segment within the “Pet food” segment is expected to grow at a slightly slower CAGR of 4.5% between 2020 and 2025 (historically having grown at an even slower CAGR of 2.5% between 2015 and 2020). The “Other Pet food” sub-segment within the “Pet food” segment is expected to contract at a CAGR of 3.5% between 2020 and 2025 (historically having contracted at a faster CAGR of 4.0% between 2015 and 2020). Across all mentioned categories, (other than the “Other Pet food” sub-segment), growth is projected to accelerate in the coming years. Such projected growth is due to various drivers, including pet “humanization”, premiumization, pet adoptions, increased calorific coverage and digital integration. At €3.5 billion in 2020, the Italian pet care market is smaller and less developed, when compared to other Western European pet care markets, such as Germany and the UK with market values of €5.2 billion and €4.4 billion, respectively, in 2020. As the Italian pet care market develops, certain market characteristics, such as consumer behaviour, are expected to evolve in the future following the trends similar to those experienced in the German and UK markets. For example, total expenditure per pet per year was approximately €200 in Italy in 2020, whereas it was higher at €304 for the UK and at €235 for Germany in the same period (other markets, such as the US and France also have a notably higher spend per pet). The lower spend per pet in the Italian pet care market results from relatively lower per capita income and lower calorific coverage of commercial pet foods, compared to more mature markets due to a higher incidence of feeding table scraps (which may also be driven by both lower income levels and a lower level of pet “humanization”). Another key characteristic of the Italian pet care market is the level of fragmentation between pet specialists, independent (“mom & pop”) stores, modern traders and online players. Over the last 10 years, pet specialists and online players have gained market share mainly at the expense of independent (“mom & pop”) stores. One reason online businesses take market share primarily from such independent (“mom & pop”) stores is that there are large areas of the country in which major pet care chains are not yet present. Online players serve many customers in these areas, taking market share that formerly belonged to pre-existing independent (“mom & pop”) stores. According to a leading international consulting firm, in 2010, the market share split, by value, was 44% for modern traders, 51% for independent (“mom & pop”) stores and 5% for pet specialists, with virtually no online penetration. By 2020, pet specialists grew to represent 17% of the market, while independent (“mom & pop”) stores had declined to a 37% share of the market. Despite the decline, the market share of independent (“mom & pop”) stores in Italy remains significantly above the market shares seen in mature markets, such as Germany and the UK, they had 6% and 8% market shares, by value, respectively, in 2020. The market share of online players, which was negligible in 2010, grew to 6% by 2020 and is forecast to increase to 11% by 2025. However, the projected market share of online players in the Italian market is still below the current online market shares in Germany and the UK, which both had online market ----- shares of 12% in 2020. Given that some physical retailers also have a portion of their sales coming through the online channel, it is important to note the split between overall online sales in the market (including the online portion of sales of pet specialists, independent (“mom & pop”) stores and modern traders) versus the physical channel. In 2020, such combined online sales accounted for approximately 9%, by value, of the overall Italian market, which shows a lower level of penetration than some other major European countries. Online penetration is also generally slower in pet care than in other industries. Customers continue to strongly prefer the in-store shopping experience due to the advice available and in-store services, as well as being able to browse and view products in person. The importance of in-store shopping for pet care products is further evidenced by the growing number of services pet specialists tend to offer in their stores, such as vet grooming and smaller medical procedures. The charts below set out the Italian pet care market breakdown, as compared to Germany and the UK: Importantly, various regions in Italy have substantial whitespace for expansion given the historic dominance by independent (“mom & pop”) stores in these areas. Market developments over the last 10 years present opportunities for further growth for chains, such as Arcaplanet. The Center and South regions of Italy are prime regions for expansion, as they are currently underpenetrated by pet care chains. A leading international consulting firm also projects that the North West and Center regions of Italy will have the highest levels of new store development through 2035. The chart below sets out the penetration of various Italian regions by pet care chains for the periods indicated: -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,612
1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,18.2.1,,"Unlike other sectors, especially in the retail segment, that were negatively impacted by the widespread national lockdowns during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, pet care in Italy was largely considered an essential service and the majority of stores remained open. Heightened levels of home reclusion increased the need for companionship, driving an increase in pet adoptions, which together with the stockpiling effect at the beginning of the year helped accelerate growth in 2020, with the market growing 4.6% year-on-year. Further, demand for pet adoptions exceeded supply and there has been evidence of a backlog that has carried into 2021. The remaining effects of the ongoing pandemic are expected to help drive growth in the near future with the market projected to grow to €4.4 billion by the end of 2025, at a CAGR of 4.9% between 2020 and 2025. The chart below sets out the growth of pet population in Italy for the periods indicated: The resilience of the pet care market has also been well demonstrated across a number of economic cycles with evidence of strong growth throughout the 2007/2009 financial crisis, the 2012 Eurozone sovereign financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Italian pet care market, as well as several other major pet care markets, has shown considerable durability in the times of economic downturn and continued to grow steadily despite contracting GDP. Pet care spending has proven to be essential and non-discretionary. According to a 2020 survey, 86% of pet owners in the United States maintained or increased their spending on pet care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The table below sets out the growth of pet care markets in various countries at the times of contracting GDP during recent economic crises: Within the pet care industry, businesses experienced a range of different impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Some business models have struggled while others have prospered. One of the COVID-19 pandemic’s main effects across economies has been to restrict movement, including movement between and ----- within countries. This, of course, has had a bigger impact on larger players, such as Arcaplanet, which have more sizeable stores located outside of town centers in shopping complexes and away from homes, making it more difficult to travel during lockdown restrictions. Many independent (“mom & pop”) stores, which are located primarily in town centers, have felt less of this impact.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612
1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Key Market Drivers and Growth Areas,18.3.1,,"The expected growth in the Italian pet care market is supported by a number of drivers including: (i) pet “humanization”, (ii) premiumization, (iii) pet adoptions, (iv) increased calorific coverage and (v) digital integration. - Pet humanization. An increase in non-traditional family structures has paved the way for new definitions of parenthood and allowed humans to develop deeper relationships with animals, especially among the younger generations. As a result, there is an increasing trend of “pet parenting” with pet owners treating pets more like family members. The pet “humanization” trend is helping drive higher expenditures per pet as pet owners are willing to spend more on premium food products, medication and health treatments, as well as on a more diverse range of pet products and services. The results of a survey conducted by Morgan Stanley (shown below) highlight the trend towards pet “humanization”, showing that the majority of pet owners see their pets as “an important member of the family”. - Premiumization. With a greater focus on pet welfare, customers are increasingly prepared to spend more on healthy and nutritious pet food to improve pet living conditions. Therefore, customers are shifting towards premium and / or specialist products. Many products are now designed to support a customized diet for pets based on the pet’s age, size, breed, weight and lifestyle. Premium food products that are functional, complete and balanced drive increased spending per pet. Consumers are also focused on increased optionality and food waste reduction, driving a gradual shift from medium format to high €/kg mono-portions. The trend towards premium pet products is more prevalent across younger consumer groups. ----- The tables below illustrate customers’ willingness to spend on pet (by age group) and prevailing purchasing habits: - Pet adoptions. Pet adoptions in Italy increased by 5.3%, year-on-year, in 2020, due to a large increase in the number of people working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic and the expectation that flexible working trends will continue post pandemic. The population of cats and dogs in Italy reached 17 million in 2020, according to a leading international consulting firm. Increased pet ownership resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is a structural driver of volume in the pet care market. ----- The table below sets out the growth of the dogs and cat population in Italy compared to other countries for the periods indicated: - Increased calorific coverage. Calorific coverage is the percentage of calorific needs satisfied by industrial pet food versus table scraps and cooked food. The Italian market is behind other European markets, such as the UK and Germany, where calorific coverage is estimated to be approximately 60-70% versus approximately 60% in Italy, according to analysis performed by a leading international consulting firm. In the South of Italy, there is a higher incidence of calories covered by table scrap, though this is expected to reduce with increased awareness of the benefits of specialist products that offer a balanced diet. The table below sets out the calorific coverage in certain countries in 2019: - Digital integration. Pet care has been relatively slow to transition to online sales and is significantly behind other retail categories, such as apparel and electronics. However, younger generations are displaying more interest in business models which can integrate elements of digital shipping into traditionally physical retail models. Omni-channel pet care models are becoming much more prevalent, as the COVID-19 pandemic has helped drive penetration of online channels, though customers still show a preference for physical touch points and assistance in-store. Companies using a multi-channel approach are best positioned to take advantage of market trends towards digital integration. ----- The graphics below demonstrate the shifting consumer preferences in the periods indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The business primarily operates under the “Fressnapf” brand in Germany, Austria, Switzerland (“DACH”), as well as in Hungary and Luxembourg and under the “Maxi Zoo” brand elsewhere. DACH is the largest region for Fressnapf, generating 72% and Luxembourg of its revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Fressnapf operates both directly-managed and franchised store models with stores in Germany primarily ----- under the franchise model and international stores mostly directly managed. Fressnapf offers both third party brands and exclusive brands with revenues split approximately 50% between those categories. Pets at Home._ Pets at Home is the largest pet care omni-channel retailer in the UK. As at December 31, 2020, it had over 450 stores in the UK and 6.2 million active loyalty club member.

Stores provide a wide range of pet products, as well as pet care services, such as dog grooming, veterinary services, subscription packages and educational workshops and events. The “Vet Group” segment operates the largest branded network of 441 “First Opinion” veterinary practices in the UK, mainly operating under the “Vets4Pets” brand name, of which approximately two thirds are situated in retail stores (the remainder are in standalone locations). The Pets at Home’s model has some similarities to that of Arcaplanet’s, such as geographical presence concentrated in a single market and growing focus on services vs products. However, Arcaplanet does not have direct exposure to the vet channel. Musti._ Musti is the leading Nordic pet care specialist, and operates in Finland (129 stores generating approximately 48% of total revenue), Sweden (125 stores generating approximately 43% of total revenue) and Norway (39 stores generating approximately 9% of total revenue) as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Musti had total revenue of over €280 million and 1.2 million customers as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020. It provides pet food, treats, products, services (such as grooming) and veterinary care, and runs an omni-channel business model with approximately 23% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 coming from the online channel. Approximately 50% of Musti’s products are sold under own or exclusive brands. Both Arcaplanet and Musti sell a similar share of own brand products, but Musti’s business has higher levels of online penetration.

L’isola Dei Tesori operates a mix of directly-operated and franchised stores. Maxi Zoo._ Maxi Zoo is the Italian subsidiary of Fressnapf and is the third largest stationary operator in Italy behind Arcaplanet and L’isola Dei Tesori. Maxi Zoo generated revenue from sales and services of €124.6 million, operating from approximately 120 stores as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Maxi Zoo is primarily a brick and mortar retailer which also provides an online offering.

As at June 30, 2021, Agrifarma had 372 stores. Agrifarma’s in-store services include “Self Wash” (self-service washing machines and dryers for pet clothing and accessories), “Pet Wash” (dedicated self-service facilities for pet grooming with adjacent hair dryer areas), “Agility” (dedicated areas for dog training and entertainment) and “Para-pharmacy” (through which it offers non-prescription veterinary drugs). In addition to its extensive store network, Agrifarma offers its products through a leading proprietary e-commerce platform with 7.3 million active users as at June 30, 2021. Through its stores and e-commerce platform, Agrifarma offers a diverse range of pet food, accessories, and health products under its 18 own Exclusive Brands and under more than 100 third-party brands. It categorizes its Exclusive Brands in the following segments: “Specialist,” “Super Premium,” “Premium” and “Mainstream.” Agrifarma primarily focuses on the first three segments, which have higher margins. The graphics below present Arcaplanet’s assortment of its Exclusive Brands: #### Pet food Pet accessories Health products In addition, Maxi Zoo has a largely complementary exclusive brand offering with a significant margin upside (as it currently offers exclusive brands products in all of the above higher margin segments). Following completion of the Transactions, we expect to capture this margin upside through the combination of store networks and the harmonization of product assortment within the Combined Group. Since our founding in 1995, we have grown both organically and through acquisitions (see “Business— _Arcaplanet—Distribution—Stores—Recent acquisitions”). The Combined Group is expected to have one of_ the largest shares (approximately pro forma 13% for the year ended December 31, 2020) of the €3.5 billion Italian pet care market. We have a large and loyal customer base with approximately 1.5 million Arcaclub® loyalty program members as at June 30, 2021, who generate up to 80% of Arcaplanet’s in-store revenue from retail sales. The “ARCAPLANET” brand enjoys high awareness levels in Italy (91% as of 2021) and we have the highest off-line and online Net Promoter Scores compared to all other competitors in the country. Arcaplanet is currently building a state-of-the-art facility for the manufacturing of dry pet food in San Vito al Tagliamento, Friuli-Venezia Giulia (the “Tagliamento Facility”), which will make us the first vertically integrated only-Italian pet products and services specialist with its own dry pet food production capabilities. Upon commencement of operations, which is currently expected by August 2022, the Tagliamento Facility will ensure full control over the production cycle of dry pet food for our key Exclusive Brands and is expected to significantly enhance product quality, R&D focus and reduce costs.

1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,212,BUSINESS,212.2,Our Competitive Strengths,212.2.1,We are a leading player in one of the most attractive pet care markets in Europe,"We operate in the Italian pet care market, which is one of the most attractive markets in Europe with significant size, consistent growth and resilience and high level of fragmentation. Following the completion of the Transactions, we expected to continue benefiting from these structural factors due to our leading market position (see “—We have an extensive physical network and a solid position in the nascent online segment, _supported by a superior brand recognition, high customer satisfaction and a premium price positioning”)._ According to a leading international consulting firm, the Italian pet care market has been experiencing consistent year-on-year growth at a CAGR of approximately 2-3% for more than a decade, reaching approximately €3.5 billion by the end of 2020. This growth has been driven by what is referred to as pet “humanization,” which is the tendency of owners to consider their pets as family members. Due to such “humanization” and the increasing concerns relating to pets’ health and well-being, owners are willing to pay a premium for high quality products for their pets (the so called “premiumization”). In addition, the Italian pet care market’s growth experienced a strong acceleration in 2020 largely due to increasing pet adoption rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to continue well beyond 2021 leading to a run-rate growth rate of approximately 5% by 2025. The Italian pet care market’s highly resilient, non-discretionary nature has been evident throughout numerous economic downturns, such as the global financial crisis between mid 2007 and early 2009, the Eurozone sovereign financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, during which it continued to grow consistently despite overall GDP contractions. For example, during the global financial crisis, Italian GDP decreased by 3.7% from 2008 to 2009, whereas, according to a leading international consulting firm, the country’s pet care market grew by 4.9%, by value, during the same period. Outside Italy, such resilience of the pet care industry has been demonstrated across all major markets, including the UK, Germany, France, Spain and the US. From a structural perspective, the Italian pet care market still has a very large share of independent (“mom & pop”) stores (particularly when compared to other mature European markets). According to a leading international consulting firm, in 2020, independent (“mom & pop”) stores had an approximately 37% share, by revenue, of the Italian pet care market, compared to approximately 6% in Germany and approximately 8% in the UK. At the same time, specialist retail chains had an approximately 17% share, by revenue, of the Italian pet care market, compared to approximately 44% in Germany and approximately 28% in the UK. Therefore, there is significant room in Italy for specialist retail chains to continue growing in competition with smaller independent players and grocery stores. According to a leading international consulting firm, over the last 5 years, independent (“mom & pop”) stores in Italy lost an approximately 8% market share to specialist retail chains. We expect this trend to continue. In addition, pet care markets have unique and protected distribution dynamics, which are very attractive for large omni-channel specialist players. A critical success factor in distributing pet food is the ability to handle a significant amount of bulky, heavy and relatively low priced (per Kg) SKUs, which can only be achieved via a developed network of physical stores and makes it less appealing for pure online players, given significant related logistical costs. For these reasons, online penetration in the pet care market (even in major countries, such as the UK and Germany where internet penetration for online shopping is particularly high) has been increasing relatively slowly to date at approximately 1 percentage point of market share gain per year. As a result, omni-channel players, which combine physical and online distribution and have large and loyal customer bases, have captured solid positions across all sales channels (including online) in their respective markets. Over the recent years, such specialized omni-channel pet care chains (including Arcaplanet) have built strong e-commerce capabilities and currently offer a multi-channel experience to their customer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The extensive footprint of Arcaplanet’s network allows it to: 1. be in close proximity to customers, showcase its broad product offering and provide best-in-class complementary advice and services. Pet care industry continues to be primarily driven by the physical channel, due to the importance of in-store shopping experience, including complementary advice and services. In addition, certain products (such as lower cost pet foods) come in big and bulky packages, which are more difficult to sell online; 2. benefit from greater relative bargaining power when negotiating with pet food manufacturers; 3. significantly improve its “ARCAPLANET” Brand Awareness; 4. increase the quality and assortment of products and complementary services, providing what we believe to be best-in-class “one-stop-shop”experience to customers with longer opening hours, less queuing and wider assortment. We believe that the Maxi Zoo Acquisition will put the Combined Group in a favorable position to seize the full potential of the addressable market. As at June 30, 2021, pro forma for the Transactions, our network consisted of 512 stores with an established presence in northern Italian regions for both Arcaplanet and Maxi Zoo.

Arcaplanet is the only specialist pet food retailer in the market with a meaningful online presence and was the most searched online Italian pet care market player in 2020. Given the cash flows that are generated by Arcaplanet’s extensive physical store network, we are able to invest in both channels and provide an attractive shop-like online experience and an extensive product offering, compared to pure online players that have historically tended to reduce the number of SKUs. For each of the year ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the E-commerce Platform generated €23.6 million of revenue from retail sales. We expect that the strength of our online offering will allow us to capitalize on the further growth of the Italian online pet care market, which is expected to reach a penetration of 12-16% by 2025 in line with trajectories seen in similar European countries, accelerated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Arcaplanet’s performance in both the physical and the online channels has been driven by its superior brand recognition, high customer satisfaction and premium price positioning. According to a leading international consulting firm, “ARCAPLANET” is among the most recognized specialist pet care brands in Italy with 91% Brand Awareness as of 2021. Arcaplanet has been continuously investing in its overall Brand Awareness, the awareness of its Exclusive Products and other marketing initiatives. Over the last years, Agrifarma’s advertising costs have increased significantly from €6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which we believe is significantly higher than that of any other pet care chain in Italy. In addition, according to a leading international consulting firm, Arcaplanet has demonstrated high levels of customer satisfaction in both the physical and the online channels with a Net Promoter Score of 43 in the offline market (with the next closest competitor having a Net Promoter Score of 37) and Net Promoter Score of 57 in the online market (with the next closest competitor having a Net Promoter Score of 44), all as of 2021.

By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as directed by the Company in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments, as the Company will from time to time direct in writing. The Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account, upon instruction of the Company, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the Escrow Release (as defined below) in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Notes under the Indenture as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed Property. Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in the previous paragraph, the Company will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company) (the “Escrow Release”) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior to March 31, 2022 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Escrow Account will be reduced to zero. In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Arcaplanet Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the “Special",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company no later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent, and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is given by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to",21.14.1,,"the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder of Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes, shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such payments and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Company. Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, Midco will be required to make an equity contribution to the Company to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Property pursuant to a commitment provided by it. The Company from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which in each case must be an Initial Purchaser or one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed an Escrow Release; provided that the Company provides a substantially equivalent security interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; and provided further that use of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Company of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account. If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption. In addition, the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified by Holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612
1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.15,Note Guarantees,21.15.1,General,"The Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. Assuming the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date occurs on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the funds are released from the Escrow Account and the ----- Maxi Zoo Contribution occurs on or prior to the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, each of Noah 2 S.p.A. (the “Target”), Agrifarma S.p.A. (“Agrifarma”) and Maxi Zoo S.p.A. (“Maxi Zoo”, and together with the Target and Agrifarma, the “Guarantors”) will, within 150 days from (and excluding) the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Revolving Facility, accede to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantee the Notes on a senior basis. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide Note Guarantees in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. Certain Guarantors may cease to exist in connection with the Post Closing Mergers. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, on an aggregate basis, the Guarantors generated 100% of our pro forma revenue from sales and services and approximately 99% of our Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding synergies and run-rate adjustments). As at June 30, 2021, on an aggregate basis (excluding all intragroup items, investments in subsidiaries and goodwill), the Guarantors accounted for 100% of our pro forma total assets (excluding investments in subsidiaries not consolidated and goodwill). The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of any applicable law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under “Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. In particular, the obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be contractually limited under such Note Guarantee to reflect limitations under applicable Italian law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral— _Fraudulent conveyance and similar laws may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes and the Collateral” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral——The Issuer is incorporated in Italy, and Italian insolvency laws may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as insolvency laws in other jurisdictions with which they may be familiar.” By virtue of these limitations, a_ Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. In particular, until the completion of the Post Closing Mergers, the Note Guarantees to be granted by the Target and Agrifarma (together, the “Target Guarantors”) will only guarantee the Company’s obligations under Tranche B of the Notes. For a description of the relevant limitations, see “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the _Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” As soon as reasonably_ practicable after the completion of the Post Closing Mergers, such security interest will be extended to also secure Tranche A of the Notes. The Company is a holding company with no business operations other than management of the equity interests it holds in each of its Subsidiaries. Following consummation of the Arcaplanet Acquisition and the Maxi Zoo Contribution and prior to the completion of the Post Closing Mergers, the Company will be dependent upon the cash flow from its operating Subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments (including, under the Proceeds Loan (as defined below)) to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the _Collateral—The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash flows from the operating companies of the Target Group and payments under the Proceeds Loan to be able to make payments on the Notes.”_ A portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company and the Guarantors, including Holders. The ----- Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture.

The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Revolving Facility Agreement and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of Security Interests, the relevant Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under the law in certain of these jurisdictions (including Italy).

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent.

- a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including any factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted under the Indenture), which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

and (y) is not prejudicial to the terms of the relevant pension scheme or other post-employment benefit scheme (or any arrangements relating to such pension scheme or other postemployment benefit scheme or any member of the Group’s relationship with any pensions trustee, agent or regulator (or equivalent or similar person)), in each case as determined by the Company or another relevant member of the Group (in each case, acting in good faith), this paragraph shall not operate to restrict the granting of such guarantee or security; - guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the Company and the Security Agent;

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such other reasonable evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the relevant Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction, in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612
1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.26,Change of Control,21.26.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a Change of Control Offer or (ii) the Company previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph under this section “—Change of Control,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (provided that Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date ----- of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Revolving Facility Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and trigger the change of control offer requirements under other financing arrangements of a Parent Entity. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events, which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may, in certain circumstances, make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Group and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited ----- body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. In addition, if an event constitutes a Change of Control, the definitions of Change of Control and Permitted Holders expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Company in a transaction, which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

If and while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that (a) the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save as contemplated in clause (a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto. If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratiobased basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any Indebtedness to finance the working capital needs of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other debt, which is available to be re-drawn (including under a Revolving Facility or any ancillary facility under the Revolving Facility Agreement) and, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to paragraph (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on _Indebtedness” any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility) shall be_ disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

On the 366th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under this covenant exceeds the greater of (x) €32.7 million and (y) an amount equal to thirty (30) per cent. of LTM EBITDA in a single transaction, the Company will within ten (10) Business Days make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other Senior Secured Indebtedness, to the holders of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to (i) in the case of the Notes, 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and (ii) in the case of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such Senior Secured Indebtedness. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant three hundred and sixty-five (365) days (or such longer period provided above) (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”) with respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”). If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and other Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall prepay, repay ----- or purchase the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination.

Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose permitted by the Indenture.

An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees (but the Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner permitted by the Indenture. The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14-e1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture related to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent amount determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period. The Revolving Facility Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes.

Notwithstanding any other term of the Note Documents, no Permitted Transaction shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in (whether directly or indirectly), a Default or an Event of Default, and each such event, transaction or arrangement shall be expressly permitted under the terms of the Note Documents.

If an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section “Events of Default” occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes, except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents, except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant titled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the period specified in the Indenture. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; ----- (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year.

Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Company, the Trustee and the Security Agent (to the extent applicable).

1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.61,Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream,21.61.1,,"The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor their respective agents take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give any instruction or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give such instruction or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give such instruction or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Prior to the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, the Company will not control the Target Group (as defined below), and none of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined below) will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” In addition, shortly before, or substantially concurrently with, the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, the Maxi Zoo Contribution (as defined below) is expected to be completed. Prior to the completion of the Maxi Zoo Contribution, the Company will not control Maxi Zoo (as defined below), and Maxi Zoo will not be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the _Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, (i) prior to the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date, the Target_ Group, or (ii) prior to the completion of the Maxi Zoo Contribution, Maxi Zoo, will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date and any such non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Arcaplanet Acquisition Closing Date.

Plans that are not subject to the requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may be subject to similar provisions under applicable Similar Laws. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, administrative, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the DOL has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Further, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code may also provide exemptive relief; provided that neither the Issuers nor any of their affiliates has or exercises any discretionary ----- authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the acquisition or holding of the Notes and provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no more, than “adequate compensation” (within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code) in connection with such acquisition and holding. There can be no assurance that any of the PTCEs or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that, if any of the PTCEs or another exemption is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction. Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding the prohibited transaction rules and these exemptions. Under the Plan Asset Regulations, the assets of the Issuers would be treated as Plan Assets of an ERISA Plan if the ERISA Plan acquires an equity interest in the Issuers and none of the exceptions contained in the Plan Asset Regulations is applicable. If the underlying assets of the Issuers are deemed to be Plan Assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of sponsors, fiduciaries and plan administrators of the ERISA Plans, and of parties in interest and disqualified persons (as defined under ERISA and the Code), under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their exposure to liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code (except to the extent (if any) that a favorable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies). An “equity interest” is defined under the Plan Asset Regulations as an interest in an entity other than an instrument which is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantial equity features. Although there is little guidance on the subject and no assurance can be given, at the time of their issuance, the Notes may not be treated as equity interests of the Issuers for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. That determination is based, in part, upon the traditional debt features of the Notes, including the reasonable expectation of purchasers of such Notes that such Notes will be repaid when due, as well as the absence of conversion rights, warrants and other typical equity features. The Notes (and interests therein) should not be acquired or held by any person investing the assets of any Plan, unless such acquisition and holding would not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Decree No. 239 regulates the tax treatment of Interest related to bonds or similar securities to the extent they are, inter alia: - issued by companies resident in Italy for tax purposes whose shares are listed on a regulated market or on a multi-lateral trading platform of EU Member States and of the States party to the EEA Agreement included in the list provided for by 1996 Ministerial Decree, or, as from the tax year in which the Ministerial Decree to be issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, let. c) of Decree No. 239 is effective, included in the list therein provided (the “White List”); or - issued by companies resident in Italy for tax purposes whose shares are not listed, but the bonds and similar securities are traded (negoziati) upon their issuance on a regulated market or on a multilateral trading platform of EU Member States and of the States party to the EEA Agreement included in the White List; or - if not traded on the aforementioned markets or multilateral trading platforms, subscribed and held solely by qualified investors (investitori qualificati) (as defined under Article 100 of the Italian Financial Services Act). The provisions of Decree No. 239 only apply to the Notes issued by the Issuer to the extent that they qualify as bonds or similar securities pursuant to Article 44 of Decree No. 917. Otherwise Notes that do not qualify as bonds or similar securities as per Article 44 of Decree No. 917are characterized for Italian tax purposes as “atypical securities” and as such regulated by Decree No. 512 of September 30, 1983. _Italian resident Noteholders Noteholders Not Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_ Under Decree No 239, where the beneficial owner of the Notes (a “Noteholder”) is an Italian resident and is: (a) an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected; (b) a non-commercial partnership (società semplice) and professional association; (c) a non-commercial private or public institution (other than a company), trusts not carrying out mainly or exclusively commercial activities (other than Italian undertaking for collective investments, SICAVs and SICAFS, each, as described below), the Italian State and public and territorial entities; or (d) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation, then Interest derived from the Notes, and paid during the relevant holding period, is subject to a withholding tax, referred to as “imposta sostitutiva,” levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or obtained upon disposal of the Notes). All the above categories are qualified as “net recipients” (unless the relevant holder of the Notes has opted for the application of the “risparmio gestito” regime (see “—Tax treatment _of capital gains”) or it has included the Notes in a long-term savings account (see “—Long-term Savings Accounts”))._ ----- _Noteholders Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_ In the event that the Italian resident Noteholders described under clauses (a) and (c) above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax and Interest will be included in the relevant income tax return. As a consequence, Interest will be subject to the ordinary income tax and imposta sostitutiva may be deducted from the taxation on income due or be claimed for refund in the relevant tax return. Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a foreign company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest from the Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva. They must, however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and are therefore subject to the Italian corporate tax (“IRES,”levied at the rate of 24% although certain surcharges may apply) and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, the Italian regional tax on productive activities (“IRAP,” generally levied at the base rate of 3.9%, even though regional surcharges may apply). _Long-term Savings Accounts_ Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period) and limitations, Italian resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may be exempt from any income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on Interest if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di _risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraphs 100-114 of Law_ No. 232 of December 11, 2016 (“Law No. 232”) as well as the requirements set forth in Article 1 (211-215) of Law No. 145 of December 30, 2018 (the “Finance Act 2019”), if the long-term saving account is set up with effect from January 1, 2019 and in Article 13-bis of Decree No. 124 of October 26, 2019, as amended and supplemented from time to time (“Decree No. 214”) if the long-term saving account is set up with effect from January 1, 2020. _Real Estate Investment Funds and Real Estate SICAFs_ Payments of Interest deriving from the Notes made to Italian resident real estate collective investment funds and real estate closed ended investment companies (Società di Investimento a Capitale Fisso) (“SICAFs”) established pursuant to Article 37 of the Legislative Decree of January 25, 1994, n. 58, as amended and supplemented, and article 14-bis of Law No. 86 of January 25, 1994, provided that the Notes, together with the coupons relating thereto, are timely deposited directly or indirectly with an Intermediary (as defined below) are subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at the level of the real estate investment fund or real estate SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares. Moreover, in certain circumstances, income realized by the Italian real estate investment funds or real estate SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders or shareholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis. _Funds and SICAV_ Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a non real estate open-ended or closed-ended collective investment fund (a “Fund”) or Società di Investimento a Capitale Variabile (“SICAV”) or a non-real estate SICAF established in Italy and either (i) the Fund or SICAV or non-real estate SICAF or (ii) its manager is subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest accrued during the holding period on the Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the management results of the Fund, SICAV or SICAF. The Fund, the SICAV or the SICAF will not be subject to taxation on such results, but a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will instead be levied on proceeds distributed or received by certain categories of unitholders or shareholders upon redemption or disposal of the units. _Pension Funds_ Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by article 17 of the Legislative Decree of December 5, 2005, n. 252) and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to imposta _sostitutiva, but must intend to be included in the results of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax_ period (which will be subject to a 20% substitute tax). Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period) and limitations, Interest relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the relevant pension fund if the Notes are included in a ----- long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraphs 100 to 114 of Law No. 232, as well as the requirements set forth in Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of Finance Act 2019, if the long-term savings account is set up with effect from January 1, 2019, and in Article 13-bis of Decree No. 214 if the long-term saving account is set up with effect from January 1, 2020. _Enforcement of Imposta Sostitutiva_ Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by Italian resident banks, società di _intermediazione mobiliare (“SIM”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del Risparmio (“SGR”),_ stockbrokers and other entities identified by a decree of the Ministry of Finance or Italian permanent establishment of equivalent foreign entities (each, an “Intermediary”). An Intermediary must: - be resident in Italy, or be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial intermediary, and - intervene, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change in Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited. Where the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by Intermediary paying interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct the suffered imposta sostitutiva from income taxes due. Pursuant to Article 9 of Decree No. 239, certain non-Italian resident entities or companies acting through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Department of Revenue of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (which includes Euroclear and Clearstream) are treated as equivalent to an Intermediary for the purposes of Decree No. 239 if certain conditions are met. _Non-Italian Resident Noteholders_ Where the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident, payments of Interest in respect of the Notes issued by the Issuer will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva at the rate of 26% provided that: - the payments are made to non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes with no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected; and - such beneficial owners are residents, for tax purposes, in a country is listed in the White List; and - all the requirements and procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules, as subsequently amended, in order to benefit from the exemption from imposta sostitutiva are met and complied with in due time. Decree No. 239 also provides for additional exemptions from the imposta sostitutiva for payments of Interest in respect of the Notes made to: - an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; - an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a country which is listed in the White List, and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate self-declaration of being an institutional investor; or - a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State. In order to ensure gross payment (i.e., payment without the application of the 26% imposta sostitutiva), non-Italian resident Noteholders must be the beneficial owners of the payments of Interest (“institutional investors” not subject to tax not required to satisfy the beneficial ownership requirement) and must: - deposit in due time, directly or indirectly, the Notes with a resident bank or a SIM or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or a SIM or with a non-Italian resident entity or ----- company participating in a centralized securities management system which is in contact, via computer, with the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance having appointed an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239 (Euroclear and Clearstream are such a depositary) (i.e., deposit with an Intermediary); and - file with the relevant depository, prior to or concurrently with the deposit of the Notes and in no event later than an Interest payment made in connection with the holding or disposal of the Notes, a statement of the relevant Noteholder (auto-certificazione), which remains valid until withdrawn or revoked, in which the Noteholder declares to be eligible to benefit from the applicable exemption from imposta sostitutiva. This statement, which is not required for international bodies or entities set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy nor in the case of foreign central banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State, must comply with the requirements set forth by the Ministerial Decree of December 12, 2001. Failure of a non-resident Noteholder to timely comply with the procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules will result in the application of imposta sostitutiva on Interest payments to a non-resident Noteholder. Foreign Noteholders without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, who are subject to the imposta sostitutiva might, nevertheless, be eligible for full or partial relief under an applicable tax treaty between Italy and their country of residence, subject to timely filing of required documentation provided by Measure of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency No. 2013/84404 of July 10, 2013.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

In case of payments to non-Italian resident Noteholders, a final withholding tax may be applied at a rate of 26%.

Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss of the same kind, in their annual tax return and pay the substitute tax on such gains of the same kind together with any balance of income tax due for such year.

The depository must account for the substitute tax in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of any capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss. The depository must also pay the substitute tax on capital gains to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio _amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting from a sale or redemption of the Notes may be_ deducted from capital gains subsequently realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth.

A 26% withholding tax will apply in certain circumstances, to distributions by the Italian Fund or non-real estate SICAF or SICAV or received by certain categories of unitholders or shareholders upon redemption or disposal of the units or the shares (as applicable). _Pension Funds_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree of December 5, 2005, n. 252) and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to a 20% substitute tax. Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period) and limitations, capital gains relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraphs 100 to 114 of Law No. 232, as well as the requirements set forth in Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of Finance Act 2019, if the long-term savings account is set up with effect from January 1, 2019, and in Article 13-bis of Decree No. 214, if the long-term saving account is set up with effect from January 1, 2020. _Non-Italian Resident Noteholders_ A 26% final substitute tax on capital gains may be payable in Italy on capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy. However, pursuant to Article 23, let. f), of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets in Italy or abroad are not subject to the substitute tax on capital gains, subject to timely filling of required documentation (in particular, a self-declaration that the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes). Pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 5 of Decree No. 461, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer, even if not traded on regulated markets, are not subject to the substitute tax on capital gains, provided that the beneficial owner is: - resident, for tax purposes, in a State included in the White List and does not have a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected; - an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; - an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a country which is listed in the White List, and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate self-declaration of being an institutional investor; or - a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State. In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must satisfy conditions and procedural requirements similar to those set forth above to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva in accordance with Decree No. 239. If none of the above conditions above is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets may be subject to the substitute tax at the current rate of 26%. However, non-Italian resident Noteholders might benefit from an applicable tax treaty with Italy providing that capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the tax residence country of the recipient, subject to certain conditions to be met. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-Italian residents file in time with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the competent tax authorities of their country of residence. ----- The risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian resident persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary, but non-Italian resident Noteholders retain the right to waive this regime.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and not an adjustment to interest income. For purposes of this discussion, the “spot exchange rate”generally means a rate that reflects a fair market rate of exchange available to the public for currency under a “spot contract” in a free market and involving representative amounts. A “spot contract” is a contract to buy or sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar on or before two business days following the date of the execution of the contract. If such a spot exchange rate cannot be demonstrated, the IRS has the authority to determine the spot exchange rate. The “average rate” for an accrual period (or partial period) is the average of the spot exchange rates for each business day of such period or other average exchange rate for the period reasonably derived and consistently applied by a U.S. Holder. Stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive category income” for purposes of the foreign tax credit. Subject to applicable limitations, a U.S. Holder may claim a deduction or a foreign tax credit only for tax withheld at the appropriate rate. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes. U.S. Holders that comply with certain certification requirements may be exempt from Italian withholding taxes imposed under current law. See “Certain Italian Tax Considerations—Tax Treatment of the _Notes issued by the Issuer—Non-Italian Resident Noteholders.” U.S. Holders that are eligible to the benefits of_ ----- the income tax treaty between the United States and Italy (the “US-Italy Treaty”) generally will be subject to Italian withholding tax at a rate not in excess of 10%.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Securities in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Securities in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Securities in the EEA to retail investors, defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. ----- Solely for the purposes of each EEA manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. Each Initial Purchaser has further represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Securities in the United Kingdom to retail investors, defined as a person who is on (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of of UK MiFIR. Any distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules (for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”) subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Securities is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Securities and determining the appropriate distribution channels. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representations or warranties as to a distributor’s compliance with the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Securities or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Securities in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Securities may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Securities may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer _Restrictions.”_ The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Securities. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and to admit to trading on the Euro MTF Market] in accordance with the rules and regulations of that exchange. We cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by applicable law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the _Note Guarantees and Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be ten business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree ----- otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next seven succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_ The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are currently providing and may provide in the future, investment banking, consultancy, financial advisory, commercial banking and cash management services to the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may be lenders, managers and/or agents under the Original Revolving Facility. The Initial Purchasers have also committed to provide bridge financing in connection with the financing of the Arcaplanet Acquisition in the event the Offering is not consummated. In connection with these financings, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received and will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the Issuer’s securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

(5) It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is, in the case of the Notes offered within the Unites States in reliance on Rule 144A (the “Rule 144A Notes”), one year after the later of the original issue date of such Notes, the original issue date of any additional Notes and the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) or, in the case of the Notes offered outside of the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S (the “Regulation S Notes”), 40 days after the later of the original issue date of such Notes (or, if later, the issue date of any additional Notes) and the last date on which such Notes were first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S), only (i) to the Issuer or a Guarantor; (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A; (iv) to persons who are not U.S. persons pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S; or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) above to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Transfer Agent.

COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time, but is determined for the purposes of decided which court has competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition: moreover, the determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1), second sentence, of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” Under Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation there is, in most cases, a rebuttable presumption that a corporate debtor has its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. The presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the centre of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that Member State have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Recast Insolvency Regulation and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the Recast Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark). If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings that are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or ----- territorial insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings usually become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets). In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer. It remains to be seen what impact the recent vote by the United Kingdom to leave the EU will have on the regulatory environment in the EU and the United Kingdom, and on the applicability of EU law in the United Kingdom. In a “no-deal Brexit”scenario in particular, it may be harder for English office holders and English restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and to effectively deal with assets located in those other Member States. Much depends upon the private international rules in the particular Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular, in cases where the appointment of an English office holder has been made in reliance on an English domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant Member State.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any, and applies equally to downstream, cross-stream and up-stream guarantees granted by Italian companies. The concept of “corporate benefit” is not expressly defined under Italian law and it is assessed and determined on a case by case basis, further its existence is purely a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. As a result, civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. However, no liability can be attributed where no prejudice or actual damage is suffered by the Italian grantor because of the determination of the controlling shareholder as provided under Article 2497 of the Italian civil code (codice civile), enacted by Royal Decree No. 262 of March 16, 1942, as subsequently amended and supplemented (the “Italian Civil Code”) having regard to the overall result of the controlling activity. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. As to corporate authorizations prospective, the granting of a guarantee or a security by an Italian company in favor of third parties or other corporations belonging to the same group of companies of the Italian grantor must be permitted by the by laws (statuto) of the Italian grantor. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral.

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quota holder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower (noting that such provision has been repealed and replaced by the new Insolvency Code, the entry into force of which has been currently postponed (with some exceptions) to May 16, 2022). The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per _azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any ----- Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or claw back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect period. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian _Insolvency Laws Considerations—Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)” below. If challenged successfully, the_ guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the ----- fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/ attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data _certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document_ has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, inter alia, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date) may not be enforceable; ----- - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/ shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit.

However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. In order to grant protection against clawback actions and potential civil and criminal responsibilities, out of court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law must be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial situation of the company. Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring the restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor and the rebalancing of its financial position and, in case of its failure and subsequent challenge before an Italian court, it must not be deemed as unreasonable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

An independent expert directly appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of ----- approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The DRA must be published in the companies’ register to become effective in respect of third parties and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to preexisting debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Italian Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi _di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._ Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and non-adhering) have been informed about the negotiations and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the nonparticipating financial creditors, provided that (i) they have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate in such negotiations in good faith, and (ii) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries have legal status and economic interests similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from block restructuring operations involving more exposed bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may challenge it within 30 days of receipt of the application. ----- In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided for under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors, inter alia, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the granting of new facilities. Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors (e.g., trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court- supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182- bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. All the acts, payments and guarantees over assets of the distressed company executed and/or performed according to a validated (omologato) DRA are exempt from clawback actions (revocatoria fallimentare) in the event of subsequent bankruptcy. The exemptions from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 216, paragraph 3 (preferential _bankruptcy), and 217 (simple bankruptcy) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply in relation to acts and payments_ made in accordance with the validated DRA and/or in relation to financings provided under Article 182_quinquies upon judicial authorization (in respect of concordato preventivo, see below). Such exemption would not apply in relation to the financings obtained “in view” of a DRA (i.e. in order to file the DRA—so-called “finanza ponte”), provided under Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register and communicated to the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato _preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned_ period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato _preventivo (so called concordato in bianco)._ The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the ----- application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed— the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the clawback action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super-seniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato _preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition._ The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The Composition with Creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the ----- _concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the_ majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato _preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result_ of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti _chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio),_ or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. Pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti _preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_ application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition. If the creditors’meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. _Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the_ companies’ register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors, guarantors of the debtor and other joint and severally liable debtors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

It results in the company’s dissolution. ----- A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore _fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth_ the relevant timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy’s estate (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The ----- petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. Once approved, the concordato fallimentare is binding against all non-accepting creditors (cram down). - Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: - for payments of claims with super-priority” (crediti prededucibili). In general, claims are considered to have super-priority when they are so qualified by a specific provision of law or when they arise as part of the bankruptcy (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceedings, such as costs related to the procedure); These claims are paid for the entire amount and before other claims (secured, preferred, unsecured and subordinated). Examples of these claims are bankruptcy receiver’s fees and costs; the costs of the sale of the assets; the rent for the debtor’s offices after adjudication; employees’ salaries and social security payments relating to the period after adjudication; attorney’s and other advisors’ fees. Such claims are satisfied in full (including costs and interests) with the proceeds of the liquidation of movable and immovable debtor’s assets, according to their rank (preferred, secured, unsecured), with the exclusion of the proceeds of the sale of assets subject to other creditors’ security interests (mortgages and pledges), which are directed to payment of secured creditors; - for payments of claims that benefit from preferential treatment (crediti privilegiati in senso ampio or _crediti prelatizi), which include creditors who hold a security interest (creditori ipotecari o pignoratizi)_ and creditors who have a preference under law (creditori privilegiati in senso stretto), such as the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators and claims for employee wages. As a general principle, creditors holding a security interest are satisfied from the relevant assets to the exclusion of all other creditors, including secured creditors having a lower rank (e.g., first mortgage over second mortgage). However, the Italian Civil Code contains very detailed rules (Article 2745) regulating priority conflicts between secured and preferred creditors. A mortgagee and a pledgee are entitled to satisfy their claims from the proceeds of the sale of the encumbered assets. Any excess is available for distribution to other creditors (i.e., second mortgages, preferred creditors and unsecured creditors). Where the relevant asset is insufficient to satisfy its claim against the debtor, a creditor will rank as an unsecured creditor for the remainder; - for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims (crediti chirografari). Unsecured creditors have no preference or security and will therefore be paid only if and to the extent any proceeds of the estate remain after all other claims with a higher rank have been satisfied. Unsecured creditors rank pari passu among themselves in the estate, in proportion to the size of their claims; and - for the payment of subordinated creditors’ claims (creditori postergati e subordinati). Subordinated creditors have no preference or security and are subordinated by law or contractual provisions. They shall be paid only if and when all the creditors’ unsubordinated claims have been paid in full. - Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back”or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the clawback period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes ----- part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. - Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver / court commissioner. - The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: - onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; - payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time when the new security was granted; and - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time when the new security was granted. - The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: - payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and - granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. - The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: - payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; - a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; - the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; - transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; - a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato _preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_ - remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and - payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. ----- -In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. The Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra group transactions. Under Article 290 the limitation period for initiating intra group clawback actions (referring to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to five years from the filing for bankruptcy declaration. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Prodi-bis Procedure, which is regulated by Legislative Decree No. 270 of 8 July 1999 (“Prodi-bis Decree”), replaces the previous special administration for large companies in a state of crisis (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi Imprese in _crisi), introduced by Law No. 95 of 3 April 1979._ The relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last fiscal year. Any of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to Extraordinary Administration. The procedure is divided into two main phases: a “judicial phase” and an “administrative phase.” (a) Judicial phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints a judicial receiver (or up to three) (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within ten days from such filing, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development may make an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. (b) Administrative phase. Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner(s) is appointed by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as a going-concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., debt for equity swap, issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the company have been transferred). The plan must be approved by the Ministry of Economic Development within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the ----- extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The declaration of the state of insolvency produces certain immediate effects, such as the automatic stay of all legal actions by creditors against the debtor’s assets and the freezing of the accrual of interest. The effects of the admission to the Prodi-bis Procedure (Administrative Phase) are that the stay of actions continues and clawback actions become possible. Debts incurred in the continuation of the business generally will have super-priority over any other secured and unsecured claim (prededuzione) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The unsecured creditors are exclusively represented by one or two members of the surveillance committee, which has consulting duties. Creditors can file their proofs of claim and have a right to the distribution of proceeds. Creditors can also oppose the declaration of the state of insolvency as well as the admission to the second phase. Under Article 53 of Prodi-bis Decree, the rules established by the Italian Bankruptcy Law regarding the creditors’ proofs of claim also apply to the Prodi-bis Procedure. The Prodi-bis Procedure can at any time be converted into bankruptcy upon request by the extraordinary commissioner, or even ex officio, if the procedure cannot be positively continued. At the end of the procedure, upon request of the extraordinary commissioner or even ex officio, the bankruptcy court will declare the conversion of the procedure into bankruptcy when either the sale of the assets has been not performed within the term stipulated in the program, or the business has not recovered its ability to regularly perform its obligations. Bankruptcy rules concerning criminal bankruptcy law and bankruptcy clawback law applies to the Prodi-bis Procedure. The clawback “avoidance period” is extended up to three to five years for intragroup transactions. The intragroup clawback action (revocatoria intragruppo) governed by Article 91 of Prodi-bis Decree refers to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group if carried out during the period between the execution of the relevant transaction and the date of insolvency declaration (the “suspect period”) preceding the insolvency declaration as follows: (i) _five years, with respect to: - transactions at an undervalue (transactions are deemed to be at undervalue when the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by 25% or more the value of the consideration received by the debtor); - transaction extinguishing of financial debts which have fallen due and are outstanding, involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind; settlement agreements, etc.); - pledges, anthicresis rights and voluntary mortgages granted or set up for pre-existing debts which had not yet fallen due; unless the creditor proves that it was not aware of the state of insolvency of the debtor; (ii) three years, with respect to securities (pledges, anthicresis rights and judicial or voluntary mortgages) created as collateral for debts which had fallen due, unless the creditor proves his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the debtor in order to rebut any claw-back action; and (iii) three years, with respect to payment of due and outstanding debts, transactions for consideration and those granting a preferential right for debts (including third party’s debt) simultaneously created, provided that the extraordinary commissioner proves that the other party was aware of the state of insolvency of the debtor. The extraordinary commissioner is only entitled to initiate the intragroup claw-back action after the approval of the execution of the liquidation program (unless the Prodi-bis Procedure is converted into fallimento) and without the need of the authorization of the supervisory authority (i.e., Ministry of Economic Development).",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis Procedure and is aimed at saving and turning around large insolvent companies in order to preserve their value. For example, although ----- a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry of Economic Development is made together with the filing to the court for the declaration of the insolvency of the debtor. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies that, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision of whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry of Economic Development following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. This procedure restructures the company’s debts and sells those assets that are not strategic or do not form part of the company’s core business. The debtor must apply to the Minister of Economic Development for immediate admission to the procedure, while at the same time filing a petition with the bankruptcy court in order to confirm its insolvency status. It is the Minister, rather than the bankruptcy court, that has primary responsibility for supervising the procedure; the bankruptcy court is requested only to confirm the company’s insolvency status and verify the lawfulness of the proceeding with respect to the verification of claims. If the debtor is admitted to the procedure, other insolvent companies in the same corporate group may also participate, even if they do not satisfy the relevant requirements. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry of Economic Development so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry of Economic Development, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. The Recovery Plan can provide for the satisfaction of creditors’claims through a composition, which must specify any conditions of its implementation and describe any offered guarantees. The extraordinary commissioner may bring clawback actions for the benefit of creditors during the implementation of a recovery plan. Bankruptcy rules concerning criminal bankruptcy law and bankruptcy clawback law applies to Marzano procedure. The clawback “avoidance period” is extended up to three to five years for intragroup transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario _liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company by the relevant governmental authority (e.g., Bank of Italy,_ Ministry of the Economic Development). The debtor, the directors of an insolvent company, or one or more creditor(s) may apply to the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court must seek the advice of the government agency responsible for supervising the debtor’s business. The judge may initiate proceedings by declaring the debtor insolvent. All legal actions by creditors against the debtor are then stayed, with the exception of those aiming to ascertain the amount of any claim. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. Unlike other procedures, there is no delegated judge, as the procedure is mainly administrative in nature. The liquidator must review claims and consider whether a composition is feasible. If so, he will prepare with the debtor a plan of repayment, to be submitted to the creditors. ----- The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to extraordinary administration proceedings. If a composition does not appear feasible, arrangements are made for the disposal of the debtor’s assets and the distribution of proceeds among the creditors in the same order of priority as in bankruptcy.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The relevant claims shall take precedence over the other creditors’ claims in case of bankruptcy (crediti prededucibili). The debtor must specify the purpose of the requested finance and declare that it is urgently needed and that the inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The Court shall decide on this request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during the suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Note Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the security documents by a guarantor and/or security ----- provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant security documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency.

In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned companies are involved. Recently a comprehensive reform of the Italian insolvency laws and regulation of overindebtedness crises has been introduced (“2019 Reform”), insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (so called “Code of Business Crisis and _Insolvency,”hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale_ on February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl. Ordinario no. 6. The main purpose of the 2019 Reform was to (i) ensure the rationality of the provisions on insolvency, affected over the years by various amendments (especially in the civil sector) which caused a great degree of legal uncertainty, (ii) allow early awareness of the financial distress of a business and (iii) safeguard the business’ entrepreneurial potential during a crisis. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; ----- (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the 2019 Reform. Therefore, the practical consequences of its implementation and its potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. All types of debtors, with the exception of the State and public entities, will be subject to the procedures set out therein. Indeed, the Insolvency Code shall apply both to individuals (consumers, professionals and entrepreneurs) and to legal persons (including non-profit companies, organizations and groups of companies). On February 14, 2019, the Insolvency Code has been published in the official journal. Except for minor changes to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code (and certain express repeals in the criminal sector) which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, according to Article 389 of the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019, the Insolvency Code will enter into force 18 months following its publication in Italy’s official journal (i.e., August 15, 2020). Nevertheless, in the context of the emergency legislation adopted by the Italian Government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been currently postponed to May 16, 2022 and, only with respect to the II Title (Titolo II), to December 31, 2023, pursuant to Article 1 of the Law Decree No. 118 of August 24, 2021 (which introduced a negotiated composition proceeding (composizione negoziata) and a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors for the sale of the debtor’s assets (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio), effective as of November 15, 2021, and certain amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law,_ effective as of August 25, 2021). Until the entry into force of the Insolvency Code, insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as currently in force. The practical consequences of the implementation of the 2019 Reform and its potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth in the Insolvency Code. Leaving aside the 2019 Reform, the Italian Bankruptcy Law saw many reforms in the near past. In particular, material innovations regarding composition with creditors and debt restructuring agreements under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and out of court restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law were introduced by Law Decree No. 83 of June 22, 2012, as converted by Law No. 134 of August 3, 2012 (the “Development Decree”). The purpose of this reform was to boost the restructuring and reorganization of distressed enterprises in order to cope better with the current financial crisis. To achieve this purpose, the Development Decree has focused mainly on three factors: flexibility of the process, reliability of the restructuring plan and tax appeal. Amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law were also introduced with regard to the composition with creditors by Decree No. 69 of June 21, 2013, which sets out urgent measures aimed at boosting the country’s economy and includes some important changes to the rules regarding the application introduced by the Development Decree. The most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree”). The Decree entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, entered into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta _Ufficiale) and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of_ May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi_bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure (as described below), to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. ----- In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy tools are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.1,,215.1.1,,"_The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Italy. The documents relating to the Collateral will be governed by the laws of Italy and any jurisdiction where the Collateral is located. The Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by the laws of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States. Because substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and its and their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer, a Guarantor or any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issue rand the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on the Issuer, any Guarantor or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions (including Italy) upon those persons or the Issuer provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for Italy, where the Issuer and the Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in Italy or elsewhere outside the United States._ Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgments obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato), among others, the following conditions are met: - the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law principles of jurisdiction; - the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been violated; - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of defendant party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law; - the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law; - there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court; - there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which commenced prior to the action in the United States; and - the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico). In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by a U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set out above. In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. If an original action is brought before an Italian court, the Italian court may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory provisions of Italian law. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Moreover, the Company did not make any revaluations under specific laws. The preparation of the Unaudited Interim Condensed Financial Statements requires management to make estimates that affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures. Actual results may differ. Estimates are revised regularly and the effect of any changes, if not due to errors, are recognized in the profit and loss account when the estimates are changed, if they affect just one period, and also in the following periods, if they affect both the current and subsequent periods. Amounts are expressed in Euro. The decreases in intangible fixed assets are mainly due to the normal amortization process, with particular regard to the amortization of the post-merger goodwill of Noah3, the amortization of the ARCAPLANET brand and the amortization of post-merger goodwill of Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A..

Legal reserve: The legal reserve amounts to Euro 224,273 and, due to the capital increase carried out during the year, has not yet reached the limit envisaged by art. 2430 of the Italian Civil Code. Merger surplus reserve The merger surplus reserve, amounting to Euro 226,776,765, was generated on December 1, 2016 from the increase in shareholders’ equity that Agrifarma had following the legal effectiveness of the reverse merger with which it incorporated Noah 3 S.p.A., Saluki S.p.A. and Angelica S.r.l. In accordance with OIC 19, paragraph 23, an entity classifies a financial liability as current / non current taking into consideration the contractual events occurred by the date of the Interim Condensed Financial Statements, which may determine a change in the original maturity of the borrowings. The Company has classified the financial liability as current mainly based on the following: — the loan agreement provides that the lending bank could request an early repayment of the loan upon the occurrence of a change of control; — on 24 June 2021 the ultimate parent company of Agrifarma entered into a shareholder purchase agreement to sell the entire issued share capital of Noah 2 SpA, parent company of Agrifarma. The closing of this transaction, which is mainly subject to certain antitrust approvals, is expected to be incurred by the end of 2021 / beginning of 2022; — the antitrust approval of the transaction is not an event under the control of the Company. Since Agrifarma does not have the unconditional right to defer its settlement of the financial liability for at least 12 months after the end of interim period, the Company classified the financial liability as current. The impact in profit and loss of amortized cost at the period end is equal to Euro 1,453,681. Advances: Payables for advances amounted to Euro 93,462 and mainly relate to advances paid by customers. Payables to suppliers: Trade payables, which amount to a total of Euro 64,548,029, includes payables for invoices received, net of credit notes to be received and payables for invoices to be received.

Captions have been recognised and presented taking into account the substance of the transaction or contract, where compatible with the provisions of the Italian Civil Code and the OIC accounting standards. The company has also complied with the principles of measurement consistency, materiality and comparability of information. As a result: The company measures the individual assets and liabilities separately, in order to avoid offsetting profits on certain items against losses on other items. Specifically, the company recognises profits only if realised before the reporting date, whereas it considers risks and losses on an accruals basis, even when they become known after the reporting date . The company recognises income and expense pertaining to the year regardless of when it is collected or paid. They are, therefore, recognised in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis in order to be included in the net profit or loss for the year. The directors carried out a forward-looking assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future, i.e., for at least twelve months from the reporting date. The assessment carried out did not identify any significant uncertainties in this respect. The identification of rights, obligations and conditions was based on the contractual terms of transactions and the comparison of these with the provisions of the accounting standards to ascertain the correctness of the recognition or derecognition of assets and liabilities and profit and loss account items. ----- The valuation criteria have not been changed since the previous period in order to compare the Company’s financial statements over time. During the period, there were no exceptional cases requiring derogation from the valuation criteria pursuant to Article 2423, paragraph 5, of the Italian Civil Code due to incompatibility with a true and fair view of the company’s financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, no assets were adjusted pursuant to special laws during the period. The relevance of the individual elements comprising the financial statement items was assessed within the overall context of the condensed interim financial statements. In order to quantify relevance, both qualitative and quantitative elements have been accounted for. In application of the principle of relevance pursuant to Article 2423, paragraph 4, of the Italian Civil Code, comments on the items in the condensed interim financial statements have been omitted from the notes, including if specifically required under Article 2427 of the Italian Civil Code or other provisions, in cases where both the amount of such items and the related information are irrelevant for the purposes of providing a true and fair view of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

The purchase cost also includes ancillary costs. The production cost includes all directly attributable costs and other costs, to the extent reasonably attributable, relating to the production period until the moment from which the asset can be used. Multi-year expenses, which include establishment and expansion costs and start-up costs are recognised with the consent of the Board of Statutory Auditors when it can be demonstrated that they have a future useful life, there is an objective correlation with the relevant future benefits the Company will enjoy, and it is reasonably certain that they can be recovered. Intangible fixed assets, consisting of intellectual property rights and licences, are recognised as assets only if individually identifiable, if the Company acquires the right to benefit from the future economic benefits deriving from the asset and may limit third-party access to such benefits, and if their cost can be estimated with sufficient reliability. Goodwill is recognised in assets with the consent of the Board of Statutory Auditors only if it is acquired for consideration, has a quantifiable value, consists of expenses and costs with utility deferred over time that therefore ensure future economic benefits, and the principle of the recoverability of the related cost is satisfied. ----- Leasehold improvements and incremental expenses on third-party assets are recognised under other intangible fixed assets if they are not separable from the assets. Otherwise, they are recognised under the specific tangible asset items. Advances to suppliers for the purchase of intangible fixed assets are recognised as assets on the date on which the obligation to pay the relevant amounts arises. Intangible fixed assets in progress are recognised at the date on which the first costs of construction of the asset are incurred and include internal and external costs incurred to create it. Intangible fixed assets are systematically amortised and the amortisation attributed to each period relates to the distribution of the cost incurred over the entire duration of use. The amortisation is calculated from the moment that the asset is available and ready for use. The systematic nature of amortisation depends on the correlation of the expected benefits. Intangible fixed assets are amortised on a straight-line basis as follows: - Start-up and capital costs are amortised over a period of five years. - Development costs are amortised over a period deemed appropriate of three years. - Intangible fixed assets (patent rights, intellectual property rights, concessions, licences and trademarks) are amortised over the shorter of their legal or contractual term and their residual useful life. The estimated useful life of trademarks is no more than 20 years. - Goodwill is systematically amortised according to its useful life with reference to the time period within which the economic benefits associated with it are likely to arise. As it is difficult to reliably estimate useful life, goodwill is amortised over a period deemed appropriate of ten years. - Other assets — leasehold improvements: these are amortised over the shorter of the period of future utility of the expenses incurred and the residual period of the lease, taking into account any renewal period, if this depends on the Company. Intangible fixed assets are revalued, to the extent of their recoverable amount, only if special laws require or permit so. As provided in Article 10 of Law no. 72 of 19 March 1983, and referred to in the subsequent monetary revaluation legislation, no monetary revaluation has ever been carried out on the intangible fixed assets currently in the balance sheet. If there are indicators of impairment of tangible and intangible fixed assets at the reporting date, the recoverable amount is estimated. If their recoverable amount, understood as the greater of their value in use and their fair value, less selling costs, is less than the corresponding net carrying amount, the assets are written down. It was not necessary to carry out write-downs pursuant to Article 2426, paragraph 1, no. 3 of the Italian Civil Code since, as required by accounting standard OIC 9, no indicators of potential impairment of the intangible fixed assets were found.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The purchase cost is the cost actually incurred to purchase the asset and also includes ancillary costs. The production cost includes all direct and general production costs, to the extent reasonably attributable to fixed assets, relating to the production period until the moment from which the asset can be used. Ordinary maintenance costs, relating to maintenance and recurring repairs carried out to maintain assets in a good state of operation to ensure that they fulfil their expected useful life, capacity and original productivity, are recognised in the profit and loss account in the year in which they are incurred. Extraordinary maintenance costs, consisting of extensions, upgrades, replacements and other improvements relating to the asset resulting in a significant and measurable increase in the capacity, productivity or safety of the assets or prolong their useful life, can be capitalised within the limits of the recoverable value of the asset. Depreciation is calculated systematically and consistently, based on the residual useful life of the assets. ----- The following depreciation rates are applied: Plant and machinery 7 years on a straight-line basis Industrial and commercial equipment 8 years on a straight-line basis Vehicles for lifting and internal transport 5 years on a straight-line basis Electronic and electromechanical machinery 5 years on a straight-line basis Ordinary office furniture and machines 8 years on a straight-line basis Miscellaneous equipment 3 years on a straight-line basis Assets under constructions are not subject to depreciation. Obsolete tangible fixed assets and in general those that are permanently no longer used or usable in the production cycle are not depreciated and are valued at the lower of their net carrying amount and their recoverable value.

If their recoverable amount, understood as the greater of their value in use and their fair value, less selling costs, is less than the corresponding net carrying amount, the assets are written down. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, this analysis is carried out in relation to the “cash-generating unit” (hereinafter “CGU”), i.e. the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset being valued and generates cash inflows that are completely independent of the cash inflows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Value in use is determined on the basis of the present value of the future cash flows that are expected to arise from the asset over its useful life, as indicated in the most recent plans approved by the administrative body for the years 2019-2021. Cash flows for years subsequent to those referred to in these plans are determined through projections of the same plans. Future cash flows are estimated by referring to the current condition of fixed assets and therefore do not include inflows or outflows that are expected to result from future restructuring to which the Company is not yet committed, or from the improvement or optimisation of the return on the fixed asset. The discount rate used to calculate present value is the pre-tax rate that reflects current market valuations of the time value of money as well as the specific risks of the asset for which the estimated future cash flows have not been adjusted. This rate is estimated through the weighted average cost of the Company’s capital. The fair value is determined with a priority reference of any price agreed in a binding sale agreement established in a free transaction or the market price in an active market. If there is no binding sale agreement or any active market, the fair value is determined on the basis of the available information that best reflects the amount that the Company could obtain, at the reporting date, by selling the asset in a free transaction between informed, willing parties. The result of recent transactions involving similar assets undertaken within the sector in which the Company operates is considered when determining this amount. To determine the recoverable amount, selling costs are subtracted from the fair value. In the event of impairment, this initially decreases the value of goodwill, if this exists, and then decreases other assets, in proportion to their net carrying amount. ----- The impairment is written back if the reasons for it no longer exist. The write-back is made up to the value that the asset would have had if the adjustment had never taken place, i.e. taking into account the depreciation or amortisation that would have occurred without the write-down.

Otherwise, they are recorded as current assets. Receivables are classified as long-term investments or current assets according to the criterion of their intended purpose with respect to ordinary operations. Accordingly, regardless of maturity, financial receivables are classed as long-term investments, whereas trade receivables are classed as current assets. The valuation criterion for receivables is set out below. _Equity investments_ Equity investments are initially recognised at purchase or creation cost, including the related transaction costs. Transaction costs consist of costs directly attributable to the transaction, such as, for example, banking and financial brokerage costs, fees, expenses and taxes. The carrying amount of equity investments increases as the result of paid capital increases or the waiver of receivables held by the Company with respect to its investee companies. Free capital increases do not increase the value of the equity investments. If the equity investments are impaired at the reporting date, their carrying amount is reduced to the lower recoverable amount, which is determined on the basis of future benefits expected to flow to the Company, until the carrying amount is reduced to zero. In cases where the Company is obliged to bear the losses generated by the investee companies, a provision may be necessary to cover the relevant portion of their equity deficits. If the reasons for the write-down cease to apply in subsequent years, the value of the equity investment is written back, up to a maximum value of the original cost. _Financial receivables_ Financial receivables are recognised at their estimated realisable value as provided for by article 2426.1.8 of the Italian Civil Code. When necessary, they are adjusted to this value through the provision for bad debts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Purchase cost means the actual purchase price plus ancillary charges. As well as the price of the material, the purchase cost of materials includes transport costs, customs duties, other taxes and other costs directly attributable to that material. Returns, trade and other discounts and rewards are deducted from costs. The purchase cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. The realisable value on the basis of market performance is equal to the estimated selling prices of the goods and finished products in the normal course of business, net of the estimated costs of completion and direct selling costs. To determine realisable value on the basis of market performance, account is taken, inter alia, of the rate of obsolescence and the turnaround time of inventories. Obsolete, perishable or slow-moving stocks have therefore been written down by creating a specific provision in relation to their possibility of use or realisation determined on the basis of turnover indices. If the assumptions for the write-down cease to apply in whole or in part as a result of an increase in the realisable value based on the market, the value adjustment made is cancelled up to the limits of the cost originally incurred.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The amortised cost criterion is not applied in cases where its effects are irrelevant, generally for short-term receivables or when the transaction costs, fees paid between the parties and any other difference between the initial value and value on maturity of the receivable are insignificant. Furthermore, pursuant to article 12.2 of Legislative decree no. 139/2015, the company opted not to recognise receivables arising before 1 January 2016 at amortised cost and did not discount them. In this case, receivables are initially recognised at their nominal amount, net of bonuses, discounts and allowances contractually provided for or, in any case, granted. They are subsequently measured at their nominal amount plus interest calculated at the nominal interest rate, reduced by principal and interest collected and net of estimated write-downs and expected credit losses recognised to adjust their carrying amount to their estimated realisable value. With reference to the estimated realisable value, the carrying amount of the receivables is adjusted through an impairment provision to take into account the probability that the receivables are impaired. To this end, specific indicators, indicators based on experience and any other useful factor that make it probable that receivables will become impaired, are taken into consideration. The provision for doubtful debts is estimated through an analysis of individual receivables that are individually significant and at portfolio level for the remaining receivables, determining the losses that are expected to be incurred on the receivables outstanding at the reporting date. Receivables are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the receivable are extinguished or when the ownership of the rights to the cash flows from the receivable is transferred and substantially all the risks related to the receivable are transferred with it. When the receivable is derecognised under the above conditions, the difference between the consideration and the carrying amount of the receivable at the time of assignment is recognised in the profit and loss account as a loss on receivables, unless the assignment agreement allows for other economic items of different kinds, including financial ones, to be identified.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Payables arising from purchases of goods are recognised when the process of producing the goods is completed and the substantial transfer of ownership has taken place, assuming the transfer of risks and benefits as the reference parameter. Payables for services are recognised when the services are received, i.e. when the service has been performed. Loan payables and payables arising for reasons other than the purchase of goods and services are recognised when the Company’s obligation to pay the counterparty arises. Payables for advances from customers are recognised when the right to collect the advance arises. Payables are recognised at amortised cost, considering the time value of money. The amortised cost criterion is not applied in cases where its effects are insignificant, generally for short-term payables or when the transaction costs, fees paid between the parties and any other difference between the initial value and value on maturity of the payable are insignificant. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 2, of Legislative Decree 139/2015, the Company opted not to apply the amortised cost criterion and the discounting of all payables arising before 1 January 2016.

No adjustment was made in the period under review for interest relating to assessment notices received during the year concerning transfer pricing for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016. It should be noted that the MAP (Mutual Agreement Procedure) has been initiated against these notices and is correctly lodged for the three years in question. Given that the outcome of the procedure is still uncertain, it was deemed prudent to maintain the provision made last year for all the amounts in the assessment notices, adjusting the interest until 31 December 2020. In addition, the provision for premises refurbishment was not adjusted. It was also not deemed necessary to adjust the risk provision set up for “non-performing” stores, which at the end of 2020 was substantially reduced due to the general positive sales performance and the containment of operating costs, which significantly reduced the number of underperforming stores. Finally, during the first half of 2021, the allocation of the provision for risks related to the participation of Maxi Zoo Italia SpA in the Payback multi-partner loyalty programme was adjusted. The provision is calculated as a percentage of the number of points accrued under the loyalty programme but not yet used.

Trade payables consist of payables for the supply of goods or services already invoiced or allocated on an accrual basis. The change in trade payables relates to the greater number of store openings in the period under review than in the previous year. The significant increase recorded at 31 December 2020 compared with 30 June 2020 was also linked to the postponement, due to Covid-19, of numerous substantial maintenance works in the last part of the year compared with the previous year. The change in tax payables is related to VAT. Other payables mainly relate to payables to shareholders for dividends to be paid (8,600,000 euro) and payables to employees for remuneration, bonuses and expense claims to be settled, as well as charitable initiatives organised at the stores for which the company undertakes to dedicate a portion of the receipts to not-forprofits, advance rent payments to companies offering telephony services and to companies leasing directional arrows. The decrease of €198,186 recorded in the first half of 2021 compared with 31 December 2020 is mainly due to the lower provision for employee bonuses and the payment to WWF Italia Onlus of the sum collected last year through the “Dai una zampa” (“Give a Paw”) initiative. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Net retail sales amount to €73,398,896 and their value is net of returns and discounts as well as taxes directly related to the sale of products in accordance with the principles of accrual and prudence. The year-on-year increase in sales is 31.9%. This trend is the result of the combined effect of the increase in turnover recorded by the stores in existence at 30 June 2021 and the greater number of stores open at that date (+15). Success factors: growth in demand on the domestic market, acquisition of new customers as a consequence of the price review initiated in 2019 and Payback. Within other revenues and income we have mainly included out of period adjustments recorded during the current year and release of provisions. However, the most significant item continues to be revenues from contracts with goods suppliers for co-marketing initiatives, which at 30 June 2021 amounted to €1,054,092, an increase of €239,755 compared with the same period last year due to an improved negotiation. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

This includes the decision to entrust inventories to qualified external companies, the decision to activate the cash withdrawal and cash granting service at each store and the definition of cyclical maintenance plans to ensure compliance with occupational safety rules.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercised our professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore: — We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; — We obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control; ----- — We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors; — We concluded on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern; — We evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified during our audit.

Notes to the financial statements As of and for the year ended 31 December 2020 INTRODUCTION,3189.178.1,,"The financial statements of Agrifarma S.p.A. (the “Company” or “Agrifarma”) as of and for the year ended 31 December 2020, of which these explanatory notes form an integral part pursuant to art. 2423, par.1 of the Italian Civil Code, correspond to the accounting records regularly kept and are prepared in accordance with articles 2423, 2423-ter,2424, 2424-bis, 2425, 2425-bis, 2425-ter of the Italian Civil Code, and in compliance with the provisions of art. 2423-bis and evaluation criteria pursuant to art. 2426 of the Italian Civil Code. The financial statements include the: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement and Explanatory Notes. The Cash Flow Statement presents the positive or negative changes in cash and cash equivalents during the year and was prepared following the indirect method using the scheme pursuant to accounting standard OIC 10. The Company, even in the presence of controlling shareholdings, has not prepared consolidated financial statements, availing itself of the exemption provided for by art. 27, paragraphs 3 and 4, of Legislative Decree 9 April 1991, no. 127, as the consolidated financial statements will be prepared by the parent company NOAH 1 S.p.A. based in Milan, Via San Paolo 10. The Covid-19 (so-called “Coronavirus”) pandemic, which initially involved China and a few other countries in the Asian area in March 2020, had a strong expansion initially in Italy and subsequently in the rest of Europe, in the United States and more generally in the rest of the world. In this market context, the Company has adopted all the necessary control and prevention measures, in agreement with the local authorities, the supervisory board and all relevant health and safety and other regulations, at its points of sale and headquarters in order to safeguard the health of its employees, but also of its customers and suppliers. In particular, as of 26 February 2020, various information was sent to employees aimed at helping them comply with the Prime Ministerial Decree on the emergency that followed, as well as with the memorandum of understanding signed between trade associations and trade unions. All the necessary safeguards were also distributed and all the measures required by the documents mentioned above were taken. The activity performed by the Company is not included among those subject to total restriction, as it is included among those necessary to guarantee the provision of primary goods and services in this emergency period. The Company, in fact, sells pet food and products necessary for the sustenance of the country’s family pets. It therefore carries out an activity necessary for everyday life, even in a situation of lockdown and social isolation. Despite this, in April the Company suffered a slight decline in revenues due to the closures of some shopping centres on weekends and due to the ban on moving between regions during the lockdown period. The partial reopening of travel in the month of May within the region of residence, and the subsequent total re-opening in June allowed revenues to return to values similar to those prior to lockdown. Finally, it should be noted that Agrifarma purchased the Città degli Animali brand business unit on 30 November 2020, operating in the retail per food and accessories sector, consisting of 5 points of sale operating in the Lombardia region.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Pursuant to OIC 24 par. 37, acquisitions with deferred payment at conditions other than those normally applied on the market are recognized at the value corresponding to the debt determined pursuant to OIC 19. Incorporation and expansion costs relate to the capitalization of costs for the incorporation or expansion of operational capacity and are amortized over 5 years. These incorporation and expansion costs are mainly composed of incorporation costs incurred for the opening of new points of sale. Development costs derive from the application of the results of basic research or other knowledge owned or acquired, before the beginning of commercial production or use, and are amortized according to their useful life which has been estimated at 3 years. Industrial patents and intellectual property rights are amortized based on their expected period of use, which cannot exceed the contract duration. Industrial patents and intellectual property rights are amortized over a period of 5 years. The value attributed to trademarks for registration and maintenance costs was amortized over 3 years. The value attributed to the ARCAPLANET trademark in the allocation of part of the merger deficit, which took place at the end of 2016, was the subject to an appraisal report, which also determined the estimated useful life of 20 years. To date, there are no indicators of impairment. Goodwill is determined by the difference between the total price incurred for the acquisition of the company and the fair value of the assets and liabilities that are transferred. Goodwill is amortized over its useful life and, in exceptional cases in which it is not possible to reliably estimate its useful life, goodwill is amortized over a period not exceeding ten years. When the useful life of goodwill is estimated to be over 10 years, objective facts and circumstances are required to support this estimate. In any case, the useful life of the goodwill cannot exceed 20 years. For further details, see the note on intangible fixed assets. Assets under development are not amortized. Improvement expenses on third party assets, recorded in other intangible assets, are amortized over the estimated useful life or, if shorter, the remaining lease term, taking into account any renewal period, if at the option of the tenant. Fixed assets are impaired when the estimated residual value is lower than the book value. Impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the impairment no longer apply in the subsequent years. The capitalisation and valuation of intangible fixed assets was performed with the consent of the Board of Statutory Auditors where required by the Italian Civil Code. In accordance with the provisions of accounting standard OIC 9, the Company performs an impairment test for goodwill if there is an indication that value is impaired, carries out an impairment test considering the entity as a whole.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Pursuant to OIC 26 par. 33, acquisitions with deferred payment at conditions other than those normally applied on the market are recognized at the value corresponding to the debt determined pursuant to OIC 19. The costs incurred in relation to the expansion, modernization and improvement of existing assets, as well as those incurred to render them more effective or for any extraordinary maintenance performed in accordance with the provisions of OIC 16 par. 49 to 53, were only capitalized if there was a significant and measurable increase in the asset’s production capacity or useful life. For these assets, depreciation was applied on a straight line, based on the new book value, taking into account their residual useful life. For tangible fixed assets consisting of components with different useful life, in accordance with the provisions of OIC 16 in paragraph 45 and 46, the values of the individual assets were determined in order to identify the different duration of their useful life. The cost of fixed assets whose use is limited in time is systematically depreciated each year based on economictechnical rates determined in relation to the residual possibility of use. All the assets have been depreciated, including those temporarily not in use, with the only exception being those with unlimited useful life, which consist of land, non-instrumental buildings, and civil works. The depreciation starts from the moment the assets are available and ready for use. Amortization of assets acquired during the year is based on 50% of the annual depreciation and the rates have been applied in accordance with OIC 16 par. 61. Depreciation rates, in accordance with OIC 16 paragraph 70 are reviewed in the event of a change in the residual useful life. Obsolete assets and those that will no longer be used or usable in the production cycle, based on OIC 16 par. 80, have not been depreciated and have been valued at the lower value between the net book value and the recoverable value. The depreciation rates applied are specified below: Buildings: 3% Temporary constructions: 10% Plant and machinery: 15% Industrial and commercial equipment: 15% Other assets: - furniture and fixtures: 12% - electronic office equipment: 20% - transport vehicles: 20% - cars: 25% The depreciation rates are consistent with the previous year. Pursuant to OIC 21 par. 21, acquisitions with deferred payment at conditions other than those normally applied on the market are recognized at the value corresponding to the debt determined pursuant to OIC 19. The “time factor” referred to in art. 2426, par. 1, no. 8, of the Italian Civil Code was also taken into account by discounting non-current receivables in the event of a significant difference between the effective interest rate and the market rate. Receivables for which the amortized cost criterion was not applied were recognized at their estimated realizable value. Regardless of whether or not the amortized cost was applied, receivables are shown in the financial statements net of the recognition of a bad debt provision relating to the receivables deemed non-collectable, as well as the generic risk relating to the remaining receivables. This risk relies on estimates based on past experience, the trend in the seniority indices of overdue receivables, the general economic situation, sector and country risk, and events occurring after the close of the financial year that have an impact on the values at the financial statements date. In accordance with OIC 31 par. 19, given that the criterion of classification by nature of costs prevails, the allocations to the provisions for risks and charges are recorded among the asset items to which the transaction refers (characteristic, ancillary or financial).",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Pursuant to OIC 13 par. 22, acquisitions with deferred payment at conditions other than those normally applied on the market are recognized at the value corresponding to the debt determined pursuant to OIC 19.

Development costs derive from the application of the results of basic research or other knowledge owned or acquired, before the beginning of commercial production or use, and are amortized according to their useful life which has been estimated at 3 years. Industrial patents and intellectual property rights are amortized based on their expected period of use, which caannot exceed the contract duration. Industrial patents and intellectual property rights are amortized over a period of 5 years. The value attributed to trademarks for registration and maintenance costs was amortized over 3 years. The value attributed to the ARCAPLANET trademark in the allocation of part of the merger deficit, which took place at the end of 2016, was the subject to an appraisal report,which also determined the estimated useful life of 20 years. To date, there are no indicators of impairment. Goodwill is determined by the difference between the total price incurred for the acquisition of the company and the fair value of the assets and liabilities that are transferred. Goodwill is amortized over its useful life and, in exceptional cases in which it is not possible to reliably estimate its useful life, goodwill is amortized over a period not exceeding ten years. When the useful life of goodwill is estimated to be over 10 years, objective facts and circumstances are required to support this estimate. In any case, the useful life of the goodwill cannot exceed 20 years. For further details, see the note on intangible fixed assets. Assets under development are not amortized. Improvement expenses on third party assets, recorded in other intangible assets, are amortized over the estimated useful life or, if shorter, the remaining lease term, taking into account any renewal period, if at the option of the tenant. Fixed assets are impaired when the estimated residual value is lower than the book value. Impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the impairment no longer apply in the subsequent years. The capitalisation and valuation of intangible fixed assets was performed with the consent of the Board of Statutory Auditors where required by the Italian Civil Code. In accordance with the provisions of accounting standard OIC 9, the Company performs an impairment test for goodwill if there is an indication that value is impaired, carries out an impairment test considering the entity as a whole . For these assets, depreciation was applied on a straight line, based on the new book value, taking into account their residual useful life. For tangible fixed assets consisting of components with different useful life, in accordance with the provisions of OIC 16 in paragraph 45 and 46, the values of the individual assets were determined in order to identify the different duration of their useful life. The cost of fixed assets whose use is limited in time is systematically depreciated each year based on economictechnical rates determined in relation to the residual possibility of use. All the assets have been depreciated, including those temporarily not in use, with the only exception being those with unlimited useful life, which consist of land, non-instrumental buildings, and civil works. The depreciation starts from the moment the assets are available and ready for use. Amortization of assets acquired during the year is based on 50% of the annual depreciation and the rates have been applied in accordance with OIC 16 par. 61. Depreciation rates, in accordance with OIC 16 paragraph 70 are reviewed in the event of a change in the residual useful life. Obsolete assets and those that will no longer be used or usable in the production cycle, based on OIC 16 par. 80, have not been depreciated and have been valued at the lower value between the net book value and the recoverable value. The deprecition rates applied are specified below: Buildings: 3% Temporary constructions: 10% Plant and machinery: 15% Industrial and commercial equipment: 15% Other assets: - furniture and fixtures: 12% - electronic office equipment: 20% - transport vehicles: 20% - cars: 25% The depreciation rates are consistent with the previous year. generic risk relating to the remaining receivables. This risk relies on estimates based on past experience, the trend in the seniority indices of overdue receivables, the general economic situation, sector and country risk, and events occurring after the close of the financial year that have an impact on the values at the financial statements date. In accordance with OIC 25 paragraphs 53 to 85, the provision for deferred taxes also includes deferred taxes arising from extraordinary transactions, revaluation of assets and suspended taxation that are not reflected in the Income Statement or in net equity.

Industrial patents and intellectual property rights are amortized based on their expected period of use, which cannot exceed the contract duration, industrial patents and intellectual property rights are amortized over a period of 5 years. The value attributed to trademarks for registration and maintenance costs was amortized over 3 years. The value attributed to the ARCAPLANET trademark in the allocation of part of the merger deficit, which took place at the end of 2016, was the subject to an appraisal report, which also determined the estimated useful life of 20 years. To date, there are no indicators of impairment. Goodwill is determined by the difference between the total price incurred for the acquisition of the company and the fair value of the assets and liabilities that are transferred. Goodwill is amortized over its useful life and, in exceptional cases in which it is not possible to reliably estimate its useful life, goodwill is amortized over a period not exceeding ten years. When the useful life of goodwill is estimated to be over 10 years, objective facts and circumstances are required to support this estimate. In any case, the useful life of the goodwill cannot exceed 20 years. For further details, see the note on intangible fixed assets. Asset under development are not amortized. Improvement expenses on third party assets, recorded in other intangible assets, are amortized over the estimated useful life or, if shorter, the remaining lease term, taking into account any renewal period, if at the option of the tenant. Fixed assets are impaired when the estimated residual value is lower than the book value. Impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the impairment no longer apply in the subsequent years. The capitalisation and valuation of intangible fixed assets was performed with the consent of the Board of Statutory Auditors where required by the Italian Civil Code. In accordance with the provisions of accounting standard OIC 9, the Company performs an impairment test for goodwill if there is an indication that value is impaired, carries out an impairment test considering the entity as a whole. The cost of fixed assets whose use is limited in time is systematically depreciated each year based on economictechnical rates determined in relation to the residual possibility of use. All the assets have been depreciated, including those temporarily not in use, with the only exception being those with unlimited useful life, which consist of land, non-instrumental buildings, and civil works. The depreciation starts from the moment the assets are available and ready for use. Amortization of assets acquired during the year is based on 50% of the annual depreciation and the rate shave been applied in accordance with OIC 16 par. 61. Depreciation rates, in accordance with OIC 16 paragraph 70 are reviewed in the event of a change in the residual useful life. Obsolete assets and those that will no longer be used or usable in the production cycle, based on OIC 16 par. 80, have not been depreciated and have been valued at the lower value between the net book value and the recoverable value. The depreciation rates applied are specified below: Buildings: 3% Temporary constructions: 10% Plant and machinery: 15% Industrial and commercial equipment: 15% Other assets: - furniture and fixtures: 12% - electronic office equipment: 20% - transport vehicles: 20% - cars: 25% normal management, having regard to the information available from the market. For the purposes of determining the realizable value, market trends are used taking into account the rate of obsolescence and turnaround times, among others. The obsolescence rate relates to the slow turnover of goods in stock and is calculated based on estimates made on low-turnover products. At the end of each financial year, the Company makes estimates in order to verify the need to adjust the inventory obsolescence fund. Deferred tax assets have been recognized where there is reasonable certainty that they will be recovered in the future, as proven by a tax plan for a reasonable period of time that provides sufficient taxable income to use the losses carried forward and/or by the presence of sufficient taxable time differences to absorb the losses carried forward. income taxes are calculated on the cumulative amount of all temporary differences between the values of assets and liabilities, as determined using statutory accounting criteria with their values recognized for tax purposes. Deferred and prepaid income taxes are recognized in the financial year in which the temporary differences emerge and are calculated by applying the tax rates in effect during the financial year in which the temporary differences will be reversed. This applies when these rates have already been defined on the reference date for the financial statements; otherwise they are calculated based on the rates in effect on the reference date for the financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Current and non-currant amounts are classified based on the contractual or legal maturity, also taking into account facts and events that may lead to a change in the original maturity. Payables originating from acquisitions of assets are entered at the time when the risks, charges and benefits are transferred; those relating to services are recognized when the service is performed; financial and other types when the obligation to the counter-party arises.

To date, no elements have emerged such as to suggest the impairment of goodwill recorded in the financial statements. It should be noted that the Other intangible fixed assets, as indicated above, are mainly made up of the expenses that the Company incurs on third party properties leased and used as points of sale. These expenses are amortized in the shorter period between the future usefulness of the expenses incurred and the residual period of the lease.

However, in the first months of 2021 the containment measures of the COVID-19 virus imposed by the Government continued, although the launch of the vaccination campaign favourably reflects on the longerterm prospects. Despite the difficulties in facing the pandemic, forecasts remain positive. In fact, the growth trend recorded in recent years is expected to continue, without any particular negative impacts on the business, considering the pandemic as a completely exceptional event that did not compromise the business continuity, profitability and capital strength of the Company. The current health emergency does not constitute an event that entails adjustments to the items recorded in the Company’s financial statements as of 31 December 2020. Based on the information and estimates available to date, we also do not believe that the Company’s business could suffer any repercussions such as to question the Company’s continuity. The management is not aware of any significant uncertainties relating to events or conditions that could lead to the emergence of serious doubts on the ability of the Company to continue to operate as a going concern. Pursuant to art. 2427, par. 1, no. 22 quater), of the Italian Civil Code, it should be noted that the pandemic linked to Covid-19 in March 2020 (so-called “Coronavirus”) which initially involved China and a few other countries in the Asian area, had a strong expansion initially in Italy and subsequently in the rest of Europe, in the United States and more generally in the rest of the world. In this market context, the Company has adopted all the necessary control and prevention measures, in agreement with the local authorities, the supervisory board and all the relevant health and safety and other regulations, at its points of sale and headquarters in order to safeguard the health of its employees, but also of its customers and suppliers. In particular, as of 26 February 2020, various information was sent to employees aimed at helping them comply with the Prime Ministerial Decree on the emergency that followed, as well as with the memorandum of understanding signed between trade associations and trade unions. All the necessary safeguards were also distributed and all the measures required by the documents mentioned above were taken. The activity performed by the Company is not included among those subject to total restriction, as it is included among those necessary to guarantee the provision of primary goods and services in this emergency period. The Company, in fact, sells pet food and products necessary for the sustenance of the country’s family pets. It therefore carries out an activity necessary for everyday life, even in a situation of lockdown and social isolation. Despite this, in April the Company suffered a slight decline in revenues due to the closures of some shopping centres on weekends and due to the ban on moving between regions during the lockdown period. The partial reopening of travel in the month of May within the region of residence, and the subsequent total re-opening in June allowed revenues to return to values similar to those prior to lockdown. The Company is confident that turnover will have returned to levels higher than that pre-Covid by the end of June. From the profitability standpoint, the Company believes that it is not yet possible to estimate the impact that this pandemic will have during the year. The decline in the population’s 2020 forecast spending power, as a consequence of the experienced health and economic crisis, could have an impact, albeit limited, on per capita goods consumption. However, we believe that, given the primary utility nature of the goods marketed by the Company and the Company’s ability to react also to the phases of economic crisis, already experienced in previous decades, the impact could be limited. The current health emergency does not constitute an event that entails adjustments to the items recorded in the Company’s financial statements as of 31 December 2019. Based on the information and estimates available to date, we also do not believe that the Company’s business could suffer any repercussions such as to question the Company’s continuity. The management is not aware of any significant uncertainties relating to events or conditions that could lead to the emergence of serious doubts on the ability of the Company to continue to operate as a going concern. ----- The chain now has 239 points of sale, and the revenue during the first two months showed a growth of 13.9% with respect to the same period in 2018. In fact, given the increasing focus on the chain’s continued growth, the Company is committed to improving its organisational and sales business processes, and to seeking out new potential areas for further development.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercised our professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore: — We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; — We obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control; ----- — We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors; — We concluded on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern; — We evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified during our audit.

The financial statements include the: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement and Explanatory Notes. The Cash Flow Statement presents the positive or negative changes in cash and cash equivalents during the year and was prepared following the indirect method using the scheme pursuant to accounting standard OIC 10. The Company, even in the presence of controlling shareholdings, has not prepared consolidated financial statements, availing itself of the exemption provided for by art. 27, paragraphs 3 and 4, of Legislative Decree 9 April 1991, no. 127, as the consolidated financial statements will be prepared by the parent company NOAH 1 S.p.A. based in Milan, Via San Paolo 10. On 30 October 2019, with effect from 1 November 2019, Agrifarma acquired the 100% stake in the company Arcawip S.r.l., for a provisional consideration of Euro 2,686,655. This consideration is subject to adjustment, as per the Preliminary Business Purchase Agreement signed on 23 July 2019, and was definitively determined at Euro 2,381,272. The company Arcawip S.r.l. was established on 23 September 2019, registered in the register of companies on 27 September 2019 and was the beneficiary of a business branch transfer by the former shareholder on 24 October 2019 with effect from 1 November 2019. The company conferred is represented by the branch called “Pet Food”, operating in the retail pet food and accessory sector through 11 points of sale located in the Lombardia, Piemonte and Veneto regions. On 31 May 2019, Agrifarma purchased the business unit relating to the stores sold by Zoodom Italia S.r.l., operating in the retail pet food and accessory sector, consisting of 15 points of sale operating in the Abruzzo, Lombardia, Veneto and Marche regions under the “Zoodom” brand. On 24 May 2018, Agrifarma purchased a shareholding of 297,000 shares, in the company Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A. for a price of Euro 24 million. Subsequently, on 29 May 2019, Noah S.p.A contributed its shareholding of 202,500 shares in Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A. to Agrifarma thorough a capital increase of Euro 64,720, and a share premium of Euro 14,935,280, subscribed by the Sole Shareholder Noah 2 S.p.A. Following these two transactions, Agrifarma, as at 31 December 2018, held a 100% stake in Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A., a company operating in the same sector as Agrifarma and owner of 71 points of sale in Piemonte, Liguria, Valle d’Aosta, Lombardia and Emilia Romagna. Subsequently, on 16 September 2019, the Boards of Directors of Agrifarma and Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A. prepared a plan for the merger by incorporation of Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A. into Agrifarma, drawn up pursuant to and for the purposes of articles 2501-bis and 2501-ter of the Italian Civil Code. This merger plan with the annexed documents (including the report of the auditing company required pursuant to art. 2501-bis, par. 5, of the Italian Civil Code), with the reports of the administrative bodies drawn up pursuant to art. 2501-quinquies, of the code and with the expert report pursuant to art. 2501-bis, par. 4, of the Italian Civil Code were the subject of a resolution discussed at the Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A. and Agrifarma shareholders’ meetings on 7 October 2019.

In light of the above, these financial statements represent the effects of the merger by incorporation of Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A. As required by accounting standard OIC 4, in order to understand the effects of the merger, a table is disclosed in the explanatory notes that allows a homogeneous comparison between the values as at 31 December 2019 (without the effect of the merger) and those of the previous year.

The directors areresponsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and, in preparing the financial statements, for the appropriate application of the going concern basis of accounting, and for disclosing matters related to going concern. In preparing the financial statements, the directors use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercised our professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore: — We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; — We obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control; ----- — We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors; — We concluded on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern; — We evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified during our audit.

The financial statements include the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement and Explanatory Notes. The Cash Flow Statement presents the positive or negative changes in cash, cash equivalents during the year, and was prepared following the indirect method using the scheme pursuant to accounting standard OIC 10. The Company, even in the presence of controlling shareholdings, has not prepared consolidated financial statements, availing itself of the exemption provided for by art. 27, paragraphs 3 and 4, of Legislative Decree no. 127 of 9 April 1991, as the consolidated financial statements will be prepared by the parent company NOAH 2 S.p.A. based in Milan, Via San Paolo 10. On 2 February 2018, by means of a notarial public deed stipulated by Atty. Simona Gaggini, the limited company Arcaplanet SA was established with headquarters in Lugano, Switzerland. Arcaplanet SA conducts the same business activities as Agrifarma through two sales outlets located in Grancia and Morbio Inferiore. On 24 May 2018, Agrifarma purchased a shareholding of 297,000 shares, in the company Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A. for a price of Euro 24 million. Subsequently, on 29 May 2019, Noah S.p.A contributed its shareholding of 202,500 shares in Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A. to Agrifarma thorough a capital increase of Euro 64,720, and a share premium of Euro 14,935,280, subscribed by the Sole Shareholder Noah 2 S.p.A. A valuation of the aforementioned shares was prepared by Professor Pozza, an independent expert pursuant to art. 2343-ter, paragraph 2, lett. b), of the Italian Civil Code. Following these two transactions, Agrifarma held a 100% stake in Mondial Pet Distribution S.p.A., a company operating in the same sector as Agrifarma and owner of 71 points of sale in Piemonte, Liguria, Valle d’Aosta, Lombardia and Emilia Romagna.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Notes to the financial statements As of and for the year ended 31 December 2018,3201.170.1,,"Deferred taxes mainly contain the reversals relating to the initial recognition of the “Provision for deferred taxes” which directly affected shareholders’ equity in 2016. As already stated, the deferred tax provision was set aside during the year, in compliance with OIC 4, at the time of allocation of part of the merger deficit on the ARCAPLANET trademark. The portion of the deferred tax provision relating to the amortization of the ARCAPLANET trademark pertaining to the year was released in the current year. This release is equal to Euro 915,114. Taxes relating to previous years relate to the lower IRES for 2017 which, when quantifying the benefit relating to the patent box, revealed a contingent asset. The following tables were prepared based on the recommendations contained in OIC 25, and illustrate the information required by art. 2427, par. 1, no. 14, letters a) and b) of the Italian Civil Code. In particular, they contain information on the summary values of the changes during the year in “Comprehensive prepaid and deferred taxation”, on the composition of the deductible temporary differences that originated “Deferred tax assets” and on the composition of the taxable temporary differences that originated “Liabilities for deferred taxes”. paragraph 125, the disclosure obligation would only concern payments of an “individual” nature. While considering the Assonime position to be broadly acceptable, pending a more general interpretation of the provision in question, and given the potential magnitude of the consequences of the failure to fulfil the aforementioned disclosure obligation, the Company has decided to also include in these financial statements all contributions received from government offices that can be used by all the companies, and that fall under the general structure of the reference system laid out by the State, with the exception of those associated with tax and/or contribution benefits. During the course of the financial year, the Company received grants, contributions, paid assignments, and other economic benefits covered by art. 1, paragraph 125 of Law no. 124 of 2017, amounting to a total of Euro 126,735.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA Italia will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISA Italia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: — identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; — obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control; — evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors; — conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern; — evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at the appropriate level required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

They consist of a balance sheet, a profit and loss account, a cash flow statement and these notes. The cash flow statement shows the reasons for increases and decreases in cash and cash equivalents during the year and has been prepared under the indirect method, using the layout provided for by OIC 10. The amounts presented in the balance sheet, profit and loss account and cash flow statement are in Euros, without decimal points, while those disclosed in the notes are expressed in thousands of Euros, except as otherwise specified (article 2423.6 of the Italian Civil Code). Captions with a nil balance in both the current and previous years have been omitted. Additional information is provided when that required by the specific legal provisions is insufficient to give a true and fair view. The post-balance sheet events, the proposed allocation of the net profit for the year and the total off-balance sheet commitments, guarantees and contingent liabilities are presented in specific sections of these notes. Pursuant to article 2497 and following articles of the Italian Civil Code, the company is managed and coordinated by Fressnapf Beteiligungs GmbH and, therefore, these notes present the key figures derived from the most recent financial statements of this company. Maxi Zoo Italia S.p.A. is controlled by Fressnapf Beteiligungs GmbH, incorporated in Germany under Germany law with its registered office in Westpreussenstrasse 32/38, Krefeld (Germany), which prepares consolidated financial statements of the largest group of companies to which Maxi Zoo Italia S.p.A. belongs.

Captions have been recognised and presented in accordance with the substance over form principle, if in compliance with the Italian Civil Code and the OIC. The company has also complied with the principles of measurement consistency, materiality and comparability of information. As a result: The company measures the individual assets and liabilities separately, in order to avoid offsetting profits on certain items against losses on other items. Specifically, the company recognises profits only if realised before the reporting date, whereas it considers risks and losses on an accruals basis, even when they become known after the reporting date. The company recognises income and expense pertaining to the year regardless of when it is collected or paid. They are, therefore, recognised in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis in order to be included in the net profit or loss for the year. The directors assessed the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future, i.e., for at least twelve months from the reporting date. They did not identify any uncertainties in this respect. Identification of rights, obligations and conditions is based on the contractual terms of transactions and the reporting standards to check the correctness of the recognition or derecognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and costs. The accounting policies are unchanged from the previous year to ensure the comparability of the financial statements from one year to the next. ----- No exceptional events took place during the year, which would have led the company to depart from the accounting policies, as permitted by article 2423.5 of the Italian Civil Code, in order to give a true and fair view of its financial position and results of operations. Moreover, the company did not make any revaluations under specific laws. The materiality of the financial statements captions was assessed considering the financial statements as a whole and both qualitative and quantitative factors. Under the principle of materiality set out in article 2423.4 of the Italian Civil Code, these notes do not include disclosures on the financial statements captions whose amount or related disclosure are immaterial for the purposes of giving a true and fair view of the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows, including those specifically required by article 2427 of the Italian Civil Code or other provisions.

They are stated net of accumulated amortisation and any write-downs. The acquisition cost includes the related transaction costs. The development cost includes all directly attributable costs and the reasonably attributable portion of other costs incurred from development up to when the asset is available for use. Deferred charges, which include start-up and capital costs, are recognised with the approval of the board of statutory auditors when their income generating potential can be demonstrated, the related future economic benefits flowing to the company can be objectively matched thereto and their recovery can be reasonably estimated. Intangible fixed assets, comprising intellectual property rights, are recognised as assets only if they can be identified individually, the related future economic benefits will flow to the company, which can limit third-party access to such benefits, and their cost can be estimated with sufficient reliability. Goodwill is recognised with the approval of the board of statutory auditors as an asset only if acquired against consideration, may be quantified, originates from charges and costs with a long-term useful life which ensure future economic benefits and can, therefore, be recovered. Leasehold improvements are recognised under other intangible fixed assets when they cannot be separated from the related assets, otherwise they are recognised under the relevant tangible fixed assets captions. Advances to suppliers for intangible fixed assets are recognised when the related payments are due. Assets under development are recognised when the initial costs to develop the asset are incurred and they include the related internal and external costs. ----- Intangible fixed assets are amortised systematically and the amortisation expensed each year reflects the allocation of the cost incurred over their entire useful life. Amortisation begins when the asset is available for use. The amortisation pattern depends on how the benefits are expected to flow to the company. Intangible fixed assets are amortised on a straight-line basis, as follows: - Start-up and capital costs are amortised over five years. - Development costs are amortised over three years. - Patents, intellectual property rights, concessions, licences and trademarks, are amortised over the shorter of the legal or contractual term and their expected useful life. The estimated useful life of trademarks cannot exceed 20 years. - Goodwill is amortised systematically over its useful life, i.e., the period of time within which the related economic benefits will probably arise. When the company is unable to reliably estimate its useful life, goodwill is amortised over a period of ten years. - Other — leasehold improvements are amortised over the shorter of their useful life and the residual lease term, considering any renewal period, if at the company’s option. Assets under development are not amortised. The amortisation process begins when these assets are reclassified to their relevant intangible fixed asset caption. Intangible fixed assets are revalued, to the extent of their recoverable amount, only if special laws require or permit so. In accordance with article 10 of Law no. 72 of 19 March 1983, as also referred to in subsequent monetary revaluation laws, it is noted that the company has never subjected its intangible fixed assets to monetary revaluations. If, at the reporting date, there are indications of impairment losses on tangible and intangible fixed assets, the recoverable amount of such assets is estimated. If the recoverable amount, being the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, is lower than the corresponding carrying amount, the assets are written down. The company did not write down capitalised costs as per article 2426.1.3 of the Italian Civil Code as it did not identify indicators of impairment of its intangible fixed assets in accordance with OIC 9.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612
1794_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,3201,INCOME TAX EXPENSE,3201.220,Tangible fixed assets,3201.220.1,,"Tangible fixed assets are recognised at purchase or production cost, adjusted by accumulated depreciation and write-downs. The purchase cost is the cost actually incurred to purchase the asset and includes the related transaction costs. The production cost includes all directly attributable charges and the reasonably attributable portion of other costs incurred from production up to when the asset is available for use. Ordinary maintenance costs related to recurring maintenance and repairs to keep assets in good working order to ensure their expected useful life, capacity and original productivity, are expensed when incurred. Extraordinary maintenance costs incurred to expand, modernise, replace or improve an asset are capitalised within the limits of its recoverable amount if they result in a significant and measurable increase in its production capacity, safety or useful life. Depreciation is calculated systematically and on a straight-line basis, using rates held to reflect the asset’s estimated useful life. Depreciation begins when the asset is available for use. Temporarily unused assets are also depreciated. The amount to be depreciated is the difference between the cost of the asset and, when it can be calculated, the residual amount at the end of its useful life which is estimated when the depreciation plan is prepared and ----- periodically revised in order to check that the initial estimate is still valid. When the check shows that an asset’s estimated residual value is equal to or higher than its carrying amount, the asset is no longer depreciated. The company applies the following depreciation criteria: Plant and machinery 7 years on a straight-line basis Industrial and commercial equipment 8 years on a straight-line basis Lifting equipment and internal transport 5 years on a straight-line basis Electronic and electromechanical equipment 5 years on a straight-line basis Ordinary office furniture and equipment 8 years on a straight-line basis Sundry and small equipment 3 years on a straight-line basis Obsolete tangible fixed assets and, in general, those that are no longer used or can no longer be used in production permanently are not depreciated and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and recoverable amount. Tangible fixed assets are revalued, to the extent of their recoverable amount, only if special laws require or permit so. In accordance with article 10 of Law no. 72 of 19 March 1983, as also referred to in subsequent monetary revaluation laws, it is noted that the company has never subjected its tangible fixed assets to monetary revaluations.

If the recoverable amount, being the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, is lower than the corresponding carrying amount, the assets are written down. When the recoverable amount of an asset cannot be estimated, it is tested for impairment at cash-generating unit (“CGU”) level, that is, the lowest identifiable level for assets, which includes the assets to be measured and generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Value in use is calculated on the basis of the present value of the future cash flows that the company expects to derive from the asset over its useful life, based on the most recent plans approved by the board of directors for the 2019-2021 period. The future cash flows for the years subsequent to those covered by the plan period are calculated by projecting the plan figures. Future cash flows are estimated for the asset in its current condition. Therefore, they do not include estimated future cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from a future restructuring to which the company is not yet committed or improving or enhancing the asset’s performance. The discount rate applied to calculate the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. This rate is estimated based on the company’s weighted average cost of capital. Fair value is determined based on the price agreed in a binding sales agreement in an orderly transaction, or as market price on an active market. If there is no binding sales agreement or an active market, fair value is determined on the basis of the best available information such to reflect the amount the company could obtain, at the reporting date, from the sale of the asset in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. In determining this amount, an entity considers the outcome of recent transactions for similar assets within the same industry. Costs of disposal are subtracted from fair value in the calculation of the recoverable amount. ----- If an impairment loss is identified, it is firstly recognised as a decrease in goodwill, if any, and then in the other assets proportionally to their carrying amount. The write-down is not maintained in subsequent years if the reasons therefor cease to exist. The write-down is reversed up to the amount the asset would have had if the write-down had never taken place, that is, net of the amortisation/depreciation that would have been recognised in the absence of the write-down. Write-downs of goodwill and deferred charges cannot be reversed.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Otherwise, they are recognised under current assets. Receivables are recognised under fixed or current assets depending on their intended use in relation to the company’s ordinary activities that generate them. Accordingly, financial receivables are recognised under financial fixed assets, whereas trade receivables are recognised under current assets, regardless of their due date. They are measured as detailed below. _Equity investments_ They are initially recognised at acquisition or incorporation cost, including the related transaction costs. The latter comprise costs that are directly attributable to the transaction such as, for example, bank and financial brokerage fees, commissions, expenses and taxes. The carrying amount of investments rises as a result of capital increases against consideration or the company’s waivers of repayment of receivables from the investees. Any bonus issue does not increase the investments’ carrying amount. They are written down for impairment, when their carrying amount decreases to below their recoverable amount at the reporting date. The recoverable amount is calculated based on the economic benefits the company expects to receive from the investment. They are written down to the extent of the carrying amount. If the company has an obligation to cover an investee’s losses, it sets up a provision under liabilities to cover its share of the investee’s deficit. Equity investments are written back up to their original cost if the reasons for the write-downs cease to exist. _Financial receivables_ Financial receivables are recognised at their estimated realisable value as provided for by article 2426.1.8 of the Italian Civil Code.

Purchase cost is the actual cost paid upon purchase including related charges. The purchase cost of materials includes their price, transport costs, customs and other duties and other directly attributable costs. Returns, commercial discounts, rebates and bonuses are deducted from costs. Purchase cost is calculated using the weighted average cost method. The estimated realisable value based on market trends is the estimate of ordinary sales prices of goods and finished products, net of estimated completion costs and direct sales costs. Obsolescence and turnover are also taken into account in calculating the estimated realisable value based on market trends. Obsolete, perishable or slow-moving items are written down through the related provision based on their possible use or realisation determined using turnover ratios. If the reasons for their write-down are no longer entirely or partly valid due to an increase in their realisable value, the write-down is reversed up to the amount of their original cost.

The amortised cost method is not applied when its effects are irrelevant, which is usually the case for current receivables or when transaction costs, commissions paid between the parties and any other difference between the original and recoverable amounts at the due date are insignificant. Furthermore, pursuant to article 12.2 of Legislative decree no. 139/2015, the company opted not to recognise receivables arising before 1 January 2016 at amortised cost and did not discount them. In this case, receivables are initially recognised at their nominal amount, net of bonuses, discounts and allowances contractually provided for or, in any case, granted. They are subsequently measured at their nominal amount plus interest calculated at the nominal interest rate, reduced by principal and interest collected and net of estimated write-downs and expected credit losses recognised to adjust their carrying amount to their estimated realisable value. The company recognises these receivables at their estimated realisable value by writing down their carrying amount through the provision for bad debts, in order to provide for any risk of impairment. To this end, the company considers specific indicators based on past trends and any other useful information about a probable impairment. The write-downs are estimated on an individual basis for significant receivables and collectively for the others, by calculating the expected impairment losses at the reporting date. Receivables are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the receivable are extinguished or title thereto is transferred along with nearly all the related risks. When the above-mentioned conditions are met and the receivable is derecognised, any difference between the amount collected and the receivable’s carrying amount is recognised as an impairment loss in the profit and loss account, unless another classification, including financial, may be identified based on the transfer agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

Specifically, provisions for risks relate to specific liabilities whose occurrence is probable and amount estimated, while provisions for charges relate to specific liabilities, whose occurrence is certain and amount or due date estimated, that arise from obligations already taken on at the reporting date but which will be paid in subsequent years. Accruals to provisions for risks and charges are primarily recognised in the profit and loss account section to which the transaction relates, privileging the classification of costs by nature. The amount of the accruals to the provisions is based on the best estimate of costs, including the legal expenses, at each reporting date. If the measurement of the accruals gives a range of values, the accrual represents the best possible estimate between the upper and lower thresholds of the range. The provisions are subsequently used directly and solely for those costs and liabilities for which they were originally set up. If they are not sufficient or are redundant, the shortfall or surplus is recognised in the profit and loss account in line with the original accrual.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The overall accrued benefit considers any type of continuous remuneration and is net of any payments on account and partial advances paid by virtue of national or individual labour contracts or company agreements which are not required to be repaid and the benefits transferred to the supplementary pension plans or the treasury fund managed by INPS (the Italian social security institution).

Payables are recognised in line with their nature (or original) in relation to the company’s ordinary activities that generate them, regardless of their due date. Payables arising from the purchase of goods are recognised when the production process for the goods has been completed and the substantial transfer of title has taken place, with the transfer of risks and benefits being the key parameter. Payables relating to services are recognised once the services have been delivered, i.e., when they have been carried out. Loans and borrowings and payables unrelated to the procurement of goods and services are recognised when the company has an obligation vis-a-vis the counterparty. Payables for advances from customers are recognised when the right to collect the advance arises. Payables are recognised at amortised cost, considering the time value of money. The amortised cost method is not applied when its effects are irrelevant, which is usually the case for current payables or when transaction costs, commissions paid between the parties and any other difference between the original and settlement amounts at the due date are insignificant. Furthermore, pursuant to article 12.2 of Legislative decree no. 139/2015, the company opted not to recognise payables arising before 1 January 2016 at amortised cost and did not discount them. ----- In this case, payables are initially recognised at their nominal amount, net of bonuses, discounts and allowances contractually provided for or, in any case, granted. They are subsequently measured at their nominal amount plus interest calculated at the nominal interest rate, reduced by principal and interest paid. In the event of early settlement, the difference between the residual outstanding amount and the outlay to settle the obligation is recognised as financial income or charges. Cash discounts and allowances that were not included in the calculation of the carrying amount at initial recognition as they could not be determined when the payable was originally recognised, are recognised upon settlement as financial income. Payables are derecognised, in whole or in part, when the relevant contractual and/or legal obligations are extinguished for settlement or other reasons, or are transferred.

Revenues from the sale of goods are recognised upon the substantial rather than formal transfer of title, with the transfer of risks and benefits being the key parameter. Revenues from the provision of services are recognised once the services have been provided, i.e., when they have been carried out. Revenue from ongoing services is recognised on an accruals basis. Costs and charges are stated net of returns, allowances, discounts and premiums, as well as taxes directly related to the sale of goods or provision of services, in compliance with the accruals, prudence and revenuematching principles, in the related captions as required by OIC 12.

A tax asset is recognised for payments on account, withholdings and receivables exceeding the taxes payable. Tax receivables and payables are measured at amortised cost, except when they are due within one year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised when the temporary differences arise and are calculated at the tax rates that will be applicable in the year in which the temporary differences reverse, if they have already been established at the reporting date, otherwise at the enacted tax rates at the reporting date. The deferred tax assets on deductible temporary differences and on the benefit connected with the carry forward of tax losses are recognised and maintained only when their future recoverability is reasonably certain, through the availability of future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets may be used or the availability of sufficient taxable temporary differences to recover them in the years in which they reverse.",N/A,as_expected,2021,612

The post-balance sheet events that modify situations existing at the reporting date but do not require adjustments to the carrying amounts under the relevant accounting policy as they relate to the subsequent year are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes if necessary to give a more complete view of the company’s position.

Other information With respect to article 2427.22-quater of the Italian Civil Code, the company notes that no significant events took place after the reporting date that would have had a significant effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Covid-19 broke out in the first half of 2020 and this pandemic situation has not yet been resolved. The company has complied with the Italian national and local guidelines and instructions and promptly took action to manage the emergency. It introduced a number of measures throughout its organisation (especially, remote work) to prevent risks and ensure the health and safety of its employees, customers and suppliers and to be able to continue to operate. As the company sells essential items, it was allowed by the laws of the individual regions where it has its stores to keep them open. With respect to the pandemic’s effects on its business, during the year, the company: - saw a large reduction in certain costs, especially those related to travel and entertainment (-48.7% on 2019), vehicles (-18.3% on 2019), flyers and advertising campaigns during the lockdown (-€400 thousand compared to the budget). However, it incurred costs of approximately €167 thousand to purchase personal protective equipment (PPE). Its lease costs with many lessors decreased temporarily (approximately -€247 thousand. - more than compensated the negative impact of the smaller revenues earned during the early months of the lockdown by the rise in sales in subsequent months.
