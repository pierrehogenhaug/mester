#### % Senior Notes due 2022

**The Company:**

- We are one of the world’s largest producers of beverages on behalf of retailers, brand owners and distributors. Our
product lines include carbonated soft drinks, 100% shelf stable juice and juice-based products, clear, still and sparkling
flavored waters, energy drinks and shots, sports drinks, new age beverages and ready-to-drink teas, as well as beverage
concentrates, liquid enhancers, freezables and ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages. The recent Aimia Foods Acquisition (as
defined below) allowed us to further improve our product, package and channel diversification, by expanding our product
line to include hot chocolate, coffee, malt drinks, creamers/whiteners and cereals, and by providing us with new packaging
formats, which include pouches, jars, sticks, in-cup products, sachets and block-bottom bags.
**The Offering:**

- Use of Proceeds: We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase any and all of our outstanding 8.125%
Senior Notes due 2018, to repay any outstanding loans under our asset-based lending credit facility entered into on March
31, 2008, as amended (the “ABL Facility”), to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.

- Registration Rights: We have agreed to exchange the notes for a new issue of substantially identical registered notes under
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
**The Senior Notes:**

- Maturity: The notes will mature on, 2022.

- Interest Payments: The notes will pay interest semi-annually in cash in arrears on and of each year,
beginning on, 2014.

- Guarantees: The notes will be initially guaranteed on a senior basis by Cott Corporation and all of our subsidiaries that
guarantee indebtedness under our ABL Facility and by any wholly owned subsidiary that guarantees certain indebtedness
of Cott Corporation or any of the other guarantors.

- Ranking: The notes and the guarantees will be our general unsecured senior obligations, will rank equally in right of
payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our
existing and future unsecured subordinated debt. In addition, the notes will be effectively subordinated to all of our and
our guarantors’ secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and effectively
subordinated to the indebtedness and obligations of our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes.

- Optional Redemption: The notes will be redeemable at any time on or after, 2017 at the redemption prices
specified under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
redemption. Prior to, 2017, we may redeem all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount plus a “make-whole” premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In
addition, we may redeem up to 40% of the notes before, 2017, with the net cash proceeds from certain equity
offerings plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.

ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE

**Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**

In addition to historical information, this offering memorandum and the documents incorporated by
reference herein may contain information and statements relating to future events and future results. This
information and these statements are “forward-looking” within the meaning of securities laws, including the
“safe harbor” provisions of the Securities Act (Ontario), the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act,” and
Section 27A of the Securities Act and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, future expectations and
other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such
statements include, but are not limited to, statements that relate to projections of sales, earnings, earnings per
share, cash flows, capital expenditures or other financial items, discussions of estimated future revenue
enhancements and cost savings. These statements also relate to our business strategy, goals and expectations
concerning our market position, future operations, margins, profitability, liquidity and capital resources.
Generally, words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “endeavor,” “estimate,” “expect,”
“intend,” “may,” “will,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “should” and similar terms and phrases are used to identify
forward-looking statements in this offering memorandum and in the documents incorporated by reference herein.
These forward-looking statements reflect current expectations regarding future events and operating performance
and are made only as of the date of this offering memorandum.

The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and, by their nature,
are based on certain estimates and assumptions regarding interest and foreign exchange rates, expected growth,
results of operations, performance, business prospects and opportunities and effective income tax rates, which are
subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Material factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing a
conclusion or making an estimate set out in forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to,
assumptions regarding management’s current plans and estimates, our ability to remain a low cost supplier, and
effective management of commodity costs. Although we believe the assumptions underlying these forwardlooking statements are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, as a result, the
forward-looking statements based on those assumptions could prove to be incorrect. Our operations involve risks
and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and any one or any combination of these risks and
uncertainties could also affect whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. These risks
and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the section entitled “Risk Factors.”

iii


-----

We caution the reader that the risk factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” may not be
exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time
to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk
factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update
or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new
information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Undue reliance should not be placed on
forward-looking statements.

**NOTICE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE RESIDENTS**

###### NEITHER THE FACT THAT A REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR AN APPLICATION FOR A LICENSE HAS BEEN FILED UNDER CHAPTER 421-B (“CHAPTER 421-B”) OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE REVISED STATUTES WITH THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE NOR THE FACT THAT A SECURITY IS EFFECTIVELY REGISTERED OR A PERSON IS LICENSED IN THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE CONSTITUTES A FINDING BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT ANY DOCUMENT FILED UNDER CHAPTER 421-B IS TRUE, COMPLETE AND NOT MISLEADING. NEITHER ANY SUCH FACT NOR THE FACT THAT AN EXEMPTION OR EXCEPTION IS AVAILABLE FOR A SECURITY OR A TRANSACTION MEANS THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS PASSED IN ANY WAY UPON THE MERITS OR QUALIFICATIONS OF, OR RECOMMENDED OR GIVEN APPROVAL TO, ANY PERSON, SECURITY OR TRANSACTION. IT IS UNLAWFUL TO MAKE, OR CAUSE TO BE MADE, TO ANY PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER, CUSTOMER OR CLIENT ANY REPRESENTATION INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH.

**Securities and Exchange Commission Review**

The information in this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration under
the Securities Act. We will agree to file one or more registration statements with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or the “SEC,” with respect to (1) a registered offer to exchange the notes for new exchange notes
having terms substantially identical in all material respects to the notes exchanged therefor (except that the new
exchange notes will not contain terms with respect to additional interest or transfer restrictions) or (2) resales of the
notes. See “Exchange Offer; Registration Rights.” In the course of the review by the SEC of any such registration
statement and other filings we may make with the SEC, we may be required or may elect to make changes to the
description of our business, financial statements and other information in those documents and filings. We believe
that our financial statements and other financial data included or incorporated by reference herein have been
prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with the regulations published by the SEC and are
consistent with current practice, with the exception of the presentation of our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.
Comments by the SEC on our financial data in a registration statement for an exchange offer required by the
registration rights agreement may require modification or reformulation of the data we present in this offering
memorandum, including the financial statements and other financial information. For example, while we believe
that certain of the historical financial data included in this offering memorandum has been prepared in a manner that
complies with published SEC regulations and is consistent with current practice, we could be required by the SEC
to modify or reformulate such presentations. In addition, such registration statement will include historical financial
statements and pro forma financial information related to the Aimia Foods Acquisition (as defined below), which is
omitted from this offering memorandum. Any such modification or reformulation, whether in the pro forma data or
otherwise, may be significant.

-----

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

This offering memorandum and the documents incorporated herein contain “non-GAAP financial
measures,” that is, financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in
the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, or “GAAP.” Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP measures “EBITDA,” “Adjusted
EBITDA,” “adjusted net income” and “free cash flow.”

We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, non-controlling interests,
depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for items which are not
considered by management to be indicative of the underlying results. We define adjusted net income as GAAP
earnings (loss) excluding purchase accounting adjustments, integration expenses, restructuring expenses and
asset impairments. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities determined in
accordance with GAAP excluding capital expenditures.

Management understands that some industry analysts and investors consider EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow as supplementary non-GAAP financial measures useful in
analyzing a company’s performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow,
however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to,
or more meaningful than, net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating,
investing or financing activities as measures of liquidity on an actual or pro forma basis. Since EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow are not measures determined in accordance with
GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
adjusted net income and free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow do not represent an amount of
funds that is available for management’s discretionary use. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, is included
because management believes it is pertinent to the daily management of operations, and management uses this
financial measure to evaluate the impact of operational business decisions.

Each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow has limitations as an
analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of,
our financial information reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

      - they do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures or future contractual commitments;

      - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;

      - they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest, or
principal payments, on indebtedness;

      - they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;

      - they do not reflect available liquidity to our company; and

      - other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use such measures or may
calculate such measures differently than as presented in this offering memorandum, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, none of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash
flow or any related ratio using such measures should be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available
to invest in business growth or reduce indebtedness.

v


-----

Certain adjustments to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow are not in
accordance with regulations adopted by the SEC that apply to registration statements filed under the Securities
Act and periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act, with respect to the use and presentation of non-GAAP
measures. Accordingly, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow may not be
presented in filings made with the SEC, or may not be presented in the same manner as in this offering
memorandum. For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net (loss) income to net (loss)
income attributable to the Company and free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, see
the section entitled “Summary Financial Data.”

**Market And Industry Data**

This offering memorandum includes or incorporates by reference market share and industry data and
forecasts that we have obtained from market research, consultant surveys, publicly available information and
industry publications and surveys, provided by such consultants as The Nielsen Company (UK) (“Nielsen”).
Industry surveys, publications, consultant surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained
therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but there can be no assurance as to the accuracy
and completeness of such information. We have not independently verified any of the data from third-party
sources nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. Additionally, we have
supplemented third-party information where necessary with management estimates based on our review of
internal surveys, information from our customers and vendors, trade and business organizations and other
contacts in markets in which we operate, and our management’s knowledge and experience. However, these
estimates are subject to change and are uncertain due to limits on the availability and reliability of primary
sources of information and the voluntary nature of the data gathering process. As a result, you should be aware
that industry data included or incorporated by reference herein, and estimates and beliefs based on that data, may
not be reliable. Neither we nor the initial purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness
of such information.

**Trademarks And Trade Names**

We own, have rights or will own or acquire rights to trademarks, service marks, copyrights and trade
names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business, including Cott[®] and Red Rain[®] in the
United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, Stars & Stripes[®], Vess[®], Vintage[®], So Clear[®], Shanstar[®],

Moreover, we are licensed to use certain trademarks such as Old Jamaica Ginger Beer[™] and Ting[™] in the
United Kingdom. This offering memorandum also includes trademarks, service marks and trade names of other
companies. Each trademark, service mark or trade name of any other company appearing in this offering
memorandum belongs to its holder. Unless otherwise indicated, use or display by us of other parties’ trademarks,
service marks or trade names is not intended to and does not imply a relationship with, or endorsement or
sponsorship by us of the trademark, service mark or trade name owner.

**INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS**

We are “incorporating by reference” into this offering memorandum certain information we file with the
SEC, which means that we are disclosing important information to you by referring you to those documents. The

We have a diversified product portfolio across major beverage categories with an expanding presence in
beverages that are on-trend with consumer demand. Since 2009, we have invested in developing new products
and completed four acquisitions to enhance the breadth of our product focus and to continue to diversify our
revenues. Consequently, CSDs have declined from 60% of our revenues in 2009 to 36% of our revenues in 2013.
Although we sell the majority of our beverages to customers who own the trademarks associated with the
products, we also utilize several of our own brands such as Red Rain, Stars & Stripes and Red Rooster. In
addition, we own the rights to the Royal Crown mark in various formats in more than 120 countries and
territories outside of North America.

**Competitive Strengths**

We believe that our competitive strengths will enable us to maintain our position as one of the world’s
largest producers of beverages on behalf of retailers, brand owners and distributors, as well as allow us to
capitalize on future opportunities to drive sustainable and profitable growth. Our competitive strengths include:

**_Diverse Product Portfolio_**

We operate an extensive beverage manufacturing plant network with the capability to produce a diverse
product portfolio as outlined below, including on-trend, higher growth beverage categories such as energy drinks
and shots, sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas, ready-to-drink alcohol and liquid enhancers.


**Carbonated soft drinks**
**(natural and preserved)**


**Shelf stable juices and**
**juice- based products**


**New age beverages, clear, still**
**and sparkling flavored waters**


**Energy drinks and shots**


**Sports drinks** **Ready-to-drink teas** **Ready-to-drink alcohol**
**beverages**


**Liquid enhancers, concentrates**
**and dilute-to-taste (DTT)**


Over the last two years, we have made strategic investments to broaden our product scope and enhance
our packaging capabilities. These investments have been focused on higher growth and margin products and
packaging formats, including ready-to-drink teas, ready-to-drink alcohol, energy drinks and shots and liquid
enhancers, as well as packaging investments including pouch, combi cartons, cups and freezable products. The
Aimia Foods Acquisition has further expanded our product line to include hot chocolate, coffee, malt drinks,
creamers/whiteners and cereals, and has provided us with new packaging formats, including jars, sticks, in-cup
products, sachets and block-bottom bags.

**_Extensive, Flexible Manufacturing Capabilities_**

Our business is supported by our extensive manufacturing network and flexible production capabilities.
Our manufacturing footprint encompasses 33 strategically located beverage manufacturing and fruit processing
facilities, including 21 in the United States, four in Canada, seven in the United Kingdom and one in
Mexico. Our United States facility in Columbus, Georgia is also a vertically integrated concentrate facility that
supplies our manufacturing plants and RCI’s global customer base.

packaging designs. Our role includes providing market expertise as well as knowledge of category trends that
may present additional opportunities for our customers.

**_Strong Management Team with Significant Operating Experience_**

We have in place a strong executive team with extensive beverage and consumer goods industry
experience to build on our strengths and to implement our business strategy. Our management team has a proven
track record of successful management with positive operating results, both with us and in previous leadership
roles in the consumer goods and beverage industries.

Our management team is led by Jerry Fowden, our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Fowden has significant
experience in the beverage industry, including leadership positions at AB InBev (formerly known as InBev),
Hero Group AG and PepsiCo. In addition, our management team includes Jay Wells, our Chief Financial Officer.
Mr. Wells has held senior finance positions in both public and private companies, including approximately seven
years at Molson Coors. Steven Kitching was appointed Vice President of Cott’s North America business unit in
March 2013, having previously run our U.K. and European business unit, as well as previous positions at Inbev
and Interbrew.

**Business Strategy**

Our primary goal is to maintain long-term profitability and enhance our position as the market leader
and preferred supplier of beverages on behalf of retailers, brand owners, and distributors in the markets where we
operate as well as in markets outside of those where we have business concentrations today. Continued
leadership in our core markets will enable us to sustain and grow profitability as we drive for increased
penetration and share growth within our core product categories and expand into other beverage markets. We
believe that the following strategies will help us to achieve our goal:

**_4 C’s— Cost Discipline and Focus on Cash Flow Generation_**

_1. Focus on Customer Relationships_

Customer relationships are particularly important for Cott, because many of our products bear our
customers’ brand names. With a continued focus on our customer partnerships, we are able to anticipate our
customers’ needs and deliver high quality products and service at an attractive value that will help them provide
quality, value-oriented products to their consumers. Several of our key customers have long-standing
relationships with the business.

We will continue to focus on our high levels of customer service as a differentiating factor, as well as
innovations through the introduction of new packages, flavors and varieties of beverages. We believe our focus
on our customers will enable us to leverage our existing relationships and to develop new ones in existing and
new markets. As a fast follower of innovative products, our goal is to identify new products that are succeeding
in the marketplace and develop similar products of high quality for our customers to offer their consumers at a
better value.

_2. Continue to Lower Operating Costs_

We understand that our long-term success will be closely tied to our ability to remain a low-cost
supplier. Effective management of our operating costs is critical to our success. On an ongoing basis we review
our fixed overhead and manufacturing costs in an effort to continually improve our operating efficiencies.
Consequently, we target our selling, general and administrative costs to be between approximately 7-8% of

We believe contract manufacturing will be a significant growth opportunity allowing us to continue to
capitalize on outsourcing trends by brand owners. We have entered into contract manufacturing arrangements
across a number of product categories such as juice, juice drinks and teas. Consequently, our North American
contract manufacturing 8 oz equivalent volumes increased over 100% during the first quarter of 2014 relative to
the first quarter of 2013. We believe that over the next three years 30 to 50 million additional raw cases (50 to
80 million 8 oz equivalent cases) of contract manufacturing product is attainable. By expanding our contract
manufacturing business, we will be able to increase our existing asset utilization by improving line efficiency
rates. Additionally contract manufacturing revenues reduce our exposure to commodity volatility and require
lower working capital investments as compared to private label. We also believe foodservice will be a significant
scale opportunity in the future and have dedicated a sales team to pursuing entry into foodservice categories,
channels and products.

To complement and support our diversification initiatives, we have invested in new packaging formats.
In the first quarter of 2014, we installed two pouch fillers and associated pasteurizers at our Dallas-Fort Worth
facility. Additionally, we have installed packaging capabilities for 16 oz and 24 oz cans, liquid enhancers and 3
oz plastic bottles. We continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our capabilities into new package formats.
The following graphics set forth our current packaging formats:

**Shots &** **Soda** **Jubblies &** **Lunchbox**
**PET** **Aluminum** **Enhancers** **Overwraps** **Sports Cap** **Stream** **Freezables** **Carton** **Pouch**

**_Pursue Select Acquisitions_**

We are looking to diversify our business by accelerating the pace and scale of our acquisitions outside
of the areas where we have business concentrations today. In particular, we are pursuing acquisitions outside of
those relating to CSDs and shelf stable juices, with a focus on other beverage categories and beverage
adjacencies, as well as on driving our channel mix beyond large format retail and supermarket stores. We intend
to continue to evaluate and pursue strategic opportunities to enhance our industry position, strengthen our
business and build value for our shareholders. This acquisition strategy will allow us to diversify our revenue
base, increase cross-selling opportunities and further enhance procurement economies of scale. We will continue
to be selective and disciplined in our acquisition strategy by looking for businesses that provide improved growth
and enhanced gross margins, as well as cost synergies. We believe that opportunities exist for us to enhance our
scale, reduce fixed manufacturing costs and broaden our product portfolio.

In May 2014, our U.K. reporting segment acquired 100% of the share capital of Aimia Foods (Holdings)
Limited (“Aimia Foods”), a privately owned business based in Merseyside, United Kingdom (the “Aimia Foods
Acquisition”). See “Recent Developments—Aimia Foods Acquisition.”

In June 2013, our U.K. reporting segment acquired 100% of the share capital of Cooke Bros. Holdings
Limited (the “Calypso Soft Drinks Acquisition”), which includes the subsidiary companies Calypso Soft Drinks
Limited and Mr. Freeze (Europe) Limited (together, “Calypso Soft Drinks”). Calypso Soft Drinks produces fruit
juices, juice drinks, soft drinks, and freeze products in the United Kingdom. The Calypso Soft Drinks Acquisition
provided increased product offerings, logistical synergies and access to an additional production line. The
addition of Calypso Soft Drinks increased our offering of products and packaging with the introduction of combi

cartons, single serve cups and cuplets, and freezable formats and brands. Equally important, the acquisition
provided three new channels: foodservice, education and small convenience stores.

The aggregate purchase price for the Calypso Soft Drinks Acquisition was $12.1 million, which
included approximately $7.0 million paid at closing, deferred payments of approximately $2.3 million and
$3.0 million to be paid on the first and second anniversary of the closing date, respectively, of the Calypso Soft
Drinks Acquisition. In connection with the Calypso Soft Drinks Acquisition, we paid off $18.5 million of
outstanding debt of the acquired companies.

In March 2012, our U.K. reporting segment acquired a beverage and wholesale business based in
Scotland for approximately $5.0 million.

On August 17, 2010, we completed the acquisition (the “Cliffstar Acquisition”) of substantially all of
the assets and liabilities of Cliffstar Corporation (“Cliffstar”) and its affiliated companies pursuant to an Asset
Purchase Agreement dated July 7, 2010 for approximately $503.0 million payable in cash, $14.0 million in
deferred consideration paid over three years and contingent consideration of $34.9 million. Following completion
of the Cliffstar Acquisition, we broadened our product portfolio to include shelf-stable juices such as apple juice,
grape juice, cranberry juice and juice-blends, as well as functional and new age beverages, which allowed us to
penetrate the juice market and further expand our private label offerings.

**Recent Developments**

**_Aimia Foods Acquisition_**

In May 2014, our U.K. reporting segment acquired 100% of the share capital of Aimia Foods. The
purchase price included the payment of approximately $80 million at closing plus an adjustment for working
capital, $33 million in deferred consideration payable in September 2014, and on-target earn-out consideration of
$20 million payable upon the achievement of adjusted EBITDA of approximately $21 million for Aimia Foods’
fiscal year ended June 2016, with a minimum earn-out consideration of $13 million and a maximum earnout
consideration of $27 million. The purchase price was funded through cash on hand and borrowings under our
ABL Facility.

**Exchange Offer; Registration**
**Rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We have agreed to exchange the notes for a new issue of substantially
identical debt securities (except that the new exchange notes will not


12


-----

contain terms with respect to additional interest or transfer
restrictions) registered under the Securities Act as evidence of the
same underlying obligation of indebtedness within 365 days after the
issue date of the notes. We have also agreed to file a shelf registration
statement to cover resales of the notes under certain circumstances. If
we fail to satisfy these obligations, we have agreed to pay liquidated
damages to the holders of the notes under certain circumstances. See
“Exchange Offer; Registration Rights.”

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering, after the initial
purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering fees
and expenses, will be approximately $ million. We intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase or redeem any and
all of the outstanding 2018 Notes, to repay the loans outstanding
under the ABL Facility, to pay related fees and expenses and for
general corporate purposes. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any

subject to, the registration requirements of these securities laws. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**Absence of Established Markets for**
**the Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes are a new issue of securities, and currently there is no
market for the notes. We do not intend to apply for the notes to be
listed on any securities exchange, or to arrange for any quotation
system to quote them. The initial purchasers have advised us that they
intend to make markets for the notes, but they are not obligated to do
so. The initial purchasers may discontinue any market making in the
notes at any time in their sole discretion. See “Plan of Distribution.”
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that liquid markets will develop
for the notes.

**Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** An investment in the notes involves substantial risk. See “Risk
Factors” for a description of certain of the risks you should consider
before investing in the notes.

**RISK FACTORS**

_In considering whether to purchase the notes offered hereby, you should understand the high degree of_
_risk involved. You should carefully consider the risk factors and other information contained in this offering_
_memorandum and the risk factors and other information incorporated by reference under the caption “Item IA._
_Risk Factors” in our Form 10-K, as well as the other information incorporated by reference herein as such risk_
_factors and other information may be updated from time to time by our subsequent reports and other filings_
_under the Exchange Act. See “Where You Can Find More Information” and “Incorporation by Reference of_
_Certain Documents.” The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not_
_currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our_
_business, financial condition or results of operations._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We may be unable to compete successfully in the highly competitive beverage category._**

The markets for our products are extremely competitive. In comparison to the major national brand
beverage manufacturers, we are a relatively small participant in the industry. We face competition from the
national brand beverage manufacturers in all of our markets, from other retailer brand beverage manufacturers
and from other contract beverage manufacturers. If our competitors reduce their selling prices, increase the
frequency of their promotional activities in our core market or enter into the production of private-label products
or expand their contract manufacturing efforts, or if our customers do not allocate adequate shelf space for the
beverages we supply, we could experience a decline in our volumes, be forced to reduce pricing, forgo price
increases required to offset increased costs of raw materials and fuel, increase capital and other expenditures, or
lose market share, any of which could adversely affect our profitability.

**_We may not be able to respond successfully to consumer trends related to our products._**

Consumer trends with respect to the products we sell are subject to change. Consumers are seeking
increased variety in their beverages, and there is a growing interest among consumers, public health officials and
government officials regarding the ingredients in our products, the attributes of those ingredients and health and
wellness issues generally. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and dietary guidelines are encouraging
consumers to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, including those sweetened with HFCS or other
nutritive sweeteners. As a result, consumer demand has declined for full-calorie CSDs and consumer demand has
increased for products associated with health and wellness, such as reduced-calorie CSDs, water, enhanced
water, teas and certain other non-carbonated beverages, including juices. Consumer preferences may change due
to a variety of other factors, including the aging of the general population, changes in social trends, the real or
perceived impact that the manufacturing of our products has on the environment, changes in consumer
demographics, changes in travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns, negative publicity resulting from regulatory
action or litigation against companies in the industry, or a downturn in economic conditions. Any of these
changes may reduce consumers’ demand for our products.

We may not be able to develop or be a “fast follower” of innovative products that respond to consumer
trends. Our failure to develop innovative products could put us at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace
and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.

**_Because a small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our sales, the loss of or_**
**_reduction in sales to any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations_**
**_and financial condition._**

A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated in a small number of customers. Our customers
include many large national and regional grocery, mass-merchandise, drugstore, wholesale and convenience store
chains in our core markets of North America, the U.K. and Mexico, as well as customers for whom we

18


-----

manufacture beverages on a contract basis. Sales to Walmart, our top customer in 2013, 2012 and 2011
accounted for 30.1%, 31.0% and 31.6%, respectively, of our total revenue. Sales to our top ten customers in
2013, 2012 and 2011 accounted for approximately 50.0%, 54.2% and 55.1%, respectively, of our total revenue.
We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high
percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future.

The loss of Walmart or any significant customer, or customers that in the aggregate represent a
significant portion of our revenue, or a material reduction in the amount of business we undertake with any such
customer or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.
Furthermore, we could be adversely affected if Walmart or any significant customer reacts unfavorably to any
pricing of our products or decides to de-emphasize or reduce their product offerings in the categories with which
we supply them. At December 28, 2013, we had $212.0 million of customer relationships recorded as an
intangible asset. The permanent loss of any customer included in the intangible asset would result in impairment
in the value of the intangible asset or accelerated amortization and could lead to an impairment of fixed assets
that were used to service that client.

**_Our ingredients, packaging supplies and other costs are subject to price increases and we may be unable to_**
**_effectively pass rising costs on to our customers._**

We typically bear the risk of changes in prices on the ingredient and packaging in our products. The
majority of our ingredient and packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the prices they charge us
based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce them. Aluminum for cans
and ends, resin for polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) bottles, caps and preforms, corn for HFCS, sugar, fruit
and fruit concentrates are examples of these underlying commodities. In addition, the contracts for certain of our
ingredient and packaging materials permit our suppliers to increase the costs they charge us based on increases in
their cost of converting those underlying commodities into the materials that we purchase. In certain cases those
increases are subject to negotiated limits. These changes in the prices we pay for ingredient and packaging
materials occur at times that vary by product and supplier, and take place, on a monthly, quarterly or annual
basis.

Accordingly, we bear the risk of fluctuations in the costs of these ingredient and packaging materials,
including the underlying costs of the commodities used to manufacture them and, to some extent, the costs of
converting those commodities into the materials we purchase. If the cost of these ingredients or packaging
materials increases, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through adjustments to the
prices we charge. If we cannot pass on these increases to our customers on a timely basis, they could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we are able to pass these costs on to our customers through
price increases, the impact those increased prices could have on our volumes is uncertain.

Our beverage and concentrate production facilities use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas
and other energy sources to operate. Fluctuations in the price of fuel and other energy sources for which we have
not locked in long-term pricing commitments or arrangements would affect our operating costs, which could
impact our profitability.

**_If we fail to manage our operations successfully, our business and financial results may be materially and_**
**_adversely affected._**

In recent years, we have grown our business and beverage offerings primarily through the acquisition of
other companies, development of new product lines and growth with key customers. We believe that
opportunities exist to increase sales of beverages in our markets by leveraging existing customer relationships,
obtaining new customers, exploring new channels of distribution, introducing new products or identifying
appropriate acquisition or strategic alliance candidates. The success of this strategy with respect to acquisitions
depends on our ability to manage and integrate acquisitions (including the Calypso Soft Drinks Acquisition and

19


-----

the Aimia Foods Acquisition) and alliances into our existing business. Furthermore, the businesses or product
lines that we acquire or align with may not be integrated successfully into our business or prove profitable. In
addition to the foregoing factors, our ability to expand our business in foreign countries is also dependent on, and
may be limited by, our ability to comply with the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we may operate, as
well as changes in local government regulations and policies in such jurisdictions. If we fail to manage the
geographic allocation of production capacity surrounding customer demand in North America, we may lose
certain customer product volume or have to utilize co-packers to fulfill our customer capacity obligations, either
of which could negatively impact our financial results.

**_We may devote a significant amount of our management’s attention and resources to our ongoing review of_**
**_strategic opportunities, and we may not be able to fully realize the potential benefit of any such alternatives_**
**_that we pursue._**

As part of our overall strategic planning process, from time to time we evaluate whether there are
alternatives available to complement our strategy of organic growth and growth through diversification, or
otherwise enhance shareholder value. Accordingly, we may from time to time be engaged in evaluating potential
transactions and other strategic alternatives, and we may engage in discussions that may result in one or more
transactions. Although there would be uncertainty that any of these discussions would result in definitive
agreements or the completion of any transaction, we may devote a significant amount of our management’s
attention and resources to evaluating and pursuing a transaction or opportunity, which could negatively impact
our operations. In addition, we may incur significant costs in connection with evaluating and pursuing other
strategic opportunities, regardless of whether any transaction is completed. We cannot assure you that we would
fully realize the potential benefit of any strategic alternative or transaction that we pursue.

**_We may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business and harm our business, operating results or_**
**_financial condition._**

We expect to make selective domestic and international acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses
that offer complementary products, augment our market coverage and/or enhance our capabilities. We may also
enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals. We may not be able to identify suitable
acquisition, investment, alliance or joint venture opportunities or consummate any such transactions or
relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us. Such transactions or relationships that we enter into may
not be successful. In addition, acquisitions and investments outside of the United States involve unique risks
related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular
economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.

These transactions or any other acquisitions or dispositions involve risks and uncertainties, which may
have a material adverse effect on our business. The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and
could result in disruption to other parts of our business. In addition, the integration may require that we incur
significant restructuring charges. To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management
information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the
acquired operations. The difficulties of the integrations may be further complicated by such factors as geographic
distances, lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business,
delays and challenges associated with integrating the business with our existing businesses, diversion of
management’s attention from daily operations of the business, potential loss of key employees and customers of
the acquired business, the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired business, performance
problems with the acquired business’ technology, difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited
direct prior experience, exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business, insufficient revenues to
offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition, and our ability to achieve the growth prospects and
synergies expected from any such acquisition. Even when an acquired business has already developed and
marketed products and services, there can be no assurance that product or service enhancements will be made in
a timely fashion or that all pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise
with respect to such acquired assets.

20


-----

Any acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible
assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges, incur amortization expense
related to certain intangible assets, increase our expenses and working capital requirements, and subject us to
litigation, which would reduce our return on invested capital. Failure to manage and successfully integrate the
acquisitions we make could materially harm our business and operating results.

Any future acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing, which in the case of debt
financing, will increase our leverage and, in the case of equity financing, would be dilutive to our existing
stockholders. Any decline in our perceived credit-worthiness associated with an acquisition could adversely
affect our ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. As a result of the foregoing, we also
may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or
at all. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired
operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our geographic diversity subjects us to the risk of currency fluctuations._**

We conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of
currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in
currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, because our financial statements are
denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies
have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we may enter into financial
transactions to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not
adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, while the use of
currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange
rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable
fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

**_If we are unable to maintain relationships with our raw material suppliers, we may incur higher supply costs_**
**_or be unable to deliver products to our customers._**

In addition to water, the principal raw materials required to produce our products are aluminum cans and
ends, PET bottles, caps and preforms, labels, cartons and trays, sweeteners, such as HFCS and sugar, and fruit
and fruit concentrates. We rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key suppliers to support our operations.

We typically enter into annual or multi-year supply arrangements with our key suppliers, meaning that
our suppliers are obligated to continue to supply us with materials for one-year or multi-year periods, at the end
of which we must either renegotiate the contracts with those suppliers or find alternative sources for supply.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to either renegotiate contracts (with similar or more
favorable terms) with these suppliers when they expire or, alternatively, if we are unable to renegotiate contracts
with our key suppliers, there can be no assurance that we could replace them. We could also incur higher
ingredient and packaging supply costs in renegotiating contracts with existing suppliers or replacing those
suppliers, or we could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, either
of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

With respect to some of our key packaging supplies, such as aluminum cans and ends, and some of our
key ingredients, such as sweeteners, we have entered into long-term supply agreements, the remaining terms of
which range from 12 to 36 months, and therefore we expect to have a supply of those key packaging supplies and
ingredients during such terms. In addition, the supply of specific ingredient and packaging materials could be
adversely affected by many factors, including industry consolidation, energy shortages, governmental controls,
labor disputes, natural disasters, transportation interruption, political instability, acts of war or terrorism and
other factors.

**_We have a significant amount of outstanding debt, which could adversely affect our financial health and_**
**_future cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations._**

As of March 29, 2014, after giving effect to this offering and the application of net proceeds therefrom
for the repurchase of any and all of the outstanding 2018 Notes and the repayment of borrowings outstanding
under the ABL Facility, our total indebtedness would have been $552.6 million. Our present indebtedness and
any future borrowings could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:

      - requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this
debt;

      - making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;

      - increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which would increase future
debt costs;

      - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

      - reducing the cash flow available for share repurchases, to pay dividends, and to fund capital
expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;

      - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;

      - placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged as
we are; and

      - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business
opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.

To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. In addition, our
actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. We cannot assure you that our business will
generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts
sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from future operations to meet our debt service obligations,
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to refinance any of our debt on attractive terms, commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot
service or refinance our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional
equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of
which could impede the implementation of our business strategy, prevent us from entering into transactions that
would otherwise benefit our business and/or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations. Our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance our debt will be subject to
future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

**_Despite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt._**
**_This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage._**

We will have the right to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the
agreements governing our indebtedness restrict, but do not in all circumstances, prohibit us from doing so. All
existing and future borrowings under the ABL Facility will rank pari passu with the notes and the subsidiary
guarantees and such borrowings will be secured by substantially all of our assets. Under the instruments
governing our debt, we may incur substantial additional debt that ranks equal with the notes. In addition, the

22


-----

indenture governing the notes would permit us to incur additional indebtedness under certain incurrence baskets
without having to meet coverage ratio incurrence tests or other EBITDA thresholds. Under certain debt
incurrence tests, the amount of total debt we could incur in the future under the indenture governing the notes
could increase.

Any additional debt may be governed by indentures or other instruments containing covenants that
could place restrictions on the operation of our business and the execution of our business strategy in addition to
the restrictions on our business already contained in the agreements governing our existing debt. Because any
decision to issue debt securities or enter into new debt facilities will depend on market conditions and other
factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future debt
financings and we may be required to accept unfavorable terms for any such financings.

**_Our ABL Facility contains, and the indenture governing the notes offered in this offering will contain, various_**
**_covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business, which could prevent us from_**
**_capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions._**

Our ABL Facility imposes, and the indenture governing the notes offered in this offering will impose,
significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit or restrict, among other things,
our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

      - incur additional indebtedness;

      - make restricted payments (including paying dividends on, redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our
capital stock);

      - make investments;

      - create liens;

      - sell assets;

      - enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, make loans or transfer
assets to us;

      - engage in transactions with affiliates; and

      - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications and, with respect to the notes, are
described under the heading “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants” in this offering memorandum. In
addition, our ABL Facility also requires us, under certain circumstances, to maintain compliance with certain
financial covenants. Our ability to comply with this covenant may be affected by events beyond our control,
including those described in this “Risk Factors” section. A breach of any of the covenants contained in our ABL
Facility, including our inability to comply with the financial covenant, could result in an event of default, which
would allow the lenders under our ABL Facility to declare all borrowings outstanding to be due and payable,
which would in turn trigger an event of default under the indenture governing the notes and, potentially, our other
indebtedness. At maturity or in the event of an acceleration of payment obligations, we would likely be unable to
pay our outstanding indebtedness with our cash and cash equivalents then on hand. We would, therefore, be
required to seek alternative sources of funding, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,
terms as favorable as our current agreements or at all, or face bankruptcy. If we are unable to refinance our
indebtedness or find alternative means of financing our operations, we may be required to curtail our operations,
face bankruptcy, or take other actions that are inconsistent with our current business practices or strategy.

23


-----

**_A portion of our debt may be variable rate debt, and changes in interest rates could adversely affect us by_**
**_causing us to incur higher interest costs with respect to such variable rate debt._**

Our ABL Facility subjects us to interest rate risk. The rate at which we pay interest on amounts
borrowed under such facility fluctuates with changes in interest rates and our debt leverage. Accordingly, with
respect to any amounts from time to time outstanding under our ABL Facility, we are and will be exposed to
changes in interest rates. If we are unable to adequately manage our debt structure in response to changes in the
market, our interest expense could increase, which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of
operations. The outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility as of March 29, 2014 were $130.9 million. A
1% increase in interest rates would result in increased interest expense of $1.3 million on the current outstanding
borrowings under our ABL Facility. If the full ABL Facility was outstanding, a 1.0% increase in the interest rate
would result in interest expense of $3.0 million.

**_Our financial results may be negatively impacted by global financial events._**

In recent years, global financial events have resulted in the consolidation, failure or near failure of a
number of institutions in the banking, insurance and investment banking industries and have substantially
reduced the ability of companies to obtain financing. These events also adversely affected the financial markets.
These events could continue to have a number of different effects on our business, including:

      - a reduction in consumer spending, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume;

      - a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us or our vendors
to timely supply materials, thus reducing our cash flow;

      - an increase in counterparty risk;

      - an increased likelihood that one or more members of our banking syndicate may be unable to honor
its commitments under our ABL Facility; and

      - restricted access to capital markets that may limit our ability to take advantage of business
opportunities, such as acquisitions.

Other events or conditions may arise or persist directly or indirectly from the global financial events that
could negatively impact our business.

**_We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring_**
**_activities._**

We have in the past implemented, and may in the future implement, restructuring activities to support
the implementation of key strategic initiatives designed to achieve long-term sustainable growth. These activities
are intended to maximize our operating effectiveness and efficiency and to reduce our costs. We cannot be
assured that we will achieve or sustain the targeted benefits under these programs or that the benefits, even if
achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth expectations. In addition, the implementation of key
elements of these activities, may have an adverse impact on our business, particularly in the near-term.

**_Substantial disruption to production at our beverage concentrates or other beverage production facilities could_**
**_occur._**

A disruption in production at our beverage concentrates production facility, which manufactures almost
all of our concentrates, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a disruption could occur
at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers, bottlers or distributors. The disruption could occur for
many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation
interruption, government regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities
may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of
which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.

24


-----

**_Our success depends, in part, on our intellectual property, which we may be unable to protect._**

We possess certain intellectual property that is important to our business. This intellectual property
includes trade secrets, in the form of the concentrate formulas for most of the beverages that we produce, and
trademarks for the names of the beverages that we sell. While we own certain of the trademarks used to identify
our beverages, other trademarks are used through licenses from third parties or by permission from our
customers. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property.

To protect this intellectual property, we rely principally on registration of trademarks, contractual
responsibilities and restrictions in agreements (such as indemnification, nondisclosure and confidentiality
agreements) with employees, consultants and customers, and on common law and statutory protections afforded
to trademarks, trade secrets and proprietary “know-how.” In addition, we vigorously protect our intellectual
property against infringements using any and all legal remedies available. Notwithstanding our efforts, we may
not be successful in protecting our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including:

      - our competitors may independently develop intellectual property that is similar to or better than
ours;

      - employees, consultants or customers may not abide by their contractual agreements and the cost of
enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive, or those agreements may prove to be unenforceable
or more limited than anticipated;

      - foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights; and

      - our intellectual property rights may be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitive position would weaken and we
could face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. At March 29, 2014, we had
$45.0 million of Rights (as defined below) and $6.9 million of trademarks recorded as intangible assets.

Occasionally, third parties may assert that we are, or may be, infringing on or misappropriating their
intellectual property rights. In these cases, we intend to defend against claims or negotiate licenses when we
consider these actions appropriate. Intellectual property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and
factual questions. If we become involved in this type of litigation, it could consume significant resources and
divert our attention from business operations.

If we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, we could incur significant
damages, be enjoined from continuing to manufacture, market or use the affected product, or be required to
obtain a license to continue manufacturing or using the affected product. A license could be very expensive to
obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of
others may be costly or impracticable.

**_Our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated and we could be liable_**
**_for injury, illness or death caused by consumption of our products._**

We have adopted various quality, environmental, health and safety standards. However, our products
may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated. A failure to meet these standards or
contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, distributors or suppliers. This could result in
expensive production interruptions, recalls and liability claims. We may be liable to our customers if the
consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. Moreover, negative publicity could be
generated from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. Any of these failures or
occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.

25


-----

**_Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation._**

We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We evaluate these claims and
proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential
losses. We may establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our
accounting policies. We base our assessments, estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the
time and rely on legal and management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from
assessments and estimates. Actual settlements, judgments or resolutions of these claims or proceedings may
negatively affect our business and financial performance.

**_Changes in the legal and regulatory environment in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our_**
**_costs or reduce our revenues, adversely affect demand for our products or result in litigation._**

As a producer of beverages, we must comply with various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign
laws relating to production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution, including, in the United States, those of
the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Federal Trade Commission
Act, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and California Proposition 65. We are also subject to various
federal, state, provincial, local and foreign environmental laws and workplace regulations. These laws and
regulations include, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Unfair Labor Standards
Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act, laws
governing equal employment opportunity, customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, laws relating to the
maintenance of fuel storage tanks, laws relating to water consumption and treatment, and various other federal
statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations may change as a result of political, economic, or social
events. Such regulatory changes may include changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising,
accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws and environmental laws, including laws relating to
the regulation of water rights and treatment. Changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related
interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business, which may impact our results or increase our
costs or liabilities.

A number of states have passed laws setting forth warning or labeling requirements relating to products
made for human consumption. For example, the California law known as Proposition 65 requires that a specific
warning appear on any product sold in California containing a substance listed by that state as having been found
to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. This law, and others like it, exposes all food and beverage producers to
the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. The detection of even a trace amount of a listed
substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label, although products containing
listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply
are generally exempt from the warning requirement. From time to time over the past several years, certain of our
customers have received notices alleging that the labeling requirements of the relevant state regulation would
apply to products manufactured by us and sold by them. There can be no assurance that we will not be adversely
affected by actions against our customers or us relating to Proposition 65 or similar “failure to warn” laws: were
any such claim to be pursued or succeed, we might in some cases be required to indemnify our customers for
damages, and our products might be required to bear warning labels in order to be sold in certain states. Any
negative media attention, adverse publicity or action arising from allegations of violations could adversely
impact consumer perceptions of our products and harm our business.

**_Taxes on CSDs and other drinks could have an adverse effect on our business._**

Federal, state, local and foreign governments have considered or have enacted taxes on soda and other
sugary drinks, as well as energy products. Any such taxes could negatively impact consumer demand for our
products and have an adverse effect on our revenues.

26


-----

**_We are not in compliance with the requirements of the Ontario Environmental Protection Act (“OEPA”) and,_**
**_if the Ontario government seeks to enforce those requirements or implements modifications to them, we could_**
**_be adversely affected._**

Certain regulations under the OEPA provide that a minimum percentage of a bottler’s soft drink sales
within specified areas in Ontario must be made in refillable containers. The penalty for non-compliance is a fine
of $50,000 per day beginning when the first offense occurs and continuing until the first conviction, and then
increasing to $100,000 per day for each subsequent conviction. These fines may be increased to equal the amount
of monetary benefit acquired by the offender as a result of the commission of the offense. We, and we believe
other industry participants, are currently not in compliance with the requirements of the OEPA. We do not expect
to be in compliance with these regulations in the foreseeable future. Ontario is not enforcing the OEPA at this
time, but if it chose to enforce the OEPA in the future, we could incur fines for non-compliance and the possible
prohibition of sales of soft drinks in non-refillable containers in Ontario. We estimate that approximately 3% of
our Canada operating segment sales would be affected by the possible limitation on sales of soft drinks in nonrefillable containers in Ontario if the Ontario Ministry of the Environment initiated an action to enforce the
provisions of the OEPA.

**_Adverse weather conditions could affect our supply chain and reduce the demand for our product._**

Severe weather conditions and natural disasters, such as freezes, frosts, floods, hurricanes, tornados,
droughts or earthquakes and crop diseases may affect our facilities and our supply of raw materials such as fruit.
If the supply of any of our raw materials is adversely affected by weather conditions, it may result in increased
raw material costs and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient supplies from other
sources. In addition, the sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets
in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may reduce the demand for our
products and contribute to lower revenues, which could negatively impact our profitability.

**_Global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and financial results._**

Our business can be affected by large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the United
States or other major industrialized countries in which we do business, major natural disasters, or widespread
outbreaks of infectious diseases. Such events could impair our ability to manage our business, could disrupt our
supply of raw materials, and could impact production, transportation and delivery of products. In addition, such
events could cause disruption of regional or global economic activity, which can affect consumers’ purchasing
power in the affected areas and, therefore, reduce demand for our products.

**_Our success depends in part upon our ability to recruit, retain and prepare succession plans for our CEO,_**
**_CFO, senior management and key employees._**

The performance of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), senior
management and other key employees is critical to our success. We plan to continue to invest time and resources
in developing our senior management and key employee teams. Our long-term success will depend on our ability
to recruit and retain capable senior management and other key employees, and any failure to do so could have a
material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition. Further, if we fail to adequately
plan for the succession of our CEO, CFO, senior management and other key employees, our operating results
could be adversely affected.

**_Changes in future business conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill, indefinite_**
**_life intangible assets or other intangible assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-_**
**_downs that would negatively impact our results of operations._**

As part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time, make investments in other businesses. These
investments are made upon careful target analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired
return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining

27


-----

investment amount or acquisition price. After acquisition or investment, unforeseen issues could arise that
adversely affect anticipated returns or that are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price.
Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates.

Goodwill accounted for approximately $136.5 million of our recorded total assets as of March 29, 2014.
We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment
exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment and certain underlying
assumptions. Our only intangible asset with an indefinite life relates to the 2001 acquisition of intellectual
property from Royal Crown Company, Inc., including the right to manufacture our concentrates, with all related
inventions, processes, technologies, technical and manufacturing information, know-how and the use of the
Royal Crown brand outside of North America and Mexico (the “Rights”). This asset, which has a net book value
of $45.0 million, is more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our
Form 10-K.

As of March 29, 2014, intangible and other assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $247.1
million, which consisted principally of $205.9 million of customer relationships that arose from acquisitions,
$9.3 million of financing costs, $20.9 million of information technology assets, and trademarks of $6.9 million.
Customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis for the period over which we expect to receive
economic benefits, which is up to 15 years. We review the estimated useful life of these intangible assets
annually, taking into consideration the specific net cash flows related to the intangible asset, unless it is required
more frequently due to a triggering event such as the loss of a customer. The permanent loss of any customer
included in the intangible asset would result in impairment in the value of the intangible asset or accelerated
amortization and could lead to an impairment of fixed assets that were used to service that client. Principally, a
decrease in expected reporting segment cash flows, changes in market conditions, loss of key customers and a
change in our imputed cost of capital may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or the Rights. For
additional information on accounting policies we have in place for goodwill impairment, see our discussion
under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Form 10-K and Note 1, “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K.

**_We may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or we could experience_**
**_strikes._**

As of March 29, 2014, 788 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements in the
United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico. These agreements typically expire every three to five
years at various dates. We may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms
or at all. This could result in strikes or work stoppages, which could impair our ability to manufacture and
distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales. The terms of existing or renewed agreements
could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency.

**_We depend on key information systems and third-party service providers._**

We depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business, provide
information to management and prepare financial reports. We have typically relied on third-party providers for
the majority of our key information systems and business processing services, including hosting our primary data
center. In particular, we are in the process of implementing a new SAP software platform to assist us in the
management of our business and have also reorganized certain processes within our finance and accounting
departments. As a part of the reorganization, we have outsourced certain back office transactional finance
processes. If we fail to successfully implement these projects or if the projects do not result in increased
operational efficiencies, our operations may be disrupted and our operating expenses could increase, which could
adversely affect our financial results. In addition, these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or
other failures resulting from, among other things, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, software, equipment or

28


-----

telecommunications failures, processing errors, computer viruses, hackers, other security issues or supplier
defaults. Security, backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid
such disruptions or failures. Any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors,
processing inefficiencies, security breaches, inability to use the systems or process transactions, loss of customers
or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.

**_We also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition,_**
**_which include:_**

      - any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting
principles or otherwise;

      - any event that could damage our reputation;

      - failure of our processes to prevent and detect unethical conduct of employees;

      - a significant failure of internal controls over financial reporting;

      - failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies
and regulatory requirements; and

      - failure of corporate governance policies and procedures.

**Risks Related to the Aimia Foods Acquisition**

**_We may not realize the expected benefits of the Aimia Foods Acquisition because of integration difficulties_**
**_and other challenges._**

The success of the Aimia Foods Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of
the anticipated benefits from integrating Aimia Foods’ business with our existing businesses. The integration
process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the operations of Aimia
Foods’ business include, among others:

      - failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;

      - unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other
systems;

      - possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and compensation
structures between Aimia Foods’ structure and our structure;

      - failure to retain key customers and suppliers;

      - unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;

      - failure to retain key employees;

      - operating risks inherent in Aimia Foods’ business and our business; and

      - unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.

We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of Cott
and Aimia Foods had achieved or might achieve separately. In addition, we may not accomplish the integration

29


-----

of Aimia Foods’ business smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe. If we experience
difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Aimia Foods Acquisition may not be
realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.

**_We face risks associated with our Purchase Agreement in connection with the Aimia Foods Acquisition._**

In connection with the Aimia Foods Acquisition, we will be subject to all of the liabilities of Aimia
Foods that were not satisfied on or prior to the closing date. There may be liabilities that we underestimated or
did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of Aimia Foods. Under the Share
Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 30, 2014 (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among Robert Unsworth
and others, Cott Ventures Limited, Cott Corporation and Cott Beverages Limited, the sellers have agreed to
provide us with a limited set of warranties and indemnities in relation to identified risks. Our sole remedy from
the sellers for any breach of those warranties is an action for damages for a warranty claim. Damages resulting
from a breach of warranty or indemnity could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations.

**_As a private company, Aimia Foods may not have had in place an adequate system of internal control over_**
**_financial reporting that we will need to manage that business effectively as part of a public company._**

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we acquired the entire issued share capital of Aimia Foods
Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries. None of these companies have previously been subject to periodic
reporting as a public company. There can be no assurance that Aimia Foods had in place an effective system of
internal control over financial reporting similar to that which is required for public companies. Establishing,
testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant
resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance and accounting staff, may
require additional staffing and infrastructure investments, and would increase our costs of doing business.
Moreover, if we discover aspects of Aimia Foods’ internal controls that need improvement, we cannot be certain
that our remedial measures will be effective. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or
difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or increase our risk of material
weaknesses in internal controls.

**Risks Related To This Offering**

**_Your right to receive payments on the notes and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to our secured_**
**_debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing that debt._**

The notes and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to claims of existing and future secured
creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such claims. Assuming we had completed this offering
on March 29, 2014, we estimate that we would have had approximately $27.6 million of secured borrowings
outstanding, which excludes outstanding letters of credit but would have included $10.9 million outstanding
under the ABL Facility. The indenture governing the notes will permit us to incur additional secured
indebtedness. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, bankruptcy or any similar proceeding,
holders of our secured obligations will have claims that are prior to claims of the holders of the notes or the
guarantees with respect to the assets securing those obligations, which are substantially all of our assets.
Accordingly, there may not be sufficient funds remaining to pay amounts due on all or any of the notes.

**_Your right to receive payments on the notes could be adversely affected if any of our non-guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries declares bankruptcy, liquidates or reorganizes._**

Some, but not all, of our subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation
or reorganization of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt and their trade creditors will
generally be entitled to payment of their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made

30


-----

available for distribution to us. Assuming we had completed this offering on March 29, 2014, after giving effect
to the guarantee of the notes by our subsidiary guarantors, the notes would have been structurally subordinated to
approximately $11.5 million of debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of these non-guarantor
subsidiaries. The non-guarantor subsidiaries generated approximately 7.0% and 6.8% of our consolidated
revenues for the twelve months ended December 28, 2013 and three months ended March 29, 2014, respectively,
and held approximately 6.2% of our consolidated assets as of March 29, 2014.

**_Certain of our subsidiaries will be classified as unrestricted subsidiaries and will not be subject to any of the_**
**_covenants in the indenture governing the notes, and we may not be able to rely on the cash flow or assets of_**
**_those unrestricted subsidiaries to pay our indebtedness._**

Unrestricted subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants under the indenture governing the notes.
Unrestricted subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that limit their ability to make loans or other
payments to fund payments in respect of the notes. Accordingly, we may not be able to rely on the cash flow or
assets of unrestricted subsidiaries to pay any of our indebtedness, including the notes. The unrestricted
subsidiaries had assets of approximately $24.9 million as of March 29, 2014, and revenues of approximately
$119.4 million for the year ended December 28, 2013 and $27.3 million for the three months ended March 29,
2014.

**_The trading prices for the notes will be directly affected by many factors, including our credit rating._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow, including us. Any
ratings downgrade could adversely affect the trading price of the notes, or the trading market for the notes, to the
extent a trading market for the notes develops. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing
interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future and any fluctuation may impact
the trading price of the notes.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer if required by the_**
**_indenture for the notes or the terms of our other indebtedness._**

Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, we will be required to offer to purchase all
outstanding notes and other outstanding debt. A change of control event under the indenture governing the notes
could also constitute a change of control under the ABL Facility, which could result in the acceleration of the
indebtedness outstanding thereunder. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions and
provisions. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to pay
the purchase price for all the notes tendered by the holders or such other indebtedness and under the indenture
governing the notes we may not be permitted to repurchase such other indebtedness, which could result in an
event of default under such indebtedness. Moreover, under the indenture governing the notes, certain important
corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not
constitute a “change of control” and thus would not give rise to any repurchase rights.

Thus, there can be no assurance that in the event of a change of control we will have sufficient funds to
satisfy our obligations with respect to any or all of the tendered notes. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at
the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

**_Certain laws may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid guarantees and require note holders to_**
**_return payments received from guarantors._**

Under certain bankruptcy and fraudulent transfer laws, a court could avoid a guarantee or subordinate a
guarantee to all of our other debts or all other debts of a guarantor if, among other things, the guarantor, at the
time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee, received less than reasonably equivalent value or
fair consideration for the incurrence of such indebtedness and:

      - the guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

31


-----

      - the guarantor was engaged in a business or transaction for which our or the guarantor’s remaining
assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

      - the guarantor intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond our or its ability to pay
such debts as they mature.

The indenture governing the notes will limit the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the
maximum amount that such guarantor could incur without risk that its guarantee would be subject to avoidance
as a fraudulent transfer. However, this limitation may not protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer
challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if
necessary, to pay the notes in full when due.

A legal challenge to the obligations under any guarantee on fraudulent conveyance grounds could focus
on any benefits received in exchange for the incurrence of those obligations. We believe that each of our
subsidiaries making a guarantee received reasonably equivalent value for incurring the guarantee, but a court
may disagree with our conclusion or elect to apply a different standard in making its determination. A court
could thus void the obligations under a guarantee, subordinate it to a guarantor’s other debt or take other action
detrimental to the holders of the notes. The measures of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent transfer laws
vary depending on the law applied in the proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred.
Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if:

      - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair saleable value of all of
its assets;

      - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute
and mature; or

      - it cannot pay its debts as they become due.

**_You may only transfer the notes in a transaction registered under, or exempt from the registration_**
**_requirements of, the Securities Act._**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so
registered, may not be re-offered or re-sold except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.” Under the registration
rights agreement applicable to the notes, we will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to
commence an exchange offer to exchange the notes and guarantees within a specified period of time for
equivalent securities under the Securities Act or to register the resale of the notes and guarantees under the
Securities Act. However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in having any such registration
statement declared effective. See “Exchange Offer; Registration Rights.”

**_There is no public market for the notes and we do not know if a market will ever develop or, if a market does_**
**_develop, whether it will be sustained._**

The notes are a new issue of securities and there is no existing trading market for the notes. Although
the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the notes, they have no obligation to
do so and may discontinue making a market at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a
liquid market will develop or continue for the notes, that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or
at the price that you desire. We do not intend to apply for listing or quotation of the notes on any securities
exchange or stock market. The liquidity of any market for the notes will depend on a number of factors,
including:

      - the number of holders of the notes;

32


-----

      - our operating performance and financial condition;

      - the market for similar securities;

      - the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the notes; and

      - prevailing interest rates.

**_The trading price of the notes may be volatile._**

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that any such
disruptions may not adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. The notes may trade at a
discount from the initial offering price of the notes, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for
similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES**

The following table sets forth the unaudited consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the
periods shown:

**Three Months Ended** **Year Ended**


**March 29,**
**2014**


**March 30,**
**2013**


**Dec. 28,**
**2013**


**Dec. 29,**
**2012**


**Dec. 31,**

**Jan. 2,**
**2010**


Ratio of earnings to fixed charges(a) . . . . . . . . (b) 1.0 1.3 1.8 1.6 2.7 2.6

(a) We compute the ratio of earnings to fixed charges by dividing (i) earnings (loss), which consists of net
income from continuing operations before income taxes plus fixed charges and amortization of capitalized
interest less interest capitalized during the period and adjusted for undistributed earnings in equity
investments, by (ii) fixed charges, which consist of interest expense, capitalized interest and the portion of
rental expense under operating leases estimated to be representative of the interest factor.

Ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends requirements are not presented
because there was no outstanding preferred stock in any of the periods indicated.

(b) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was less than 1:1 for the three months ended March 29, 2014. In order
to achieve a ratio of earnings to fixed charges of 1:1, we would have had to generate an additional $4.8
million in pre-tax earnings for the three months ended March 29, 2014.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following is a summary of certain of our indebtedness that is outstanding. To the extent such_
_summary contains descriptions of our ABL Facility, the 2018 Notes, and the indenture governing the 2018 Notes,_
_such descriptions do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to those and_
_related documents, copies of which have been filed with the SEC and which we will provide you upon request._
_See “Where You Can Find More Information” and “Incorporation by Reference of Certain Documents.”_

**ABL Facility**

On March 31, 2008, we entered into our ABL Facility with various lenders led by JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. to provide financing for our operating segments in North America, the U.K. and Mexico. Cott
Corporation, Cott Beverages Inc. and Cott Beverages Limited are borrowers under our ABL Facility. The debt
under our ABL Facility is guaranteed by most of our United States, United Kingdom, Canadian and Mexican
subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and guarantors.

In connection with the Cliffstar Acquisition, we refinanced the ABL Facility on August 17, 2010 to,
among other things, provide for the Cliffstar Acquisition, the issuance of $375.0 million of the 2018 Notes and
the application of net proceeds therefrom, the underwritten public offering of 13,340,000 common shares at a
price of $5.67 per share and the application of net proceeds therefrom and to increase the amount available for
borrowings to $275.0 million.

On July 19, 2012, we amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to
July 19, 2017. We incurred $1.2 million of financing fees in connection with the amendment of the ABL Facility.
This amendment was considered to be a modification of the original agreement under generally accepted
accounting principles.

On October 22, 2013, we amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, (1) provide for an increase
in the lenders’ commitments under the ABL Facility to $300.0 million, as well as to increase the accordion
feature, which permits us to increase the lenders’ commitments under the ABL Facility to $350.0 million, subject
to certain conditions, (2) extend the maturity date to the earliest of (i) October 22, 2018 or (ii) March 1, 2018, if
we have not redeemed, repurchased or refinanced the 2018 Notes by February 15, 2018, and (3) provide for
greater flexibility under certain covenants. We incurred approximately $0.7 million of financing fees in
connection with the amendment of the ABL Facility. This amendment was considered to be a modification of the
original agreement under generally accepted accounting principles.

The financing fees incurred in connection with the refinancing of the ABL Facility on August 17, 2010,
along with the financing fees incurred in connection with the amendments of the ABL Facility on July 19, 2012
and on October 22, 2013, are being amortized using the straight-line method over the duration of the amended
ABL Facility. On May 28, 2014, we amended the ABL Facility to increase our ability to incur unsecured debt
and earnout consideration for permitted acquisitions, as well as to allow us to add additional borrowers and to
designate additional guarantors to be included under the borrowing base.

-----

As of March 29, 2014, we had $130.9 million of outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility. The
commitment fee was 0.375% per annum of the unused commitment, which, taking into account $7.5 million of
letters of credit, was $141.1 million as of March 29, 2014.

In connection with this offering, we intend to repay $120.0 million of the outstanding loans under the
ABL Facility.

**8.125% Senior Notes due 2018**

On August 17, 2010, we issued the 2018 Notes. Most of our United States, Canadian and United
Kingdom subsidiaries guarantee the 2018 Notes. The interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually on
March 1 and September 1 of each year.

We incurred $8.6 million of financing fees in connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes. The
financing fees are being amortized using the effective interest method over an eight-year period, which represents
the term to maturity of the 2018 Notes.

In connection with this offering, we have commenced a tender offer to repurchase all of the outstanding
2018 Notes. In connection with the Tender Offer, we are also seeking to eliminate substantially all of the
restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes through a Consent Solicitation as described in the
Offer to Purchase. However, no assurances can be made that such a Tender Offer will be completed or that we
will be able to repurchase any or all of the outstanding 2018 Notes. If the Tender Offer is not consummated or if
we purchase less than all outstanding 2018 Notes in the Tender Offer, we intend to redeem any outstanding 2018
Notes.

**GE Term Loan**

In January 2008, we entered into a capital lease finance arrangement with General Electric Capital
Corporation (“GE Capital”) for the lease of equipment. In September 2013, we purchased the equipment subject
to the lease for an aggregate purchase price of $10.7 million, with the financing for such purchase provided by
GE Capital at 5.23% interest.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

The following is a description of the % senior notes due 2022 (the “Notes’’). The Notes will be
issued by Cott Beverages, Inc. (the “Issuer”). In this Description of Notes, the term “Issuer” refers to Cott
Beverages, Inc., any successor thereto and any successor obligor to the Issuer on the Notes, and not to any of its
Subsidiaries, and the “Company” refers only to Cott Corporation, and any successor thereto and any successor
obligor to the Company on the Guarantee of the Notes, and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date
among the Issuer, the Guarantors, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and as
paying agent, registrar and transfer agent. The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.’’ The terms of the Notes include
those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The
Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, and Holders of the Notes are
referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. Because this is a summary, it
may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture in its entirety. Copies
of the proposed form of the Indenture are available as described under “Where You Can Find More
Information.’’ You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain
Definitions.’’

**Brief Description of Notes and the Note Guarantees**

The Notes will be:

      - general unsecured senior obligations of the Issuer;

      - _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness (including the_
Credit Agreement) of the Issuer;

      - effectively subordinated to all Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer (including the Credit Agreement)
to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness;

      - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

      - guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each Guarantor; and

      - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock, of Non-Guarantors.

The Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior
unsecured basis by all of the Guarantors. See the section entitled “—Guarantees.’’

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will be:

      - a general unsecured senior obligation of the Guarantor;

      - _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors;_

      - effectively subordinated to all Secured Indebtedness of the Guarantors (including the Credit
Agreement) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness; and

      - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Guarantor.

39


-----

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes
are subject to applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). If the due date for any payment
in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder
thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place,
and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The Notes will be issued in an aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million on the Issue Date. The
Notes will mature on, 2022. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate per annum set forth on the cover
of this offering memorandum and will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on and of
each year, commencing on to Holders of record on the immediately preceding and,
respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest
payment date.

Additional Interest may accrue on the Notes in certain circumstances pursuant to the Registrations
Rights Agreement. See “Registration Rights.”

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will provide for the issuance of additional notes having identical terms and conditions to
the Notes offered hereby, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture (“Additional
_Notes”). Additional Notes will be part of the same issue as the Notes offered hereby under the Indenture for all_
purposes, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, provided that
Additional Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP or ISIN, as applicable, as existing Notes unless such
Additional Notes are fungible with the existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Payments**

Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes will be
payable at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose or, at the option of the paying agent,
payment of interest and Additional Interest, if any, may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at
their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders provided that all payments of principal, premium, if
any, interest and Additional Interest, if any, with respect to Notes represented by one or more global notes
registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the
Issuer’s office or agency will be the office of the Agent maintained for such purpose.

**Guarantees**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will initially be, jointly and severally,
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by the Company and each
Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Credit Agreement (each, a “Guarantor’’).

In addition, if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary acquires or creates a Wholly Owned Domestic
Subsidiary that is a Restricted Subsidiary (and non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned
Subsidiaries guarantee other capital markets debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor) (other than an Immaterial
Subsidiary) after the Issue Date, which Subsidiary guarantees the payment payment of any Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Guarantor, then the Company will cause such new Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee.

40


-----

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit, financial
assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes.”

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate upon:

(1) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of
such Guarantor (after which such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary) or the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or
the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
Discharge”;

(4) to the extent that such Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of
clause (i) of the definition of “Immaterial Subsidiary,” upon the release of the guarantee referred to
in such clause; or

(5) to the extent such Guarantor is also a guarantor or borrower under the Credit Agreement and, at the
time of release of its Guarantee, (x) has been released from its guarantee of, and all pledges and
security, if any, granted in connection with the Credit Agreement, (y) does not Guarantee any
Indebtedness of the Company or any of the other Guarantors, and (z) there is no Indebtedness
outstanding that was Incurred by such Guarantor under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on
Indebtedness” in its status as a Guarantor.

Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and
creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with
respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the
Company, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of
Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits the
incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is
subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the
incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth in the next three paragraphs, the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time prior to, 2017 the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option,
upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of such Notes plus the relevant Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Interest, if any, to the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2017 the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole
or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to the percentage of

41


-----

principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes
redeemed, to the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on
of the year indicated below:

amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes
(including Additional Notes), provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional
Notes) issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately thereafter (excluding Notes
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction
of one or more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the
consummation of such Equity Offering). In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one
or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole
discretion), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption date, or
by the redemption date so delayed.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Issuer. If the Issuer delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date
that is after the record date and on or before the next interest payment date, then interest shall be paid in
accordance with the procedures of DTC.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes
as described under the captions “Change of Control,” and “Certain Covenants— Limitation on Sales of Assets
and Subsidiary Stock.” The Company may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market
or otherwise.

42


-----

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Agent, as registrar, will select the Notes
for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the
Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee by the Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements of DTC, or if
the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through
DTC or DTC prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis; provided, however, that no Note in an
unauthorized denomination shall be redeemed in part.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder to be redeemed at the address of such Holder
appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption
notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is
issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to
the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any
conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to
accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to
repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder’s
Notes pursuant to a “Change of Control Offer.” In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a “Change
_of Control Payment” in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus_
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase. If the Change of
Control Payment Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the
accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of
business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to
the Change of Control Payment by the Issuer.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice to each holder (with a
copy to the Trustee) describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering
to repurchase Notes on a certain date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in such notice, which
will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Issuer’s compliance with such
laws and regulations shall not in and of itself cause a breach of their obligations under such covenant.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

43


-----

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so accepted together with an Officers’
Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by
the Issuer.

The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of Notes so tendered the Change of Control
Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail, or cause to be transferred by book
entry, to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered,
if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000
in excess thereof.

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control will be applicable regardless of whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are
applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain
provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchases or redeems the Notes in the
event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

In the event that holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes
accept a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer purchases all of the Notes held by such holders, the Issuer will
have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following
the purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all of the Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the Change of Control Payment plus, to the
extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest on the notes that remain
outstanding, to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date).

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require
the Issuer to repurchase Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all
of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, to another Person or group may be uncertain.

The Credit Agreement provides that certain change of control events with respect to the Company
would constitute a default under the Credit Agreement. Any future credit agreements or other similar agreements
to which the Company or the Issuer becomes a party may contain similar restrictions and provisions and may
also prohibit the Issuer from purchasing any Notes. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the
Company or the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Company or the Issuer could seek the consent of
its lenders to the purchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If
the Company or the Issuer does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain
prohibited from purchasing Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute
an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under such other agreements.
In addition, the exercise by the holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes upon a
Change of Control could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does
not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the
holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Company’s or the Issuer’s then existing financial
resources.

44


-----

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, then, beginning
on that day, and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the
following headings (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

        - “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”

        - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,”

        - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,”

        - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,”

        - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,”

        - “—Limitation on Guarantees,” and

        - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger and Consolidation.”

No Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the indenture or the
notes with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring after the notes attain an Investment Grade
Rating, regardless of whether such actions or event would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended
Covenants remained in effect. The Suspended Covenants will not be reinstated even if the Company
subsequently does not satisfy the requirements set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above. After the Suspended
Covenants have been suspended, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall remain subject to the
provisions of the indenture described above under the caption “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of
Control” and described under the following subheadings:

      - “Liens,”

      - “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” (other than the financial test set forth in clause (3) of
that covenant), and

      - “SEC Reports.”

If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status or if a Default or Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had
never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including
in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the
Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of

45


-----

Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that
the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence); provided,
_however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture or_
the Notes with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall bear any liability under the Indenture or the Notes for, any actions taken or events occurring during the
Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation
entered into during the Suspension Period and not in contemplation of an impending Reversion Date, regardless
of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in
effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion
Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to
have been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set
forth in the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (to the extent such Indebtedness would be
permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to the Indebtedness Incurred
prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would
not be so permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the first and second paragraphs of “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted
under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Calculations made after the
Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had
been in effect since the Issue Date and throughout the Suspension Period; provided, that, no Subsidiaries may be
designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made
during the Suspension Period will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first
paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” During the Suspension Period, any future obligation to
grant further Note Guarantees shall be suspended. All such further obligation to grant Note Guarantees shall be
reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue any shares of
Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock; provided, that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue
shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock and issue shares of Preferred Stock, if the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters
for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional
Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least 2.00 to
1.00, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the
additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the
case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four- quarter
period; provided that the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness), Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or issued, as applicable, pursuant to
the foregoing by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not the Issuer or Guarantors shall not exceed $100.0 million.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) the incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to any Credit Facility; provided that the aggregate
principal amount of all such Indebtedness outstanding under this clause (1) as of any date of

46


-----

incurrence (after giving pro forma effect to the application of the proceeds of such incurrence) shall
not exceed (i) the greater of (A) $350 million, and (B) the sum of (x) 85% of the net book value of
the accounts receivable of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (y) 75% of the total
Eligible Inventory of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, and (z) the sum of (A) 75% of
the Eligible Real Property of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (B) 85% of of the
value of the Eligible Equipment of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, in
each case determined in accordance with GAAP and calculated on a pro forma basis to give effect
to any acquisitions or dispositions of assets made in connection with any transaction on the date of
calculation; plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause
or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid
interest, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Company or any
Guarantor so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the
Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness, Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock held by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness, Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock being beneficially held by a Person
other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness, Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock to a
Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, shall be deemed,
in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), including any
Guarantee thereof, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses
(1) and (3)) outstanding on the Issue Date, and (c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of
any Indebtedness described in this clause or clauses (5), (7) or (13) of this paragraph or Incurred
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(5) Indebtedness of (x) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred or issued to finance an
acquisition or (y) Persons that are acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or
merged into or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture; provided that after giving effect to such acquisition, merger or
consolidation, either:

(a) the Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of this covenant; or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiary would not be
lower than immediately prior to such acquisition, merger or consolidation.

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes);

(7) Indebtedness represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations, in an
aggregate principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, including Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof, does not exceed $125.0 million;

47


-----

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations,
performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, value added or other
tax or other guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and completion
guarantees and warranties provided by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to
liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
past practices (other than Guarantees for borrowed money), (b) the honoring by a bank or other
financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practices; provided, however, that such
Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of Incurrence; (c) customer deposits and
advance payments received in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practices
from customers for goods or services purchased in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practices; (d) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar
instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practices, and (e) any customary cash management, cash
pooling or netting or setting off arrangements in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
past practices;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for guarantees, indemnification, obligations in
respect of earn-outs or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in
each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or
assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of Indebtedness
Incurred by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the
purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); provided that the maximum liability of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness in connection with a
Disposition shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair market value of non-cash
proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in
value), actually received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such
disposition;

(10) Indebtedness of Non-Guarantors in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $20.0
million and (b) 1.5% of the Total Assets of the Company at any time outstanding and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof;

(11) Indebtedness consisting of promissory notes issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or permitted transferees, assigns, estates, or heirs of such employee, director or consultant), to
finance the purchase or redemption of Capital Stock of the Company that is permitted by the
covenant described below under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(12) Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries consisting of (i) the financing of
insurance premiums Incurred in the ordinary course of business or (ii) take-or-pay obligations
contained in supply arrangements, in each case; and

(13) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of (a) $100.0
million and (b) 6.75% of the Total Assets of the Company at the time of Incurrence.

48


-----

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness meets
the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second
paragraphs of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time
to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type
of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this
covenant;

(2) subject to clause (3) below, additionally, all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness may later
be classified as having been Incurred pursuant to any type of Indebtedness described in the first and
second paragraphs of this covenant so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred
pursuant to such provision at the time of reclassification;

(3) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Credit Agreement shall be deemed
Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this
covenant;

(4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1),
(7), (10) or (13) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one
or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends
in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments
or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof
in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount of the
Indebtedness, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if
such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

49


-----

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being
refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will
provide that the Company and the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly,
Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinated or junior in right of payment to
any Indebtedness of the Company, the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee to the extent and in the
same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as
the case may be.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured
Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other
senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by
different collateral.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Company’s or any
Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including, without limitation, any payment in connection
with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified
Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the Company;
and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case
of any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders of its
Capital Stock other than the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro
rata basis);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Company held by
Persons other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled
maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Indebtedness
(other than (a) any such purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or
retirement in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final
maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause
(3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”); or

(4) make any Restricted Investment;

50


-----

(any such dividend, distribution, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition,
retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (4) are referred to herein as a
“Restricted Payment”), if at the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted
Payment:

(a) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter
therefrom);

(b) the Company is not able to Incur an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph under the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant after giving effect, on a pro
_forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; or_

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made
subsequent to October 1, 2001 (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments
permitted below by clause (6) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other
Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph) would exceed the sum of
(without duplication):

(i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for the period (taken as one
accounting period) beginning on October 1, 2001 to the end of the Company’s most
recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the
time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such
period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit; plus

Company subsequent to the Issue Date (other than (x) Net Cash Proceeds or property or
assets or marketable securities received from an issuance or sale of such Capital Stock
pursuant to an incentive plan established by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, (y) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable
securities to the extent that any Restricted Payment has been made from such proceeds in

of the Company for the benefit of their employees to the extent funded by the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary) by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to
the Issue Date of any Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock that has been converted into or
exchanged for Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) plus,
without duplication, the amount of any cash, and the fair market value of property or
assets or marketable securities, received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
upon such conversion or exchange;

(iv) 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the fair market value, as determined
in good faith by the Company, of marketable securities or other property received by
means of: (i) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Company or a Restricted

Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date; and

(v) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary

associated with the Unrestricted Subsidiary so designated or merged or consolidated or
Indebtedness associated with the assets so transferred), other than to the extent of the
amount of the Investment that constituted a Permitted Investment.

As of March 29, 2014, the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (c) above would
have been approximately $215.2 million.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof if at
the date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture, or
the redemption, repurchase or retirement of Indebtedness if, at the date of any irrevocable
redemption notice, such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture as if it
were and is deemed at such time to be a Restricted Payment at the time of such notice;

(2) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Capital
Stock or Subordinated Indebtedness made by exchange (including any such exchange pursuant to
the exercise of a conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the

Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) (“Refunding Capital Stock”) or a
substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified
Stock or through an Excluded Contribution) of the Company; provided, however, that to the extent
so applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value of property or assets or of marketable
securities, from such sale of Capital Stock or such contribution will be excluded from clause (c) of
the preceding paragraph;

(3) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of
Subordinated Indebtedness made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially
concurrent sale of, Subordinated Indebtedness that constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness permitted
to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” above;

(4) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Preferred
Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary made by exchange for or out of the proceeds of

the Company or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary to replace Preferred Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock) of the Company) of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be, that, in each case, is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” above;

52


-----

(5) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of
Subordinated Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary:

Subsidiary Stock” below, but only if the Company shall have first complied with the terms
described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and purchased all
Notes tendered pursuant to any offer to repurchase all the Notes required thereby, prior to
purchasing, repurchasing, redeeming, defeasing or otherwise acquiring or retiring such
Subordinated Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; or

(b) to the extent required by the agreement governing such Subordinated Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, following the occurrence of a Change of Control (or
other similar event described therein as a “change of control”), but only if the Company shall
have first complied with the terms described under “—Change of Control” and purchased all
Notes tendered pursuant to the offer to repurchase all the Notes required thereby, prior to
purchasing, repurchasing, redeeming, defeasing or otherwise acquiring or retiring such
Subordinated Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock;

(6) a Restricted Payment to pay for the repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for
value of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company held by any future, present
or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or permitted
transferees, assigns, estates, trusts or heirs of such employee, director or consultant) either pursuant
to any management equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit
plan or agreement or upon the termination of such employee, director or consultant’s employment
or directorship; provided, however, that the aggregate Restricted Payments made under this clause
do not exceed $5.0 million in any calendar year (with unused amounts in any calendar year being
carried over to succeeding calendar years subject to a maximum of $10.0 million in any calendar
year); provided further that such amount in any calendar year may be increased by an amount not
to exceed:

(a) the cash proceeds from the sale of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the
Company to members of management, directors or consultants of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that occurred after the Issue Date, to the extent the cash proceeds from the sale of
such Capital Stock have not otherwise been applied to the payment of Restricted Payments by
virtue of clause (c) of the preceding paragraph; plus

(b) the cash proceeds of key man life insurance policies received by the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date; less

(c) the amount of any Restricted Payments made in previous calendar years pursuant to clauses

and provided further that cancellation of Indebtedness owing to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary from members of management, directors, employees or consultants of the Company or
Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with a repurchase of Capital Stock of the Company will not be
deemed to constitute a Restricted Payment for purposes of this covenant or any other provision of
the Indenture;

(7) the declaration and payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary, Incurred in accordance with the terms of the covenant described under “—Limitation
on Indebtedness” above;

53


-----

(8) purchases, repurchases, redemptions, defeasances or other acquisitions or retirements of Capital
Stock deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options, warrants or other rights in respect
thereof if such Capital Stock represents a portion of the exercise price thereof;

(9) repurchases of shares of capital stock and the payment of cash dividends on the Company’s
Common Stock in an annual aggregate amount not to exceed $0.24 multiplied by the number of
shares of the Company’s Common Stock outstanding as of the date of such repurchase or the
record date for such dividends (such $0.24 amount shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits, stock consolidations and similar transactions);

(10) payments by the Company to holders of Capital Stock of the Company in lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares of such Capital Stock, provided, however, that any such payment, loan, advance,
dividend or distribution shall not be for the purpose of evading any limitation of this covenant or
otherwise to facilitate any dividend or other return of capital to the holders of such Capital Stock
(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors);

(11) Restricted Payments that are made with Excluded Contributions;

(12) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would result from),
Restricted Payments (including loans or advances) in an aggregate amount outstanding at the time
made not to exceed $75.0 million;

therefrom), mandatory redemptions of Disqualified Stock issued as a Restricted Payment or as
consideration for a Permitted Investment;

(14) any Restricted Payments made by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that,
immediately after giving pro forma effect thereto and the Incurrence of any Indebtedness the net
proceeds of which are used to finance such Restricted Payment, the Consolidated Total Leverage
Ratio would be no greater than 2.50 to 1.00; and

(15) the designation of a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided that (x) the
assets of such Restricted Subsidiary immediately prior to such designation consists only of
operations in the United Kingdom, (y) the total assets of such Restricted Subsidiary less all
liabilities of such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities for which the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary will be liable immediately after such designation) is less than 15% of the
Company’s total consolidated assets less total consolidated liabilities (on the most recently
available quarterly or annual consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in conformity
with GAAP), provided further, that the net assets of such Restricted Subsidiary may exceed 15% of
the Company’s net assets to the extent that the Company would be permitted to make a Restricted
Payment in an amount equal to such excess and (z) immediately prior to and after giving effect to
such designation, the Company could incur at least $1 of additional Indebtedness under the first
paragraph set forth under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
Stock” as if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio were 2.75 to 1.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Restricted Payments” covenant, in the event that a
Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in
clauses (1) through (15) above, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company will
be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify
such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, except that the
Company may not reclassify any Restricted Payments as having been made under clause (14) above if originally
made under another clause or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant.

54


-----

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of
any cash Restricted Payment shall be their face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted
Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the
Company acting in good faith.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or permit to exist any Lien that secures Indebtedness (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of its property
or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company), whether owned on the Issue Date
or acquired after that date, (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), without effectively providing that the Notes shall be
secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) the obligations so secured for so long as such obligations are so
secured.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the
release and discharge of the Initial Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of
such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary (other than a Guarantor) to, create
or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction
on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating_
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the
subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances
made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility or (b) any other agreement or
instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date (or otherwise required as of
the Issue Date);

55


-----

(2) the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such
Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such
agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in,
or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired
by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary or such agreement or instrument was entered into in contemplation of or
in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes
of this clause, if another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or
transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted
under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or
encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other
security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations or Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions
on the property so acquired;

(7) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or
indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction)
pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements,
organizational documents and other similar agreements and instruments;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practices;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(11) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries permitted to be
Incurred or issued subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant

56


-----

described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” that impose restrictions solely on the Foreign
Subsidiaries party thereto or their Subsidiaries;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to
the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement, together
with the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in
comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) and where, in the case of
clause (ii), either (a) the Company determines at the time of issuance of such Indebtedness that
such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company’s
ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) such encumbrance or restriction
applies only during the continuance of a default relating to such Indebtedness;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on
Liens”; or

(14) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise extends, renews, restates, replaces, restructures
or refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in clauses (1) to (13) of this paragraph or this
clause (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement, extension, renewal,
restatement, replacement, restructuring or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses
(1) to (13) of this paragraph or this clause (14); provided, however, that the encumbrances and
restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are not materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances
and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing
or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the
Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent
or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the
date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for,
any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as
the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, at its respective option, will apply such Net
Available Cash from any Asset Disposition:

(a) (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor or that is secured by a
Lien (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted

57


-----

Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof) within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and
(B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with any
prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related
commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid,
repaid or purchased; or (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided
further that, to the extent the Company redeem, repay or repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness
pursuant to this clause (ii), the Company shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under
the Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to the
extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an
offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer) to all
Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of
accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would
otherwise be prepaid; or

(b) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in
Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the
Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of
such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however,
that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding
agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Company that is
executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such
investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a) or_
clause (b) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise
use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under
the Indenture. If the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds $40 million, the
Company will within 10 Business Days be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of
Notes issued under such Indenture and, to the extent the Company or the Issuer elects, to all holders of other
outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari
Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any,
to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the
agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, with respect to the Notes, in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will deliver notice
of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee and Agent, to
each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance
with the procedures of DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and
offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date
will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu

58


-----

Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess
Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on
the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, provided that no
Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net
amount of funds in U.S. dollars that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into U.S.
dollars.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net
Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or
delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or
(z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United
States, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with
this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long,
as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to use
reasonable efforts (as determined in the Company’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the
applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would
otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law,
applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation), and if within one year
following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any
of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational
impediment or other impediment, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Available
Cash will be promptly (and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such repatriation could be
made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not
repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Company has
determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition
would have an adverse Tax cost consequence with respect to such Net Available Cash (which for the avoidance
of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so Holdings, the Company, any
Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity partners would incur a tax liability,
including a tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding tax), the Net Available
Cash so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment
amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or
an Event of Default.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) and the release
of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other
liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

59


-----

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $40.0 million; and (ii) 3.0% of the Total Assets of the
Company (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being
measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed
to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The Credit Agreement prohibits the Issuer from purchasing any Notes and also provides that certain
asset sale events with respect to the Company or the Issuer would constitute a default under the Credit
Agreement. Any future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Company or the Issuer
becomes a party may contain similar restrictions and provisions and may also prohibit the Issuer from purchasing
any Notes. In the event an Asset Disposition occurs at a time when the Company or the Issuer is prohibited from
purchasing the Notes, the Company or the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the
Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company or the Issuer
does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the
Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under
the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
enter into or conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the
rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
value in excess of $5.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of $35.0 million, the
terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of
this paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or

entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock
appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or
similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees,
directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practices;

(3) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(4) the payment of compensation, reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension
expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (whether directly or indirectly and including through
any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(5) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of
funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time

disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect;

(6) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each
case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practices, which are fair to the
Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors or the senior management of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are
on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from
an unaffiliated party;

(7) any transaction between or among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of
the Company or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely
because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls
such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(8) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company or options,
warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock and the granting of registration and other
customary rights in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary;

(9) transactions in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of
clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(10) any purchases by the Company’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is
purchased by Persons who are not the Company’s Affiliates; provided that such purchases by the

61


-----

Company’s Affiliates are on the same terms as such purchases by such Persons who are not the
Company’s Affiliates; and

(11) transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary, so long as not entered in contemplation of
the redesignation as a Restricted Subsidiary, with an Affiliate prior to the redesignation of any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary as described under the caption “Designation of
Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as Unrestricted will be deemed to be an Investment
made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the
covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or
under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That
designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted
Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company giving effect to such
designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions
and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Restricted Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the
Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the
covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company will be
in default of such covenant.

The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant
described under the caption “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Indebtedness,” calculated on a pro forma
basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default
or Event of Default would be in existence before or after such designation. Any such designation by the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of a
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

Whether or not the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, so long as any notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee:

(1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports of the Company containing
substantially all of the financial information that would have been required to be contained in an
Annual Report on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act if the Company had been a reporting company
under the Exchange Act (but only to the extent similar information is included in this Offering
Memorandum), including (A) “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations,” and (B) audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP;

62


-----

(2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, quarterly
reports of the Company containing substantially all of the financial information that would have
been required to be contained in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act if the
Company had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act, including (A) “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and (B) unaudited
quarterly financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; and

(3) within the time periods specified for filing Current Reports on Form 8-K after the occurrence of
each event that would have been required to be reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K under the
Exchange Act if the Company had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act, current
reports containing substantially all of the information that would have been required to be
contained in a Current Report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act if the Company had been a
reporting company under the Exchange Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, such reports (A) will not be required to comply with Section 302,
Section 906 or Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC, or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K (with respect to any non- GAAP financial measures
contained therein) and (B) will not be required to contain the separate financial information for Guarantors or
Subsidiaries whose securities are pledged to secure the Notes contemplated by Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of
Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.

In addition, the Company shall furnish to noteholders, prospective investors, broker-dealers and
securities analysts, upon their request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act so long as the notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

If at any time any of the Subsidiaries of the Company that have been designated as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries have combined net assets exceeding 10% of the Company’s consolidated net assets, then the
quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this covenant will include or be
accompanied by a reasonably detailed presentation of the financial condition and results of operations of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that any parent of the Company becomes a guarantor of the Notes, the Indenture will permit
the Company to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the
Company by furnishing financial information relating to such parent; provided that the same is accompanied by
consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to
such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a
standalone basis, on the other hand.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to
above to the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes if the Company has filed such reports with the SEC via the
EDGAR filing system and such reports are publicly available; provided, however, that the Trustee shall have no
responsibility whatsoever to determine if such filing has occurred.

**_Limitation on Guarantees_**

The Company will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries
(and non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries guarantee other capital markets
debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor), other than a Guarantor, to Guarantee any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Guarantor or and, unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 30 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture providing for a senior Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect
to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express

63


-----

terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such
guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in
right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is
subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee;

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit
or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against
the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted
Subsidiary under its Guarantee until payment in full of Obligations under the Indenture; and

(3) such Restricted Subsidiary shall deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that:

(a) such Guarantee has been duly executed and authorized; and

(b) such Guarantee constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of such Restricted
Subsidiary, except insofar as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar laws (including all laws relating to fraudulent transfers) and except insofar as
enforcement thereof is subject to general principals of equity;

provided that this covenant shall not be applicable (i) to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed
at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in
contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in the event that the Guarantee of the
Company’s obligations under the Notes or the Indenture by such Subsidiary would not be permitted under
applicable law, or if a consent is required thereunder and cannot be reasonably obtained in the good faith
judgment of the Company.

The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to
be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such Subsidiary shall only be required to comply with the
30-day period described above.

If any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, the Company shall have the right, by execution and
delivery of a supplemental indenture to the Trustee, to cause such Immaterial Subsidiary to cease to be a
Guarantor, subject to the requirement described in the first paragraph above that such Subsidiary shall be
required to become a Guarantor if it ceases to be an Immaterial Subsidiary (except that if such Subsidiary has
been properly designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary it shall not be so required to become a Guarantor or
execute a supplemental indenture); provided, further, that such Immaterial Subsidiary shall not be permitted to
Guarantee any Indebtedness of the Company or the other Guarantors, unless it again becomes a Guarantor.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Company_

Neither the Company nor the Issuer will consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or
lease all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized
and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of
Columbia, Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, any member of the European Union, or any
state, province or division of any of the foregoing countries and the Successor Company (if not the
Company or the Issuer, as the case may be) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company or the Issuer, as the case
may be under the Notes and the Indenture, provided that if such Successor Company is not a
corporation, a co-obligor of the Notes that is a Restricted Subsidiary is a corporation organized
under such laws;

64


-----

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of
such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time
of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be
able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal,
valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company, provided that in giving
an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact,
including as to satisfaction of clauses (2) and (3) above.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties
and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Company under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in
this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may
consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other
Restricted Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions
referred to in this sentence), the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Company, reincorporating the
Company in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Company.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than the Company) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person, or

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, to any Person, or

65


-----

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into the Guarantor, unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor concurrently with the
transaction; or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee of the
Notes; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and
is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Indenture

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Interest, if any, on any Note when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase,
upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply with the Company’s agreements or obligations contained in the Indenture for 60
days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of 30% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which
default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment
_default”); or_

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”);_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $35.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited

66


-----

consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), to pay final judgments
aggregating in excess of $35.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided
by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy issuers, which final judgments
remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment
becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding
has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed
(the “judgment default provision”); or

(7) any Guarantee of the Notes ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee of the
Notes, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of such Guarantee in
accordance with the Indenture.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the
default and, with respect to clauses (3) and (6) the Company does not cure such default within the time specified
in clauses (3) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the
Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the
Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable and to the extent such Event of Default arises
from the failure to pay the redemption price that is then due and not subject to any conditions in connection with
an optional redemption, the premium then due with respect to such optional redemption on all the Notes to be
due and payable. Upon such a declaration, the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes
will be due and payable immediately together with any premium new with respect to an optional redemption. In
the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under
“—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to
clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave
rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration
of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict
with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes that became due
solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is
continuing the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive
all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest, including Additional Interest, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and
its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

67


-----

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders
have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any fee, loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue
any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee
against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such
60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to
use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however,
may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is
unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior
to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against
all liabilities, losses, expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such
occurrence by the Company in writing, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days
after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium,
if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it in good faith determines that
withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within
120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of
any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within
30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which they are aware which would constitute
certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating
to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations described above under the heading “—Certain
Covenants—Reports,” and for any failure to comply with the requirements of Section 314(a) of the Trust
Indenture Act, if any, will for the 60 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default consist exclusively of
the right to receive additional interest on the principal amount of the Notes at a rate equal to 0.25% per annum.
This additional interest will be payable in the same manner and subject to the same terms as other interest
payable under the Indenture. This additional interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the
date on which an Event of Default relating to a failure to comply with the reporting obligations described above
under the heading “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or Section 314(a) of the Trust Indenture Act first occurs, if
applicable, to but excluding the 60th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to
such reporting obligations is cured or waived). If the Event of Default resulting from such failure to comply with

68


-----

the reporting obligations is continuing on such 60th day, such additional interest will cease to accrue and the
Notes will be subject to the other remedies provided under the heading “—Events of Default.”

The Notes will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances,
but only if the Trustee is indemnified to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain
actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action,
notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes)
and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). However an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other
than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Holder’s
Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment
on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium, interest
or Additional Interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(8) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may
amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to
this “Description of Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company under any
Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

-----

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Company) for the issuance
of Additional Notes;

(7) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” to add Guarantees with
respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence

securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of
Holders to transfer Notes.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given
in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture
(“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations,
including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of
the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing
temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust.

The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under the covenants described under “—Certain
Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Merger and Consolidation”) and “—Change of Control” and the
default provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the
cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to
the Company and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision and the guarantee provision described
under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its
covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Company and Significant Subsidiaries),
(6) or (7) under “—Events of Default” above.

70


-----

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee, as paying agent, cash in dollars or U.S. Government Obligations or a
combination thereof deemed sufficient in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of public accountants for
the payment of principal and Additional Interest, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States stating that Holders of the Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at
the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in
the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a
ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law
since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect
of Section 547 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(4) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all conditions precedent provided for
or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding
Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds
have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not
previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and
payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at
the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money or U.S.
Government Obligations, or a combination thereof deemed sufficient in the opinion of a nationally recognized
firm of public accountants, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on
the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest and
Additional Interest, if any, to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to
the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other
sums payable under the Indenture; and (4) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge”
section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with;
_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to_
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or shareholder of the Company or any of its
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations

71


-----

or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under
the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Wells Fargo Bank, National Association will be appointed as Trustee and Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association will be appointed as Agent (in each of such capacities as paying agent, registrar and transfer agent)
under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an
Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use
the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of
the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of
the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of
any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the
Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and
(2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet
certain minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting as
Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a
bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment
of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes
and expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders of the Notes, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as
any Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered to DTC, delivery
of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the
Holders of book-entry interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after
being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class
mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to him if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,

the action specified and reasonably anticipated to result from such actions and (y) such actions have been taken
or initiated and the benefits resulting therefrom are anticipated by the Company to be realized within twelve
(12) months). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest
on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation
Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to
such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the rate of interest
implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the
computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed with a pro
_forma basis shall be computed based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date except as set forth in_
the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest
rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be

chosen as the Company may designate.

herein to GAAP shall thereafter be construed to mean IFRS (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture),
including as to the ability of the Company to make an election pursuant to the previous sentence; provided that
any such election, once made, shall be irrevocable; provided, further, that any calculation or determination in the
Indenture that require the application of GAAP for periods that include fiscal quarters ended prior to the
Company’s election to apply IFRS shall remain as previously calculated or determined in accordance with
GAAP; provided, further again, that the Company may only make such election if it also elects to report any
subsequent financial reports required to be made by the Company, including pursuant to Section 13 or

(2) entered into primarily for purposes of assuring in any other manner the obligee of such

ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice and (y) standard contractual indemnities or product
warranties provided in the ordinary course of business, and provided further that the amount of any Guarantee

obligation in respect of which such Guarantee is made and (ii) the maximum amount for which such guaranteeing
Person may be liable pursuant to the terms of the instrument embodying such Guarantee or, if such Guarantee is

**EXCHANGE OFFER; REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

We and the guarantors will enter into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers on or
before the closing of this offering, pursuant to which the Issuer will agree, for the benefit of the holders of the
notes, that the Issuer will, at its own expense, use its reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement (an
“exchange offer registration statement”) with respect to a registered exchange offer (an “exchange offer”) to
exchange the notes for new notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects with the notes, to
cause the exchange offer registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act and
to consummate the exchange offer on or before the 365th day after the date of the initial issuance of the notes.
Once the exchange offer registration statement has been declared effective, the Issuer will offer the exchange
notes in exchange for surrender of the notes. The Issuer will keep the exchange offer open for at least 20 business
days (or longer if required by applicable law) after the date that notice of the exchange offer is mailed to holders
of the notes. For each note surrendered to the Issuer pursuant to the exchange offer, the holder who surrendered
such note will receive an exchange note having a principal amount equal to that of the surrendered note. Interest
on each exchange note will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the note
surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on such note, from the original issue date of such
note.

Under existing interpretations of the Securities Act by the SEC contained in several no action letters to
third parties, and subject to the immediately following sentence, we believe that the exchange notes would
generally be freely transferable by holders thereof after the exchange offer without further registration under the
Securities Act (subject to certain representations required to be made by each holder of notes, as set forth below).
However, any purchaser of notes who is an “affiliate” of the Issuer or any guarantor and any purchaser of notes
who intends to participate in the exchange offer for the purpose of distributing the exchange notes (1) will not be
able to rely on the interpretation of the staff of the SEC, (2) will not be able to tender its notes in the exchange
offer and (3) must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in
connection with any sale or transfer of the notes unless such sale or transfer is made pursuant to an exemption
from such requirements.

In addition, in connection with any resales of exchange notes, any broker dealer (a “Participating Broker
Dealer”), which acquired the notes for its own account as a result of market making or other trading activities
must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act. The SEC has taken the position that
Participating Broker Dealers may fulfill their prospectus delivery requirements with respect to the exchange
notes (other than a resale of an unsold allotment from this offering) with the prospectus contained in the
exchange offer registration statement. The Issuer will agree to make available for a period of up to 180 days after
consummation of the exchange offer a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act to any
Participating Broker Dealer and any other persons with similar prospectus delivery requirements for use in
connection with any resale of exchange notes. A Participating Broker Dealer or any other person that delivers
such a prospectus to purchasers in connection with such resales will be subject to certain of the civil liability
provisions under the Securities Act and will be bound by the provisions of the registration rights agreement
(including certain indemnification rights and obligations thereunder).

Each holder of the notes (other than certain specified holders) who wishes to exchange notes for
exchange notes in the exchange offer will be required to make certain representations, including representations
that (1) any exchange notes to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (2) it has
no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) of the exchange notes, (3) it is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act)
of the Issuer or any guarantor, and (4) if such holder is a broker dealer that will receive exchange notes for its
own account in exchange for notes that were acquired as a result of market making or other trading activities,
then such holder will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, to the extent
applicable, in connection with any resale of the exchange notes.

103


-----

In the event that (1) any changes in law or the applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC do not
permit the Issuer to effect the exchange offer, (2) for any other reason the exchange offer is not consummated
within the time period required by the first paragraph of this “Exchange Offer; Registration Rights” section,
(3) under certain circumstances, the initial purchasers shall so request or (4) any holder of notes (other than the
initial purchasers) is not eligible to participate in the exchange offer, the Issuer will, at its expense, (a) as
promptly as practicable, file with the SEC a shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to be declared effective and (b) use its reasonable
best efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective until the earlier of (1) two years after the issue date
of the notes and (2) the date all notes covered by the shelf registration statement have been sold as contemplated
in the shelf registration statement. The Issuer will, in the event of the filing of the shelf registration statement,
provide to each holder of the notes copies of the prospectus which is a part of the shelf registration statement,
notify each such holder when the shelf registration statement has become effective and take certain other actions
as are required to permit unrestricted resales of the notes. A holder of notes that sells its notes pursuant to the
shelf registration statement generally (1) will be required to be named as a selling security holder in the related
prospectus and to deliver a prospectus to purchasers, (2) will be subject to certain of the civil liability provisions
under the Securities Act in connection with such sales and (3) will be bound by the provisions of the registration
rights agreement that are applicable to such a holder (including certain indemnification rights and obligations
thereunder). In addition, each holder of the notes will be required to deliver information to be used in connection
with the shelf registration statement and to provide comments on the shelf registration statement within the time
periods set forth in the registration rights agreement to have their notes included in the shelf registration
statement and to benefit from the provisions regarding liquidated damages described in the following paragraph.

If the Issuer has not exchanged the exchange notes for all notes validly tendered in accordance with the
terms of an exchange offer on or before the 365th day after the original issue date of the notes or, if applicable, a
shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes has not been declared effective 120 days after any
obligation to file a shelf registration statement arises or such shelf registration statement ceases to be effective at
any time during the shelf registration period (subject to certain exceptions), then additional interest shall accrue
as liquidated damages on the principal amount of the notes at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day
period immediately following such date and by an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent
90-day period, up to a maximum additional rate of 0.50% per annum thereafter, until (i) the exchange offer is
completed, (ii) the shelf registration statement is declared effective or, if such shelf registration statement ceased
to be effective, again becomes effective, or (iii) the second anniversary of the issue date of the notes; as the case
may be, as described in the registration rights agreement. Such liquidated damages shall be the sole remedy of
any holder (other than a Participating Broker Dealer) with respect to the exchange offer and other registration
rights.

This summary of certain provisions of the registration rights agreement does not purport to be complete
and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, the complete provisions of the registration rights agreement, a
copy of which we will make available to holders of notes upon request.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax considerations relating to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes, but is not intended to be a complete analysis of all potential tax
considerations. This summary deals only with beneficial owners of notes that purchase the notes in this offering
at their issue price (generally, the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for money to the
public, not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and that will hold the notes as “capital assets” within the meaning
of section 1221 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (generally,
property held for investment). This summary does not purport to deal with all aspects of United States federal
income taxation that might be relevant to a particular holder in light of its personal investment circumstances or
status, nor does it address tax considerations applicable to an investor that may be subject to special tax rules,
such as certain financial institutions, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, tax exempt
organizations, S corporations, partnerships or other pass through entities for United States federal income tax
purposes or investors in such entities, insurance companies, broker dealers, dealers or traders in securities or
currencies, certain former citizens or residents of the United States subject to section 877 of the Code and
taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax. This summary also does not discuss notes held as part of a
hedge, straddle, synthetic security or conversion transaction, or situations in which the “functional currency” of a
United States Holder (as defined below) is not the United States dollar. This summary also does not address tax
considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes by a holder of our 2018 Notes that
tenders some or all of those notes pursuant to the Tender Offer or by a lender under our ABL Facility whose
loans thereunder are repaid in connection with this offering. Moreover, the effect of any applicable United States
federal estate or gift, state or local or non-United States tax laws is not discussed.

This summary is based on the provisions of the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder
(the “Treasury Regulations”), judicial authority, published administrative positions of the United States Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, each as in effect on the date of this document.
Changes in such rules or new interpretations thereof may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect the
United States federal income tax considerations discussed below. We have not sought any ruling from the IRS
with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached herein and there can be no assurance that the
IRS will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in
the event of litigation.

The following discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax
planning and advice. Investors considering the purchase of notes should consult their own tax advisors with
respect to the application of the United States federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any
tax consequences arising under the federal estate or gift tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-United
States taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

**IRS CIRCULAR 230 DISCLOSURE: ANY STATEMENT HEREIN REGARDING ANY**
**UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT**
**BE USED, BY ANY TAXPAYER FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING ANY PENALTIES THAT MAY**
**BE IMPOSED UNDER THE CODE. THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN WERE WRITTEN IN**
**CONNECTION WITH THE MARKETING OR PROMOTION OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR**
**MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN. YOU SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THE YOUR**
**PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR.**

**Additional payments**

We may be required to pay amounts in redemption of the notes in addition to the stated principal amount
of and interest on the notes in certain circumstances (e.g., in the case of a change in control and, under certain
circumstances, if we sell certain assets, as described in “Description of Notes—Change of Control” and

105


-----

“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”) or to pay
additional interest on the notes in the circumstances described under “Exchange Offer; Registration
Rights”. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of payment of
such additional amounts in redemption of, or such additional interest on, the notes does not result in the notes being
treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. If we become obligated to
pay additional amounts in redemption of the notes, then we intend to take the position that such amounts will be
treated as additional proceeds and taxed as described below under “—United States Holders—Sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of notes” or “—Non-United States Holders—Sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of notes.” If we become obligated to pay additional interest on
the notes, then we intend to take the position that such amounts will be treated as ordinary interest income and taxed
as described below under “—United States Holders—Payment of stated interest” or “—Non-United States
Holders—Payment of stated interest.” These positions will be based on our determination that, as of the date of the
issuance of the notes, the possibility that additional amounts in redemption of, or additional interest on, the notes
will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations.

Our determination that a contingency is remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder
explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the notes that it is taking a
different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that
described above, a holder may be required to accrue interest income based upon a “comparable yield,” regardless
of the holder’s method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate
non-convertible debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions similar to those of
the notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
note would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the
tax consequences of a note being treated as a contingent payment debt instrument. The remainder of this
discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**Exchange of notes in the exchange offer**

The exchange of notes for exchange notes in the contemplated exchange offer will not constitute a
taxable event. Consequently, a holder’s basis in an exchange note will be the same as its tax basis immediately
before the exchange in the note exchanged therefor, and the holder’s holding period for the exchange note will
include the holder’s holding period for the note exchanged therefor.

**United States Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax considerations if you are a
United States Holder. As used herein, the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is,
for United States federal income tax purposes:

      - an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States;

      - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

      - an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

      - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its
administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its
substantial decisions, or (ii) in the case of a trust that was treated as a domestic trust under the law
in effect before 1997, a valid election is in place under applicable Treasury regulations to treat such
trust as a domestic trust.

106


-----

In the case of a beneficial owner of notes that is classified as a partnership for United States federal
income tax purposes, the United States federal income tax treatment of the notes to a partner of the partnership
generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner of a
partnership holding notes should consult its own tax advisor.

**_Payment of stated interest_**

Stated interest on a note will be included in the gross income of a United States Holder as ordinary
income at the time such interest is accrued or received, in accordance with the holder’s method of accounting for
United States federal income tax purposes.

**_Sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, a United States
Holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized upon the
disposition and (ii) the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. The amount realized will be equal to the sum of the
amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in exchange for the note (less any portion
allocable to any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxed as ordinary interest income to the extent not
previously so taxed). A United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal the cost of the
note to such holder. This gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or
loss if the United States Holder has held the note for more than one year. In general, long-term capital gains of a
non-corporate United States Holder are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. United States Holders should consult their own tax
advisors as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

In general, certain information must be reported to the IRS with respect to payments of interest on a note
and payments of the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a note, to
certain non-corporate United States Holders. The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) may be
required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 28 percent, if (i) the payee fails to furnish a
taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor or to establish an exemption from backup withholding;
(ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect; (iii) there has been a notified
payee underreporting described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the payee has not certified under penalties
of perjury that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS has not notified the payee that it is subject to
backup withholding under the Code. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment
to a United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against that holder’s United States federal income tax
liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the
IRS.

**_Additional tax on net investment income_**

Legislation enacted in 2010 imposes a 3.8% tax on the “net investment income” (or undistributed “net
investment income,” in the case of a trust or estate) of certain United States Holders that are individuals, trusts or
estates and that have modified adjusted gross income (or adjusted gross income, in the case of a trust or estate)
above a certain threshold (which in the case of an individual is between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on
the individual’s circumstances), for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. A United States Holder’s
“net investment income” generally includes, among other things, interest income on and capital gain from the
disposition of securities like the notes, subject to certain exceptions. If you are a United States holder that is an
individual, estate or trust, you are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the applicability of this tax to
your investment in the notes.

107


-----

**Non-United States Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax considerations if you are a nonUnited States Holder. For purposes of this discussion, the term “non-United States Holder” means a beneficial
owner of a note that is, for United States federal income tax purposes:

      - a nonresident alien individual;

      - a foreign corporation; or

      - a foreign estate or trust.

The following discussion applies only to non-United States Holders, and assumes that no item of
income, gain, deduction or loss derived by the non-United States Holder in respect of the notes at any time is
effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business. Special rules, not discussed herein,
may apply to certain non-United States Holders, such as:

      - certain former citizens or residents of the United States;

      - controlled foreign corporations;

      - passive foreign investment companies;

      - corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; and

      - non-United States Holders that are engaged in the conduct of a United States trade or business.

**_Payment of stated interest_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and the “FATCA” legislation below, interest paid on a
note by us or any paying agent to a non-United States Holder will be exempt from United States income and
withholding tax under the “portfolio interest exemption,” provided that (i) the non-United States Holder does not,
actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to
vote, (ii) the non-United States Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us, actually or
constructively, through stock ownership, (iii) the non-United States Holder is not a bank that acquired the notes
in consideration for an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course
of its trade or business, and (iv) either (a) the non-United States Holder provides to us or our paying agent an IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or a suitable substitute form), signed under penalties of perjury, that includes its
name and address and that certifies its non-United States status in compliance with applicable law and
regulations, or (b) a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’
securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business on behalf of the non-United States Holder provides a
statement to us or our agent under penalties of perjury in which it certifies that an IRS Form W-8BEN or W8BEN-E (or a suitable substitute form) has been received by it from the non-United States Holder or qualifying
intermediary and furnishes a copy to us or our agent. This certification requirement may be satisfied with other
documentary evidence in the case of a note held in an offshore account or through certain foreign intermediaries.

If a non-United States Holder cannot satisfy the requirements of the portfolio interest exemption
described above, cash payments of interest made to such holder generally will be subject to United States
withholding tax at the rate of 30 percent, unless the holder provides us or our agent with a properly executed IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or suitable substitute form) establishing an exemption from or reduction in
withholding under the benefit of an applicable tax treaty.

**_Sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of notes_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and the “FATCA” legislation below, a non-United
States Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain
realized on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of a note (other than any amount
representing accrued but unpaid interest on the note, which is subject to the rules discussed above under “NonUnited States Holders—Payment of stated interest” above) unless the non-United States Holder is an individual
who was present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other
conditions are met. If a non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days
or more during the taxable year of the sale, exchange, redemption retirement or other disposition of a note, and
certain other requirements are met, then such non-United States Holder generally will be subject to United States
federal income tax at a 30 percent rate (unless a lower applicable treaty rate applies) on the amount by which
such non-United States Holder’s capital gains allocable to United States sources for the taxable year exceeds
such non-United States Holder’s capital losses allocable to United States sources for the taxable year.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

The amount of interest paid to a non-United States Holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld from
such payment generally must be reported annually to the non-United States Holder and to the IRS. The IRS may
make this information available under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty to the tax authorities in
the country in which the non-United States Holder is resident.

Provided that a non-United States Holder has complied with certain reporting procedures (usually
satisfied by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption, the nonUnited States Holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to interest payments on,
and the proceeds from the disposition of, a note, unless we or our paying agent know or have reason to know that
the holder is a United States person. Additional rules relating to information reporting requirements and backup
withholding with respect to the payment of proceeds from the disposition (including a redemption or retirement)
of a note are as follows:

      - If the proceeds are paid to or through the United States office of a broker, a non-United States
Holder generally will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless the nonUnited States Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a United States person (usually
on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption.

      - If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-United States office of a broker that is not a United
States person and does not have certain specified United States connections (a “United States
Related Person”), a non-United States Holder will not be subject to information reporting or backup
withholding.

      - If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-United States office of a broker that is a United States
person or a United States Related Person, a non-United States Holder generally will be subject to
information reporting (but generally not backup withholding tax) unless the non-United States
Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a United States person (usually on an IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding tax rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit
against the non-United States Holder’s United States federal income tax liability, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_“FATCA” legislation affecting taxation of notes held by or through foreign entities_**

Legislation enacted in 2010 generally imposes a withholding tax of 30% on interest income on a debt
obligation issued by a United States corporation paid after June 30, 2014 and on the gross proceeds of a

109


-----

disposition of such a debt obligation paid after December 31, 2016 to (i) a foreign financial institution, unless
such institution enters into an agreement with the United States government to collect and provide to the United
States tax authorities substantial information regarding United States account holders of such institution (which
would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are
foreign entities with United States owners) or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution, unless such
entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial United States owners of the
entity, which generally includes any United States person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the
entity.

This new withholding tax generally will not apply to a debt obligation that is outstanding on July 1,
2014, such as the notes, unless such debt obligation undergoes a “significant modification” (within the meaning
of Section 1.1001-3 of the Treasury regulations) after such date. Accordingly, withholding under FATCA will
not apply to the notes unless the terms of the notes were to be significantly modified (within the meaning of
applicable Treasury regulations) on or after July 1, 2014. Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax
advisors regarding the implications of this legislation on their investment in the notes.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, is acting as the representative (the
“Representative”) of the initial purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions of a purchase agreement
dated, 2014 among us, the guarantors and the initial purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the initial
purchasers, and each of the initial purchasers has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, all of the
notes sold under the purchase agreement if any of these notes are purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the
purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the nondefaulting initial purchasers may be
increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

**Commissions and Discounts**

The Representative has advised us that the initial purchasers propose initially to offer the notes at the
offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering
price or any other term of the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through
certain of their affiliates.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The initial
purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act
or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The initial purchasers
will not offer or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers or
pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes
within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or
another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the notes will be deemed to have
made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**New Issue of Notes**

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer
quotation system. We have been advised by the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in
the notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue
any market-making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market
for the notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the
notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering
price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and
financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about, 2014, which
will be the business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred

111


-----

to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market are
required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the delivery of the notes hereunder will be required, by
virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time
of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their
date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

We have agreed that we will not, for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering memorandum,
without first obtaining the prior written consent of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, directly
or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any
debt securities or securities exchangeable for or convertible into debt securities, except for the notes sold to the
initial purchasers pursuant to the purchase agreement.

**Short Positions**

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open
market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created
by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than
they are required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by
purchasing notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are
concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that
could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short
sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a
decline in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might
otherwise exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition,
neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that we will engage in these transactions or
that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area (each, a “Relevant Member State”),
no offer of notes may be made to the public in that Relevant Member State other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

(b) to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the
2010 PD Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as
defined in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to
obtaining the prior consent of the Representative; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,

provided that no such offer of notes shall require the Company or the Representative to publish a
prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to
Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive.

112


-----

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Relevant
Member State will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of notes. Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that
Relevant Member State of notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this offering memorandum
may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Company or any of the initial purchasers to
publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive in relation to such offer. Neither the
Company nor the initial purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of notes in
circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Company or the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus for
such offer.

For the purpose of the above provisions, the expression “an offer to the public” in relation to any notes
in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information
on the terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe
the notes, as the same may be varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus
Directive in the Relevant Member State and the expression “Prospectus Directive” means Directive 2003/71/EC
(including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member States) and
includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State and the expression “2010 PD
Amending Directive” means Directive 2010/73/EU.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

In addition, in the United Kingdom, this document is being distributed only to, and is directed only at,
and any offer subsequently made may only be directed at persons who are “qualified investors” (as defined in the
Prospectus Directive) (i) who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within
Article 19 (5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended
(the “Order”) and/or (ii) who are high net worth companies (or persons to whom it may otherwise be lawfully
communicated) falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order (all such persons together being referred to as
“relevant persons”). This document must not be acted on or relied on in the United Kingdom by persons who are
not relevant persons. In the United Kingdom, any investment or investment activity to which this document
relates is only available to, and will be engaged in with, relevant persons.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Switzerland**

This offering memorandum does not constitute an issue prospectus pursuant to Article 652a or Article
1156 of the Swiss Code of Obligations and the notes will not be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Therefore,
this offering memorandum may not comply with the disclosure standards of the listing rules (including any
additional listing rules or prospectus schemes) of the SIX Swiss Exchange. Accordingly, the notes may not be
offered to the public in or from Switzerland, but only to a selected and limited circle of investors who do not
subscribe to the notes with a view to distribution. Any such investors will be individually approached by the
initial purchasers from time to time.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the Dubai International Financial Centre**

This offering memorandum relates to an Exempt Offer in accordance with the Offered Securities Rules
of the Dubai Financial Services Authority (“DFSA”). This offering memorandum is intended for distribution
only to persons of a type specified in the Offered Securities Rules of the DFSA. It must not be delivered to, or
relied on by, any other person. The DFSA has no responsibility for reviewing or verifying any documents in
connection with Exempt Offers. The DFSA has not approved this offering memorandum nor taken steps to verify
the information set forth herein and has no responsibility for the offering memorandum. The notes to which this
offering memorandum relates may be illiquid and/or subject to restrictions on their resale. Prospective purchasers
of the notes offered should conduct their own due diligence on the notes. If you do not understand the contents of
this offering memorandum you should consult an authorized financial advisor.

**Other Relationships**

Some of the initial purchasers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in,
investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates.
They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Each of
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, or their respective affiliates, are lenders under our ABL Facility. As a result,
affiliates of the initial purchasers may receive a portion of the proceeds of the notes.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated is serving as dealer manager and solicitation agent
in our Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation relating to the 2018 Notes. Certain of the initial purchasers or
affiliates of the initial purchasers may be holders of the 2018 Notes and may participate in the Tender Offer and
the Consent Solicitation. As a result, such initial purchasers or affiliates would receive a portion of the proceeds
of this offering to the extent such 2018 Notes are purchased by us in the Tender Offer.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers.
Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. If
the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of these initial purchasers or
their affiliates routinely hedge and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge their
credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such underwriters and
their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of
credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered
hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The
initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

otherwise transferred within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in
Regulation S under the Securities Act), except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to,
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes are being offered and issued only (a) in
the United States, to “qualified institutional buyers” as defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act in
private sales exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A, and
(b) outside the United States, to persons other than U.S. persons (“foreign purchasers”) in reliance on Regulation

Each purchaser of notes offered otherwise than in reliance on Regulation S (the “Restricted Notes”) will
be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A
or Regulation S under the Securities Act are used herein as defined therein):

      - The purchaser is not an “affiliate,” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, of the Company,
or acting on behalf of the Company and it is either (A) (i) a qualified institutional buyer, (ii) is aware
that the sale of the notes to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A and (iii) is acquiring such notes
for its own account or for the account of a qualified institutional buyer or (B) is not a U.S. person and
is acquiring the notes outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S.

      - The purchaser understands that the notes are being offered in a transaction not involving any public
offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that such notes have not been
registered under the Securities Act and agrees that (A) if in the future, the purchaser decides to
offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the notes, such notes may be offered, resold,
pledged or otherwise transferred only (i) in the United States to a person whom the seller
reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A, (ii) outside the United States in a transaction complying with the provisions of Rule 904
under the Securities Act, (iii) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
provided by Rule 144 (if available), (iv) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, (v) to Cott or its subsidiaries or (vi) to an institutional “accredited investor” (as
defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act), or (vii) in
accordance with another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, in each
of cases (i) through (vii) in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any State of the
United States, and that (B) the purchaser will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any
subsequent purchaser of the notes from it of the resale restrictions referred to in (A) above.

      - The purchaser acknowledges that none of the Company or their affiliates, nor the initial purchasers,
nor any persons acting on behalf of any of the foregoing has made any statement, representation or
warranty to the purchaser with respect to the Company or the offer or sale of any notes, other than the
information included in this offering memorandum (including the information incorporated herein by
reference), which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in
making its investment decision with respect to the notes. The purchaser acknowledges that any
information it desires concerning the Company, the notes or any other matter relevant to its decision to
acquire the notes (including this offering memorandum) is or has been made available to it.

full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of
such account.
