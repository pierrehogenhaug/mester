The Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after, 2023 at the redemption prices specified under “Description of Notes— Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. Prior to, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date plus a “make-whole” premium as described in this offering memorandum.

If we experience specific kinds of changes of control, and under certain circumstances, if we sell certain assets, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all or a portion of the notes from the holders at a purchase price of 101% (or 100% in the case of asset sales) of their principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including, the repurchase date.

In addition, the notes will be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including the Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and obligations of Primo Water Corporation’s subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes.

This information and these statements are “forward-looking” within the meaning of securities laws, including the “safe harbor” provisions of the Securities Act (Ontario), the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Section 27A of the Securities Act and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, future expectations and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements that relate to projections of sales, earnings, earnings per share, cash flows, capital expenditures or other financial items, statements regarding our intentions to pay regular quarterly dividends on our common shares, and discussions of estimated future revenue enhancements and cost savings. These statements also relate to our business strategy, goals and expectations concerning our market position, future operations, margins, profitability, liquidity and capital resources. Generally, words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “endeavor,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “should” and similar terms and phrases are used to identify forward-looking statements in this offering memorandum and in the documents incorporated by reference herein. These forward-looking statements reflect current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and are made only as of the date of this offering memorandum or as of the date of the documents incorporated by reference herein. The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and, by their nature, are based on certain estimates and assumptions regarding interest and foreign exchange rates, expected growth, results of operations, performance, business prospects and opportunities and effective income tax rates, which are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Material factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making an estimate set out in forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, assumptions regarding management’s current plans and estimates. Although we believe the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions could prove to be incorrect. Our operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and any one or any combination of these risks and uncertainties could also affect whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020 (our “Form 10-K”), as updated by the risk factors included our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2020, filed with the SEC on May 7, 2020 (our “Q1 Form 10-Q”) and our other reports incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference herein. We caution the reader that the risk factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” herein, in our Form 10-K or in our other reports incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference herein may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

This offering memorandum contains balance sheet data of Cott Corporation (now Primo Water Corporation) as of December 30, 2017, which is derived from Cott Corporation’s audited historical consolidated financial statements not included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum also contains the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Primo Water Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries as of June 27, 2020 and for the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019. The financial information of Primo has been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). On March 2, 2020, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on January 13, 2020, Cott Corporation completed the Legacy Primo Acquisition (as defined below). In connection with the closing of the Legacy Primo Acquisition, Cott Corporation changed its corporate name to Primo Water Corporation. This offering memorandum incorporates by reference the consolidated financial statements of Legacy Primo (as defined below) and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018. The financial information of Legacy Primo has been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of our financial position, operations and cash flows, the terms of this offering and Primo Water Corporation’s and Legacy Primo’s financial information.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150
207_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.5,Non-GAAP Financial Measures,1.5.1,,"In addition to the financial information presented or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum prepared under GAAP, this offering memorandum and the documents incorporated herein contain “non-GAAP financial measures,” that is, financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP measures such as Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, net, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in the financial information provided by the Company. We define Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, net as Revenue, net adjusted to give effect to the divestiture of S. & D. Coffee, Inc., which was completed on February 28, 2020, the divestiture of Cott Beverages LLC, the acquisition of Legacy Primo and elimination of sales from Primo to Legacy Primo. We define EBITDA as (loss) earnings from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding acquisition and integration costs, share-based compensation costs, COVID-19 costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, foreign exchange and other (gains) losses, net, loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, net, gain on extinguishment of long-term debt, (gain) loss on sale of business. RCI/Concentrate Division Contribution to Adjusted EBITDA and other adjustments, net, as the case may be. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net revenue. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the divestiture of S. & D. Coffee, Inc., which was completed on February 28, 2020, the acquisition of Legacy Primo and certain unrealized acquisition synergies anticipated to be achieved in connection with the Legacy Primo Acquisition. Management understands that some industry analysts and investors consider Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, net, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as supplementary non-GAAP, financial measures useful in analyzing a company’s performance. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, net, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as measures of liquidity on an actual or pro forma basis. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, net, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, net, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA may not be v ----- comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, net, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not represent an amount of funds that is available for management’s discretionary use. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, net, Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, is included because management believes it is pertinent to the daily management of operations, and management uses this financial measure to evaluate the impact of operational business decisions. Each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, the financial information of the Company or Legacy Primo reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are: - they do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures or future contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital; - they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest, or principal payments, on indebtedness; - they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; - they do not reflect available liquidity to the Company; and - other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use such measures or may calculate such measures differently than as presented in this offering memorandum, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is adjusted to reflect, among other things, the Legacy Primo Acquisition and certain unrealized acquisition synergies anticipated to be achieved in connection therewith from cost savings. We will be required to make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, and these cash costs are not reflected in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. The expected synergies related to the Legacy Primo Acquisition are inherently uncertain, and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and are beyond our control. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment as a projection that we will achieve these acquisition synergies. You should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results.

207_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,,"Primo is a leading pure-play water solutions provider in North America, Europe and Israel. Primo operates largely under a recurring razor/razorblade revenue model. The razor in Primo’s revenue model is its industry leading line-up of sleek and innovative water dispensers, which are sold through major retailers and online at various price points or leased to customers. The dispensers help increase household penetration, which drives recurring purchases of Primo’s razorblade offering. Primo’s razorblade offering is comprised of Water Direct, Water Exchange, and Water Refill. Through its Water Direct business, Primo delivers sustainable hydration solutions across its 21-country footprint direct to the customer’s door, whether at home or to commercial businesses. Through its Water Exchange and Water Refill businesses, Primo offers pre-filled and reusable containers at over 13,000 locations and water refill units at approximately 22,000 locations, respectively. Primo also offers water filtration units across its 21-country footprint representing a top five position. Primo’s water solutions expand consumer access to purified, spring and mineral water to promote a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle while simultaneously reducing plastic waste and pollution. Primo is committed to its water stewardship standards and is proud to partner with the International Bottled Water Association in North America as well as with Water coolers Europe, which ensure strict adherence to safety, quality, sanitation and regulatory standards for the benefit of consumer protection. The market in which we operate is subject to some seasonal variations. Our water delivery sales are generally higher during the warmer months. Our purchases of raw materials and related accounts payable fluctuate based upon the demand for our products. The seasonality of our sales volume causes our working capital needs to fluctuate throughout the year. We conduct operations in countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange risks to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. As our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations. On February 28, 2020, we completed the sale of our coffee, tea and extract solutions business, S. & D. Coffee, Inc. (“S&D”), to Westrock Coffee Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Westrock”), pursuant to which Westrock acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity of S&D from the Company (“S&D Divestiture”). The consideration was $405.0 million paid at closing in cash, with customary post-closing working capital adjustments, which were resolved in June 2020 by payment of $1.5 million from the Company to Westrock. We used the proceeds of the transaction to finance a portion of the Legacy Primo Acquisition (as defined below). On March 2, 2020, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on January 13, 2020, Cott Corporation completed the acquisition of Primo Water Corporation (“Legacy Primo” and such transaction, the “Legacy Primo Acquisition”). The aggregate consideration paid in the Legacy Primo Acquisition was approximately $798.2 million and includes $377.6 million of our common shares issued by us to holders of Legacy Primo common stock, $216.1 million paid in cash by us to holders of Legacy Primo common stock, $196.9 million of cash paid to retire outstanding indebtedness on behalf of Legacy Primo, $4.7 million to settle a pre-existing liability and $2.9 million in fair value of replacement common share options and restricted stock units for vested Legacy Primo awards. The Legacy Primo Acquisition is consistent with our strategy of transitioning to a pure-play water solutions provider. 1 ----- In connection with the closing of the Legacy Primo Acquisition, Cott Corporation changed its corporate name to Primo Water Corporation and its ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange to “PRMW.” During the second quarter of 2020, we implemented a restructuring program intended to optimize synergies from the Company’s transition to a pure-play water company following the Legacy Primo Acquisition and, as a result, reorganized into two reporting segments: North America (which includes our DS Services of America, Inc. (“DSS”), Aquaterra Corporation (“Aquaterra”), Mountain Valley Spring Company (“Mountain Valley”) and Legacy Primo businesses) and Rest of World (which includes our Eden Springs Nederland B.V. (“Eden”), Aimia Foods Limited (“Aimia”), Decantae Mineral Water Limited (“Decantae”) and John Farrer & Company Limited (“Farrers”) businesses).

Other disclosures related to the use of EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributed to Primo Water Corporation to EBITDA, are included in footnote (5) below and in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” (6) Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA adjusted for items which are not considered by management to be indicative of the underlying results. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the divestiture of S&D, which was completed on February 28, 2020, the acquisition of Legacy Primo and certain unrealized acquisition synergies anticipated to be achieved in connection with the Legacy Primo Acquisition. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our financial performance. However, we have incurred the charges and expenses that constitute these adjustments in prior periods and expect to incur them in future periods. These expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws and actual results may vary due to various risks, including those identified under “Risk Factors.” Because we use these adjusted financial results in the management of our business and to understand underlying business performance, we believe this supplemental information is useful to investors for their independent evaluation and understanding of our business performance and the performance of our management. The nonGAAP financial measures described above are in addition to, and not meant to be considered superior to, or a substitute for, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this offering memorandum reflect our judgment of particular items, and may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

(d) Synergy adjustment assumes $25.0 million in synergies less $4.0 million in synergies already achieved through the twelve months ended June 27, 2020. The $25.0 million represents annualized synergies expected to be achieved over the next twelve months, of which approximately $18.0 million are expected to have been achieved by the end of 2020. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is adjusted, among other things, to reflect the Legacy Primo Acquisition and certain unrealized acquisition synergies anticipated to be achieved in connection therewith from cost savings. We will be required to make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, and these cash costs are not reflected in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. The expected synergies related to the Legacy Primo Acquisition are inherently uncertain, and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and are beyond our control. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment as a projection that we will achieve these acquisition synergies. You should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. See “Risk Factors—We may not realize the expected revenue and cost synergies related to our acquisitions.” in our Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference herein.

Our global operations expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in challenging operating environments. COVID-19 has spread across the globe to all of the countries in which we operate. Authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous measures to stall the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, shelter in place orders, and business shutdowns. These measures have impacted and will further impact us, our customers, employees, distributors, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding how these measures and future measures in response to the pandemic will impact our business, including whether they will result in further changes in demand for our services and products, further increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs or otherwise), and how they will further impact our supply chain, each or all of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our customers, employees, distributors, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may impact the availability of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness, facility closures, quarantine, curfews, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions or other governmental restrictions, our operations will be negatively impacted. Any sustained interruption in our business operations, distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials or other supplies as a result of these measures, restrictions or disruptions can impair our ability to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Compliance with governmental measures imposed in response to COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause us to incur additional costs, and any inability to comply with such measures can subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), to be secured, and any failure to effectively manage these risks, including any failure to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks, may adversely affect our business. 11 ----- As we deliver bottled water to residential and business customers across a 21-country footprint and provide multi-gallon purified bottled water, self-service refill drinking water and water dispensers to customers through major retailers in North America, the profile of the services we provide and the products we sell, and the amount of revenue attributable to such services and products, varies by jurisdiction and changes in demand as a result of COVID-19 will vary in scope and timing across these markets. For example, to date, we have seen an increase in volumes in our residential water direct business and a decrease in volumes in our commercial water direct business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any continued economic uncertainty can adversely affect our customers’ financial condition, resulting in an inability to pay for our services or products, reduced or canceled orders of our services or products, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with the items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition may also result in our recording impairment charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable. In addition, economic uncertainty associated with COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets, which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols and other operational actions in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on our employees and our business, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the prices of our publicly traded securities may be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150

As of June 27, 2020, we had approximately $219.3 million of secured borrowings (net of unamortized debt issuance costs and premiums on debt) outstanding, which includes the amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to (i) the repayment of $70 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility since June 27, 2020 and (ii) the borrowing of approximately $21.9 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, expected to occur on or about the Redemption Date, to be used in connection with the Notes offering fees and expenses and the payment of the Redemption premium, fees and expenses, but excludes $44.7 million in outstanding, but undrawn, letters of credit. The Indenture that will govern the notes will permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, bankruptcy or any similar proceeding, holders of our secured obligations will have claims that are prior to claims of the holders of the notes or the guarantees with respect to the assets securing those obligations, which are substantially all of our assets.

A change of control event under the Indenture that will govern the notes could also constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing the 2025 Notes, which could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding thereunder. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions and provisions. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price for all the notes tendered by the holders or such other indebtedness and under the Indenture that will govern the notes we may not be permitted to repurchase such other indebtedness, which could result in an event of default under such indebtedness. Moreover, under the Indenture that will govern the notes, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a “change of control” and thus would not give rise to any repurchase rights. Thus, there can be no assurance that in the event of a change of control we will have sufficient funds to satisfy our obligations with respect to any or all of the tendered notes.

207_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to this Offering,13.2.6,"Certain laws may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void guarantees and require note holders to return payments received from guarantors.","Under certain bankruptcy and fraudulent transfer laws, a court could void a guarantee or subordinate a guarantee to all of our other debts or all other debts of a guarantor if, among other things, the guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such indebtedness and: - the guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; - the guarantor was engaged in a business or transaction for which our or the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - the guarantor intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond our or its ability to pay such debts as they mature. The Indenture that will govern the notes will limit the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor could incur without risk that its guarantee would be subject to voidance as a fraudulent transfer. However, this limitation may not protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due. A legal challenge to the obligations under any guarantee on fraudulent conveyance grounds could focus on any benefits received in exchange for the incurrence of those obligations. We believe that each of our subsidiaries 13 ----- making a guarantee received reasonably equivalent value for incurring the guarantee, but a court may disagree with our conclusion or elect to apply a different standard in making its determination. A court could thus void the obligations under a guarantee, subordinate it to a guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. The measures of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent transfer laws vary depending on the law applied in the proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it cannot pay its debts as they become due.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the notes and the guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer and the guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding.

Interests in the Global Notes (as such term is defined in “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”) will trade in book-entry form only. Unless and until the notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be the registered holder of the Global Notes. Payments in respect of the Global Notes representing the notes (including principal, premium, interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made to the Paying Agent (as defined below). The Paying Agent will then make such payments to the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary (or its nominee) will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. After payment to the common depositary (or its nominee), we, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a bookentry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of notes under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.” 15 ----- Unlike the holders of the notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, a participant.

Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to us.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150
207_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.9,Selection and Notice,124.9.1,,"If fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or if the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, the Trustee will select on a pro rata basis; provided, however, that no Note in an unauthorized denomination shall be redeemed in part. The paying agent may perform the functions of the Trustee related to the redemptions with respect to the Notes. Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first class mail at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), 26 ----- Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150
207_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.10,Change of Control,124.10.1,,"If a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all of the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder’s Notes pursuant to a “Change of Control _Offer.” In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a “Change of Control Payment” in cash equal to 101% of_ the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. If the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to the Change of Control Payment by the Issuer. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice to each Holder (with a copy to the Trustee) describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes on a certain date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in such notice, which will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Issuer’s compliance with such laws and regulations shall not in and of itself cause a breach of their obligations under such covenant. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer. The paying agent will promptly wire to each holder of Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail, or cause to be transferred by book entry, to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchases or redeems the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. In the event that holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes accept a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer purchases all of the Notes held by such holders, the Issuer will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following the purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all of the Notes that remain outstanding following 27 ----- such purchase at a redemption price equal to the Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding, to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another Person or group may be uncertain. The Existing Credit Agreement provides that certain change of control events with respect to the Company would constitute a default under the Existing Credit Agreement. Any future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuer or the Company becomes a party may contain similar restrictions and provisions and may also prohibit the Company from purchasing any Notes. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer or the Company is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer or the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer or the Company does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under such other agreements. In addition, the exercise by the holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s or the Company’s then existing financial resources. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150

The Suspended Covenants will not be reinstated even if the Company subsequently does not satisfy the requirements set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above. After the Suspended Covenants have been suspended, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall remain subject to the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption “— Change of Control” and described under the following subheadings: - “Limitation on Liens,” - “Merger and Consolidation” (other than the financial test set forth in clause (3) of that covenant), and - “Reports.” If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status or if a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture or the Notes with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability under the Indenture or the Notes for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation entered into during the Suspension Period and not in contemplation of an impending Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to the Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the first and second paragraphs of “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and throughout the Suspension Period; _provided, that, no Subsidiaries may be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (5) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions” and any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described under clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions 29 ----- from Restricted Subsidiaries.” During the Suspension Period, any future obligation to grant further Note Guarantees shall be suspended. All such further obligation to grant Note Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

provided, further, that if the Company elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, (i) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreement is entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition, but any calculation for purposes of other incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect such acquisition until it has been consummated or (b) the date such Indebtedness is Incurred or assumed; and (10) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant). Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

If, with respect to any Asset Disposition, at the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period with respect to such Asset Disposition, there remains Applicable Proceeds in excess of the greater of $50.0 million and 1.5% of Total Assets (such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are equal to the greater of $50.0 million and 1.5% of Total Assets, “Declined Excess Proceeds,” and such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $50.0 million and 1.5% of Total Assets, “Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth below, the Company shall make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) no later than ten business days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to all Holders of Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of such Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to, but not including, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreement governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, with respect to the Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notices of an Asset Disposition Offer shall be sent by first class mail or sent electronically, at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each Holder of the Notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to the Applicable Proceeds by making an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period (the “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, any other Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Disposition Offer made with Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) is less than the amount offered in an Asset Disposition Offer, the Company may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in Declined Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes or, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered pursuant to any Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in euro that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into euro. 44 ----- Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the Company’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other impediment, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Available Cash will be promptly (and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse Tax cost consequence with respect to such Net Available Cash (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Company, the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity partners would incur a tax liability, including a tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding tax), the Net Available Cash so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) or the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $120.0 million; and (ii) 3.0% of the Total Assets of the Company (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. 45 ----- The Existing Credit Agreement prohibits the Issuer from purchasing any Notes and also provides that certain asset sale events with respect to the Company or the Issuer would constitute a default under the Existing Credit Agreement. Any future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Company or the Issuer becomes a party may contain similar restrictions and provisions and may also prohibit the Issuer from purchasing any Notes. In the event an Asset Disposition occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company or the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company or the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (other than a Regulated Bank) (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that have represented to 53 ----- such Holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee and Euroclear and Clearstream shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer may determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation or Verification Covenant and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer or the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation or Verification Covenant, and seeking to invalidate any Default, Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a court of competent jurisdiction has made a determination that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation or Verification Covenant as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration shall be voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the preceding two paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank; provided that if a Regulated Bank is a Directing Holder or a beneficial owner directing Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee it shall provide a written representation to the Company that it is a Regulated Bank. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction, Position Representation, Verification Covenant and Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Regulated Banks, Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action or staying any remedy in reliance thereon. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or to determine whether any Holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the Indenture or any other agreement or whether or not any Holder is a Regulated Bank. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, 54 ----- if any, on the Notes will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or interest) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any fee, loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines, on the advice of counsel or other experts, advisors or agents, is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all liabilities, losses, expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer in writing, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end 55 ----- of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which they are aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer or the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Any time period to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations described above under the heading “—Certain Covenants— Reports” will for the 60 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the principal amount of the Notes at a rate equal to 0.25% per annum. This additional interest will be payable in the same manner and subject to the same terms as other interest payable under the Indenture. This additional interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the date on which an Event of Default relating to a failure to comply with the reporting obligations described above under the heading “—Certain Covenants—Reports” first occurs, if applicable, to but excluding the 60th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to such reporting obligations is cured or waived). If the Event of Default resulting from such failure to comply with the reporting obligations is continuing on such 60th day, such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Notes will be subject to the other remedies provided under the heading “—Events of Default.” The Notes will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150

207_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,327,CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,327.1,Certain Additional Payments,327.1.1,,"We may be required to pay additional amounts in addition to the stated principal amount of and interest on the notes in certain circumstances (e.g., in the case of a change in control as described in “Description of Notes— Change of Control”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of 93 ----- payment of such additional amounts in respect of the notes does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury Regulations. If we become obligated to pay such additional amounts, then we intend to take the position that such amounts will be treated as additional proceeds and taxed as described below under “—Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes.” If we become obligated to pay additional interest on the notes, then we intend to take the position that such amounts will be treated as ordinary interest income and taxed as described below under “—Payment of Stated Interest.” These positions will be based on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the notes, the possibility that additional amounts in redemption of, or additional interest on, the notes will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations. Our determination that a contingency is remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, then the notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. In that case, a United States Holder may be required to accrue ordinary interest income on the notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest on the notes, regardless of its regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, and to treat any gain recognized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes as ordinary income rather than capital gain. Each holder should consult its tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of a note being treated as a contingent payment debt instrument. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150
207_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,327,CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,327.2,United States Holders,327.2.1,,"This summary addresses only United States Holders. As used herein, the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for United States federal income tax purposes: - an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States; - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (ii) in the case of a trust that was treated as a domestic trust under the law in effect before August 20, 1996, a valid election is in place under applicable Treasury Regulations to treat such trust as a United States person. _Payment of Stated Interest_ Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, stated interest on a note generally will be included in the gross income of a United States Holder as ordinary income at the time such interest is accrued or received, in accordance with the holder’s method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. It is anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the “issue price” of the notes will be equal to the stated principal amount or, if the “issue price” is less than the stated principal amount, that the difference will be less than a de minimis amount (as set forth in applicable Treasury Regulations). In the case of a United States Holder that uses the cash method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, the amount required to be included in income will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest received (determined based on the spot rate on the date the payment is received), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at the time. A cash method United States Holder will not recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment of stated interest but may recognize exchange gain or loss upon the later exchange of such payment into U.S. dollars as described below in “—Exchange of Foreign Currency.” 94 ----- In the case of a United States Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, the amount of interest income required to be included will be the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued with respect to the note during an accrual period. In general, the U.S. dollar value of such accrued income will be determined by translating such income at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year. However, a United States Holder may elect (a “Spot Rate Convention Election”) to instead translate such accrued stated interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued stated interest, a United States Holder may translate such interest at the spot rate on the date of receipt. The Spot Rate Convention Election will apply to other applicable obligations held by the United States Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the holder and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A United States Holder should consult its tax advisor as to the availability and advisability of making such election. In addition, upon receipt of an interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or exchange of a note), an accrual method United States Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the interest received (translated at the spot rate on the date such payment is received or the note is disposed of) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income such United States Holder has previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense, except to the extent provided by administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Upon the later exchange of such payment for U.S. dollars, a United States Holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss as described below in “—Exchange of Foreign Currency.” For purposes of this discussion, the “spot rate” generally means a rate demonstrated to the satisfaction of the IRS to reflect a fair market rate of exchange available to the public for currency under a “spot contract” in a free market and involving representative amounts. A “spot contract” is a contract to buy or sell a currency on the nearest conventional settlement date, generally on or before two business days following the date of the execution of the contract. If such a spot rate cannot be demonstrated, the IRS has the authority to determine the spot rate. _Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_ Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, a United States Holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized upon the disposition (which, in the case of any amount received in a foreign currency (e.g. euros), generally will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of such amount at the spot rate on the date of the disposition, or, in the case of a note held by a cash basis taxpayer or an electing accrual basis taxpayer that is traded on an established securities market as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations, at the spot rate on the settlement date), except to the extent such amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxed as described above under “—Payments of Stated Interest”, and (ii) the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. A United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal the U.S. dollar cost of the note to such holder (which, in the case of a note purchased with foreign currency, will be determined by translating the purchase price at the spot rate on the date of purchase or, in the case of a note that is traded on an established securities market as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations, on the settlement date of the purchase if the holder is a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer that so elects). Subject to the paragraph below regarding foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the United States Holder has held the note for more than one year. In general, long-term capital gains of a non-corporate United States Holder are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. United States Holders should consult their tax advisors as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances. In connection with the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, a United States Holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the 95 ----- U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the note, determined at the spot rate on the date the note is disposed of or the payment is received and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the note, determined at the spot rate on the date the United States Holder acquired the note (unless, as noted above, the notes are publicly traded on an established securities market, in which case a cash basis holder or an electing accrual basis holder generally would compute any foreign currency exchange gain or loss by reference to the settlement date of disposition or purchase, as applicable). Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest) will be realized only to the extent of total gain or loss realized on the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition. The special election available to accrual method United States Holders in regard to the purchase and sale of notes traded on an established securities market, discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, must be applied consistently to all debt instruments (as applicable) from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. If an accrual method United States Holder is not able to make or has not made such election, such holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency received (based on the spot rate on the settlement date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized (based on the spot rate on the disposition date). Any such exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense, except to the extent provided by administrative pronouncements of the IRS. _Exchange of Foreign Currency_ On a sale or other taxable disposition of foreign currency (e.g. euros), a United States Holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of U.S. dollars, or the fair market value in U.S. dollars of other property, received by the holder in the disposition and (ii) the holder’s tax basis in the foreign currency. Any such gain or loss will be ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense, except to the extent provided by administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Foreign currency received as interest on a note or on the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note generally will have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value on the date the foreign currency is received or the note is disposed of (except that foreign currency received from the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note that is traded on an established securities market generally will have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value on the disposition date in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer that does not make the election described above). Foreign currency that is purchased will generally have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of purchase. _Reportable Transactions_ A United States Holder may be required to report a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of notes (or, in the case of a United States Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, a payment of accrued stated interest) or the disposition of foreign currency (e.g. euros) received in respect of a note on IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement) if such holder recognizes foreign currency exchange loss that equals or exceeds certain threshold amounts. United States Holders are urged to consult their own advisors to determine the reporting obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 as part of their U.S. federal income tax return. _Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_ In general, certain information must be reported to the IRS with respect to payments of interest on a note and payments of the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a note, in each case, paid to certain non-corporate United States Holders. Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) may apply to such payments, if (i) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor or to establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect; (iii) there has been a notified payee underreporting described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the payee has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS has not notified the payee that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from 96 ----- a payment to a United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against that holder’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. _Additional Tax on Net Investment Income_ Certain United States Holders that are individuals, trusts or estates and that have modified adjusted gross income (or adjusted gross income, in the case of a trust or estate) above a certain threshold may be subject to a 3.8% tax on their “net investment income” (or undistributed “net investment income,” in the case of a trust or estate). A United States Holder’s “net investment income” generally includes, among other things, interest income on and capital gain from the disposition of securities like the notes, subject to certain exceptions. If you are a United States Holder that is an individual, estate or trust, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the applicability of this tax to your investment in the notes. 97 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,150
207_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,327,CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,327.3,Non-United States Holders,327.3.1,,"This summary addresses only non-United States Holders. As used herein, the term “non-United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: - a nonresident alien individual; - a foreign corporation; or - a foreign estate or trust. _Payment of Stated Interest_ Subject to the discussion below of effectively connected income, backup withholding and FATCA withholding, interest paid on a note to a non-United States Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax if such payments qualify as portfolio interest. Generally, the exemption applicable to such portfolio interest applies when: - the non-United States Holder does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote; - the non-United States Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is actually or constructively related to us through stock ownership; - the non-United States Holder is not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and - either (A) the non-United States Holder certifies in a statement provided to us or our paying agent, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a “U.S. person” within the meaning of the Code and provides its name and address (generally by completing an applicable IRS Form W-8 (or relevant successor form)), (B) a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’ securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds the notes on behalf of the non-United States Holder certifies to us or our paying agent under penalties of perjury that it, or the financial institution between it and the non-United States Holder, has received from the non-United States Holder a statement, under penalties of perjury, that such holder is not a “U.S. person” and provides us or our paying agent with a copy of such statement or (C) the non-United States Holder holds its notes directly through a “qualified intermediary” and certain conditions are satisfied. Subject to the discussion below of effectively connected income, backup withholding and FATCA withholding, payments of interest made to a non-United States Holder not satisfying the conditions described above will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% unless an income tax treaty applies to reduce or eliminate withholding and the non-United States Holder provided us with a properly executed applicable IRS Form W-8 (or relevant successor form) claiming the exemption or reduced rate of withholding. Income that is effectively connected with a non-United States Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of the nonUnited States Holder) will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis at the same rates applicable to U.S. persons and, if paid to a corporate non-United States Holder, may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax (or lower applicable treaty rate). If payments are subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis in accordance with the rules described in the preceding sentence, such payments will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax so long as the non-United States Holder provided us or the paying agent with appropriate certification. In order to meet the certification requirement with respect to effectively connected U.S. trade or business income, the non-United States Holder must generally provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI (or any relevant successor form) stating that 98 ----- interest paid on a note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-United States Holder of a trade or business in the United States. The certification requirements described above may require a non-United States Holder that provides an IRS form, or that claims the benefit of an income tax treaty, to also obtain and provide a U.S. TIN. In addition, the certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of interest and must be updated periodically. _Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_ Subject to the discussion below of backup withholding and FATCA withholding, a non-United States Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on gain realized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a note (other than any amount representing accrued but unpaid interest on the note, which is subject to the rules discussed above under “—Payment of Stated Interest”) unless either (i) such gain is effectively connected with the non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of the non-United States Holder) or (ii) the non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met. If a non-United States Holder realizes gain that is effectively connected with such non-United States Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the non-United States Holder will be subject to tax on the net gain derived from the sale or other taxable disposition of the note in the same manner discussed above with respect to effectively connected interest income (and, in the case of a non-United States Holder that is a corporation, may also be subject to the branch profits tax). If a non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition of a note, and certain other conditions are met, then such non-United States Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat rate of 30 percent (unless a lower applicable treaty rate applies) on any such realized gain, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses. _Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_ The amount of interest paid to a non-United States Holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld from such payment generally must be reported annually to the non-United States Holder and to the IRS. The IRS may make this information available under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-United States Holder is resident. Provided that a non-United States Holder has complied with certain reporting procedures (usually satisfied by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption, the non-United States Holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to interest payments on a note, unless we or our paying agent know or have reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person. Rules relating to information reporting requirements and backup withholding with respect to the payment of proceeds from the disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a note are as follows: - If the proceeds are paid to or through the U.S. office of a broker, a non-United States Holder generally will be subject to backup withholding and information reporting unless the non-United States Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption. - If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or that has certain specified U.S. connections, a non-United States Holder generally will be subject to information reporting (but generally not backup withholding) unless the non-United States Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption. - If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is not a U.S. person and does not have certain specified U.S. connections, a non-United States Holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting. 99 ----- Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against the non-United States Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. _FATCA Withholding_ Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (known as “FATCA”) impose certain due diligence, information reporting and withholding requirements, particularly with respect to accounts held through foreign financial institutions. Under these rules, a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax will applies to interest income paid on a debt obligation issued by a U.S. corporation, and, subject to the regulatory relief described below, to the gross proceeds paid from the sale or other disposition of such an obligation, in each case, to (i) a foreign financial institution (including in certain instances where such institution is acting as an intermediary), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury Department to collect and provide to the Treasury Department substantial information regarding U.S. account holders, including certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners, or (ii) a non-financial foreign entity (including in certain instances where such entity is acting as an intermediary) unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or a certification identifying the direct and indirect substantial U.S. owners of the entity. Under certain circumstances, a holder may be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. The United States has entered into (and may enter into more) intergovernmental agreements (“IGAs”) with foreign governments relating to the implementation of, and information sharing under, FATCA and such IGAs may alter the FATCA reporting and withholding requirements. Under proposed U.S. Treasury regulations that may be relied upon pending finalization, the withholding tax on gross proceeds would be eliminated and, consequently, FATCA withholding on gross proceeds paid from the sale or other disposition of a note is not expected to apply. Prospective investors are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in the notes. 100 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,150

This summary deals only with a beneficial owner of the notes (for purposes of this summary, a “holder”) that is either a United States Holder or a non-United States Holder (each as defined below) that purchases the notes in this offering at their issue price (generally, the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for money to the public, not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and that will hold the notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of section 1221 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (generally, property held for investment). This summary does not purport to deal with all aspects of United States federal income taxation that might be relevant to a particular holder in light of its personal investment circumstances or status, nor does it address tax considerations applicable to an investor that may be subject to special tax rules, such as banks or other certain financial institutions, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, tax exempt entities and organizations, S corporations, partnerships or other pass through entities for United States federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities, insurance companies, broker dealers, dealers or traders in securities or currencies or other holders that generally mark their securities to market for United States federal income tax purposes, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid United States federal income tax, expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code, certain former citizens or residents of the United States subject to section 877 of the Code, direct and indirect shareholders, taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax, or taxpayers that acquire the notes directly or indirectly in connection with the performance of services. This summary also does not discuss notes held as part of a hedge, straddle, synthetic security or conversion transaction, does not address tax considerations applicable to accrual-method taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code, and does not address situations in which the “functional currency” of a holder is not the United States dollar. Moreover, the effect of any applicable United States federal estate or gift or alternative minimum tax considerations, or considerations under any applicable tax treaty, state, local, or non-United States tax laws or any tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws are not discussed herein. This summary is based on the provisions of the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), judicial authority, published administrative positions of the United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, each as in effect on the date of this document. Changes in such rules or new interpretations thereof may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect the United States federal income tax considerations discussed below. We have not sought, and do not expect to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached herein and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. The following discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. Investors considering the purchase of notes should consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of the United States federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the federal estate or gift tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-United States taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty or any tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws. In the case of a beneficial owner of notes that is classified as an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, the United States federal income tax treatment of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the notes to a partner of the partnership generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partnership and the partner. Any such partnership or partner of a partnership should consult its tax advisor regarding the United States federal income tax considerations applicable to it relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150

Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note. Any Book-entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-entry Interest.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to be issued notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-entry Interests. In such an event, we will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law. 107 ----- In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the registrar or transfer agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 will be issued.

We may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear and 108 ----- Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear and Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2020,150

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States.
