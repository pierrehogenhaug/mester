##### Paganini BidCo S.p.A.
**€765,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2028**

Paganini BidCo S.p.A., a joint stock company (società per azioni) incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy (the “Issuer”), is offering (the
“Offering”) €765.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”) as part of the financing for the
acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of (i) the entire issued share capital of Wversity S.r.l., an entity incorporated under the laws of Italy (“Wversity” or the
“Target” and the Target, together with its subsidiaries, the “Target Group”) and (ii) the entire issued share capital in Multiversity S.r.l., an entity
incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy (“Multiversity” and Multiversity, together with its subsidiaries, the “Multiversity Group”) and
presently an indirect subsidiary/joint venture investment of the Target and direct subsidiary of Multiversity S.p.A., such that following the Acquisition the
Issuer will own, directly or indirectly, the entire issued share capital of the Target, Multiversity S.p.A. and Multiversity.
The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes at a rate equal to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (with 0% floor), plus (ii) 4.25% per annum, reset quarterly. The
Issuer will pay interest on the Notes quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing on January 30, 2022. The Notes
will mature on October 30, 2028. At any time prior to October 30, 2022, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus the relevant “make-whole” premium. At any
time on or after October 30, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Notes, at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. Upon the
occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have
occurred if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all,
of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof. See “Description of the
_Notes.”_
The Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering on the Issue Date (as defined herein), deposit the gross proceeds
of the Offering into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”). If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined
herein), the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price of each series of Notes will be equal to 100%
of the aggregate initial issue price of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the special
mandatory redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”.
The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is
not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes will not initially be guaranteed. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined
herein), the Notes will be secured by first-ranking security interests (the “Collateral”): (i) on or about the Issue Date on the Acquisition Closing Date, by:
(x) a limited recourse pledge over Paganini Investments S.à r.l.’s (“Paganini”) shares in the Issuer and (y) a limited recourse security interest agreement over
Paganini’s structural intercompany receivables owing to it by the Issuer (if any) and (ii) within 20 Business Days following the Post-Closing Reorganisation
(as defined herein), a limited recourse pledge over Paganini’s shares in Multiversity (to be converted, subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization,
into an S.p.A. (Società per azioni) prior to the Post-Closing Reorganisation). In addition, the Notes will be secured by a first-ranking security interest in the
initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to
the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) (the “Escrowed Property”). See “—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) to be entered into in connection with this_
Offering, in the event of enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after certain parties,
including the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) and counterparties to certain hedging agreements have been repaid in full. In
addition, any future Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances and any future Guarantees and the
Collateral will be subject to legal and contractual limitations. See “Risk Factors —The interests of the principal shareholder may conflict with your interests
_as a holder of the Notes,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” “Description of the Notes—Security” and_
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”
Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the
relevant series of Notes in relation to any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may
be amended or supplemented from time to time) where the Notes are held by a person resident in a country that is not listed in the White List (as defined
below) and otherwise in the circumstances as described in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.”
There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. There is no assurance that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF
Market. The Euro MTF Ma is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (as amended, “MiFIDII”).
This Offering Memorandum constitutes a prospectus for purposes of Part IV of the Luxembourg law on prospectuses for securities dated July 16, 2019.

**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 43 of this Offering Memorandum.**

Price for the Notes: 99.75% plus accrued interest from the Issue Date

We expect that the Notes will be delivered in book-entry form through a common depositary of Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream
Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”) on or about the Issue Date. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.” The Notes will be in registered form in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess of €100,000.
**This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, securities in any jurisdiction where such offer or**
**solicitation is unlawful. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities**
**Act”) or the securities laws of any state of the United States or other jurisdiction, and therefore may not be offered or sold within the United States or**
**to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration**
**requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Notes are being offered and sold in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in**
**reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”), and in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S**
**under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”) other than to retail investors in the European Economic Area. For these purposes, a “retail investor” is**
**defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID**
**II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not**
**qualify as a professional client as defined in point (1) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)**
**2017/1129 (as amended or superseded, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Prospective purchasers are hereby notified that the seller of the Notes may be**
**relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The Notes are not transferable except in**
**accordance with the restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions.”**

superseded), and includes any relevant implementing measure in each member state (“EU Member State”) of
the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer
within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial
Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do
authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the
Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Prohibition of offers to EEA retail investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus
Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering
Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**_Professional investors and ECPs only target market_**

Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of the product
approval process each manufacturers’, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients
only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to
our obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Italy**

The offering of the Notes has not been registered with Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa, the
Italian Securities Exchange Commission (“CONSOB”) pursuant to Italian securities legislation and, accordingly,
no Notes may be offered, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly, nor may copies of this Offering Memorandum
or any other offering circular, prospectus, form of application, advertisement, other offering material or other
information or document relating to the Issuer, or the Notes be issued, distributed or published in Italy, except:

(i) to qualified investors (investitori qualificati), as defined by Article 2, paragraph (e) of the Prospectus
Regulation; or

(ii) in other circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 1 of the
Prospectus Regulation, Article 34-ter of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999, as amended
from time to time, and the applicable Italian laws.

iv


-----

Any offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or distribution of copies of this Offering Memorandum or any other
document relating to the Notes in Italy under (i) or (ii) above must be:

(a) made by an investment firm, bank or financial intermediary permitted to conduct such activities in the
Republic of Italy in accordance with the Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998, as amended (the
“Financial Services Act”), CONSOB Regulation No. 20307 of February 15, 2018, as amended and
Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, as amended (the “Banking Act”); and

(b) in compliance with any other applicable laws and regulations or requirement imposed by CONSOB, the
Bank of Italy (including the reporting requirements, where applicable, pursuant to Article 129 of the
Banking Act and the implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy, as amended from time to time) and/or
any other Italian authority.

Luxembourg. This Offering Memorandum may not be reproduced or used for any other purpose than the offering

advertised.

II of that Annex, or recognized as eligible counterparties in accordance with Article 30 of MiFID II unless they
have entered into an agreement to be treated as non-professional clients in accordance with the fourth paragraph
of Section I of that Annex; or; (b) the offer of the Notes benefits from an exemption from, or constitutes a
transaction not subject to, the requirement to publish a prospectus pursuant to the Luxembourg law dated July 16,
2019 on prospectuses for securities, which has implemented into Luxembourg law the Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 14, 2017 on the prospectus to be published
when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market.

virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information

**INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

Certain statements in this Offering Memorandum are not historical facts and are “forward-looking” within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. This document contains
certain forward-looking statements in various sections, including, without limitation, under the headings
“Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations,” “Industry” and “Business,” and in other sections where the Offering Memorandum includes_
statements about our intentions, beliefs or current expectations regarding our future financial results, plans,
liquidity, prospects, growth, strategy and profitability, as well as the general economic conditions of the industry
and country in which we operate. We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements in
other communications. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals,
strategies, future events, future sales or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions
relating to acquisitions, our competitive strengths and weaknesses, our business strategy and the trends we
anticipate in the industries and the economic, political and legal environment in which we operate and other
information that is not historical information.

Words such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “suggest,” “target,” “intend,” “predict,” “project,”
“should,” “would,” “could,” “may,” “will,” “forecast,” “plan” and similar expressions or, in each case, their
negative or other variations or comparable terminology, are intended to identify forward-looking statements but
are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.

By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and
specific, and risks exist that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not
be achieved. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among other things, those listed under “Risk
_Factors,” as well as those included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. You should be aware that a number_
of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations,
estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors include:

- failure to comply with the various licensing and accreditation requirements in the jurisdictions in which we
operate;

- termination, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of any of our licenses and authorisations, that could
result in the temporary or permanent cessation of the activities being conducted pursuant to such license
and/or authorisation;

- increased competition in the online education market;

- failure to ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity of our IT platforms, which may result in loss or theft of
data;

- risks associated with our ability to respond to technological changes or satisfy future technology demands of
our students;

- failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security;

- risks associated with our ability to protect our intellectual property and being subject to claims by third
parties for infringing on the intellectual property of third parties;

- being unable to attract and retain our faculty, administrators and skilled personnel;

- demand for our services being affected by employment demand, including by the Italian public
administration;

- failure to enroll new students and re-enroll existing students;

- being dependent on continued growth and acceptance of online education;

- risks associated with losing our key management personnel;

- risks associated with negative impacts on the reputation of our institutions and sector;

- risks associated with our dependence upon the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts and
brand reputation;

- risk of being subject to legal and tax proceedings in the ordinary course of our business;

- our reliance on third parties to provide certain services mainly related to orientation of new students;

- risks associated with any change in the timing of tuition fee payments, which could create cash flow issues
for us;

xi


-----

- risks relating to our capital structure that could adversely affect our business and financial position and
preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes, including our substantial leverage and debt
service obligations, incurring substantially more debt in the future, restricting covenants following the
consummation of the Transaction, and material changes in the Italian tax legislation with regard to
deductibility of interest expense on our indebtedness;

- risks relating to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees, including the structural
subordination of the Notes to all indebtedness of the Issuer’s subsidiaries (none of which will guarantee the
Notes), certain provisions under Italian insolvency laws which could be unfavourable to holders of the
Notes, potentially long recovery times for the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the
Collateral, and the entitlement of creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging liabilities
and certain debt incurred in the future to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral in priority to the
Notes.

The risks listed above and those further described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum
are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. New risks emerge from time to time and it is
not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the
extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

We urge you to read carefully the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry and
Market Data” and “Business” for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could affect our future
performance and the markets in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the
forward-looking events described in this Offering Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all.
Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date on which the statements were made.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a
result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Financial** **Information**

The Issuer is a holding company, which was indirectly incorporated by CVC on September 9, 2021 for the
purpose of the Acquisition, has not been involved in any operating activity since its incorporation and does not
hold any material assets or liabilities other than its equity interests in Multiversity S.r.l. and its outstanding
indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transaction, including its indebtedness under the Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, if any. As a result, this Offering Memorandum does not present any
financial information of the Issuer, except for certain limited “as adjusted” financial data presented on a
consolidated basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Acquisition.

The audited financial information of Multiversity S.r.l. (“Multiversity” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries
(the “Multiversity **Group” or “Multiversity”)** and Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. (“Pegaso”) is therefore
presented in this Offering Memorandum. As (i) Multiversity is the ultimate target and will be the surviving entity
and (ii) the Target does not have any operations of its own, the non-disclosure of the Target’s financial
information would not be likely to mislead investors with regard to facts and circumstances that are essential for
assessing the securities.

**_Multiversity_** **_S.r.l._**

This Offering Memorandum includes:

- the English translations of the audited consolidated financial statements of Multiversity as of and for the
period ended December 31, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 prepared in accordance with
the Italian generally accepted accounting principles issued by the Organismo Italiano di Contabilità
(“Italian GAAP”) and which have been audited by EY S.p.A. (the “Multiversity Audited Annual
**Consolidated Financial Statements”). The English translations of the audit reports issued by us are**
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum; and

- the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Multiversity as of June 30, 2021 and for the six
months ended June 30, 2021 (which include comparative figures for the six months ended June 30, 2020),
prepared in accordance with OIC 30 (the “Multiversity Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
**Statements,” and together with the Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Multiversity**
**Consolidated Financial Statements”).**

Multiversity was established on October 1, 2019 and acquired the predecessor business from Multiversity S.p.A.,
including its subsidiaries, on October 28, 2019. Paganini Investments S.à.r.l. acquired a 50% stake in
Multiversity on November 4, 2019 (for a description of the transaction see Summary—The Transactions). As a
result, the income statement for the 2019 Multiversity Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements covers
only the period since inception to the end of the year of Multiversity stand alone as allowed by Italian GAAP, as
the first consolidation date was December 31, 2019. In order to allow better comparability of financial
performance during the relevant period, this Offering Memorandum also includes certain combined unaudited
financial information of Multiversity and its subsidiaries (as described below for the Schedule to Combined
Financial Information) consisting of the combined unaudited income statement and the combined unaudited cash
flows statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “Combined Financial Information”). The
Combined Financial Information is supplemented by a schedule (the “Schedule to Combined Financial
**Information”) which represents the aggregated income statements and the aggregated statements of cash flows**
for the year ended December 31, 2019 derived from the stand-alone financial statements of the following entities,
which were acquired in 2019:

(a) Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l., Universitas Mercatorum, Multiversity, Certipass S.r.l., Università
Telematica Pegaso S.p.A., Pegaso Management S.r.l. and Unimercatorum S.r.l., which have been audited by
EY S.p.A. on a stand-alone basis (the “EY Audited Entities”);

(b) Uniglobal Invest Ltd and Pegaso International Ltd controlled by Multiversity audited on a standalone basis
by other auditors (the “Non-EY Audited Entities”); and

(c) other entities controlled by Multiversity which have not been audited (the “Unaudited Entities”);

The Schedule to Combined Financial Information included in the S-Pages of this Offering Memorandum also
represents the eliminations of intercompany balances with respect to (i) the EY Audited Entities and (ii) the NonEY Audited Entities and the Unaudited Entities. The Schedule to Combined Financial Information is prepared on
the basis of a perimeter consistent with the consolidation area used for the audited consolidated financial
statements of Multiversity as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, except for Benecon S.c.a.r.l.
Consortium which was included in the Combined Financial Information with the equity method (in 2020,
Multiversity, through Pegaso, owned a 63% stake into Benecon S.c.a.r.l. Consortium (as compared to the 20.28%
stake in 2019). In 2020, Multiversity owned a 51% stake in LAF School S.r.l. which was incorporated on July 22,
2020 and is not included in the Schedule to Combined Financial Information.

The English translations of the Multiversity Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the Pegaso
Audited Annual Financial Statements as well as the English translation of the Independent Auditor’s reports
thereon are included in the F-Pages of this Offering Memorandum, and should be read in conjunction with the
relevant notes thereto.

In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of the financial statements
and financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and should consult their professional
advisors for an understanding of, among other things: (i) the differences between Italian GAAP, IFRS, and other
systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how those differences might affect the financial
information included in this Offering Memorandum and (ii) the impact that recent or future additions to, or
amendments of, Italian GAAP, IFRS or other principles may have had or may have on our results of operations
and/or financial condition, as well as on the comparability among or comparability to prior periods.

**Offering Memorandum Last Twelve Months Financial Information**

The financial information of Multiversity Group included in this Offering Memorandum for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021, is calculated by taking the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and
adding to them the difference between the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six
months ended June 30, 2020 (the “LTM Financial Information”).

The LTM Financial Information has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented
in accordance with Italian GAAP, International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), or any other generally
accepted accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This information is not
necessarily representative of our results for any future period or our financial condition for any past date.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures and percentages set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data
presented in millions or in thousands, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the
data in the Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information.

**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

Certain parts of this Offering Memorandum contain alternative performance measures as defined by the “ESMA
Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures” issued by ESMA on October 5, 2015 (“APMs”) which are
non-GAAP measures and ratios and have thereof not been subject to audit or review. Such non-GAAP measures
include: “EBITDA”, “EBITDA Margin”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA margin”, “EBIT”,
“EBIT Margin”, “Adjusted EBIT”, “Adjusted EBIT margin”, “Net Working Capital”, “Net Invested
**Capital”, “Net Financial Indebtedness”, “Capex”, “Operating Free Cash Flow”, “Adjusted Operating Free**
**Cash Flow”, “Cash Conversion”, “Adjusted Cash Conversion”.**

We have included the Non-GAAP Measures because we believe that such measures enable us to assess the
performance of our business and provide investors with additional information to enhance understanding of our
results. These Non-GAAP Measures are based on a number of complex assumptions and have not been subject to
audit or review. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates and key performance
indicators are reasonable, there are inherent challenges in measuring such information. The conditions supporting
our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, and as a result, the assumptions and estimates upon which
the Non-GAAP Measures are based may not be correct. For these reasons, Non-GAAP Measures used should not

xiv


-----

be considered as an alternative to profit (loss), revenue or any other performance measure derived in accordance
with Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting principles nor to net cash provided by operating activities as a
measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as analytical tools over and above the limitations of
any accounting principles performance measures and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for
analysis of the Group’s results as reported under Italian GAAP. Such Non-GAAP measures may include or
exclude amounts that are included or excluded, as applicable, in the calculation of the most directly comparable
measures in accordance with Italian GAAP. Their usefulness is therefore subject to limitations, which are
described below. In particular, other companies in the industry may define the Non-GAAP measures used herein,
differently, which may make it difficult to compare the performance of these entities to the Multiversity
performance based on similarly named measures. These measures may be used by different companies for
different purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. In addition,
the exclusion of certain items from Non-GAAP measures does not imply that these items are necessarily nonrecurring. From time to time, we may exclude additional items if we believe doing so would result in a more
transparent and comparable disclosure.

You should exercise caution in comparing this data to similar measures used by other companies. The
information presented has not been prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting
standards. In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the
reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and will not be subject to
review by the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of
this information.

These measures are not measurements of performance under Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting
principles and you should not consider them as an alternative to profit/(loss) before taxes or profit/(loss) from
continuing operations determined in accordance with Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting principles, or,
as the case may be, or to cash flows from/(used in) operating activities, cash used in investing activities or cash
flow from/(used in) financing activities. These measures are not indicative of our historical operating results, nor
are they meant to be predictive of future results. Therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on this
data.

Non-GAAP Measures should be considered in conjunction with the Multiversity Consolidated Financial
Statements prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP. Although certain of these measures have been extracted
or derived from the Multiversity Consolidated Financial Statements, this data has not been audited or reviewed
by the Multiversity Group’s independent auditors.

These non-GAAP measures and ratios relate to Multiversity. For further information, including definitions and
reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures prepared on a management basis to the most directly comparable
financial measures prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP, see “Summary—Summary Financial Information
_and Other Information—Summary Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

This Offering Memorandum also includes in the S-Pages (i) the unaudited schedule of Adjusted Net Assets of
Multiversity S.p.A. as of June 30, 2021, and (ii) the unaudited schedule of Adjusted Net Assets of Wversity S.r.l.
(the “Target”) as of June 30, 2021. These non-GAAP measures, related to MultiSpA and the Target, are
reconciled with the related assets and liabilities derived from the unaudited accounting records of these
companies as of June 30, 2021. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with such unaudited
assets and liabilities.

**_EBITDA and EBITDA Margin_**

We define EBITDA as the sum of profit after tax, income taxes, value adjustments of financial assets, financial
income and expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses and amortization and depreciation.

We present EBITDA because we believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluate the Multiversity Group’s
operating performance on a consistent basis over time. EBITDA makes the underlying performance of the
Multiversity Group’s business more visible by factoring out depreciation and amortisation, interest income and
interest expenses and income tax expenses. This measure is also commonly used by investors, analysts and rating
agencies to assess performance.

We define EBITDA Margin as the ratio between EBITDA and the value of production and is used by the Group
as a supplemental measure of operating performance.

**_Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin_**

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for write-offs and non-recurring items.

xv


-----

We present Adjusted EBITDA because it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of the Multiversity
Group’s ongoing operating performance and allows us to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons
and benchmark performance between periods. We believe that adjusting for these items that are not directly
related to the operational performance of the Multiversity Group increases comparability and enables a better
understanding of the underlying performance of the Multiversity Group.

We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as the ratio between Adjusted EBITDA and the value of production.

**_EBIT and EBIT Margin_**

We define EBIT as the sum of profit after tax, income taxes, value adjustments of financial assets, financial
income and expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses.

We present EBIT because we believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluate the Multiversity Group’s operating
performance on a consistent basis over time. EBIT makes the underlying performance of the Multiversity
Group’s business more visible by factoring out interest income and interest expenses and income tax expenses.
This measure is also commonly used by investors, analysts and rating agencies to assess performance.

We define EBIT Margin as the ratio between EBIT and the value of production, and is used by the Group as a
supplemental measure of operating performance.

**_Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT Margin_**

We define Adjusted EBIT as EBIT adjusted for non-recurring items and goodwill amortization related to the
initial purchase price allocation.

We define Adjusted EBIT margin as the ratio between Adjusted EBIT and the value of production.

**_Net Working Capital_**

We define Net Working Capital as the sum of inventory, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current and
non current liabilities, including deferred revenue.

We present Net Working Capital because we believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluate our operating
liquidity.

**_Net Invested Capital_**

We define Net Invested Capital as the sum of tangible and intangible assets, net working capital, other non
current assets and liabilities, and investments.

We present Net Invested Capital because we believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluate our investments and
liquidity.

**_Net Financial Indebtedness_**

We define Net Financial Indebtedness as the sum of liquidity and financial indebtedness (current and noncurrent) based on ESMA recommendations 32-382-1138 issued on March 4, 2021. We present Net Financial
Indebtedness because we believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluate its ability to meet its financial obligations
in accordance with ESMA guidelines.

**_Capex_**

We define Capex as the sum of cash outflow from investing in property, plant and equipment and in intangible
assets.

**_Operating Free Cash Flow_**

We define Operating Free Cash Flow as EBITDA less Capex and change in Net Working Capital.

**_Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow_**

We define Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less Capex and change in Net Working
Capital.

**_Cash Conversion_**

We define Cash Conversion as the ratio of (i) the Operating Free Cash Flow; and (ii) EBITDA.

xvi


-----

**_Adjusted Cash Conversion_**

We define Adjusted Cash Conversion as the ratio of (i) the Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow; and (ii) Adjusted
EBITDA.

This Offering Memorandum also includes in the S-Pages “Adjusted Net Assets” as non-GAAP measures that
relate to MultiSpA and the Target.

**_Multiversity S.p.A.’s—Adjusted Net Assets_**

We define Multiversity S.p.A.’s Adjusted Net Assets as the total Net Assets resulting from the unaudited
financial statements, excluding intercompany and out of perimeter assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2021.
Intercompany assets and liabilities include all the balances arising from the transactions with Wversity S.r.l and
Multiversity Group, as well as the balances related to the investments held in Multiversity S.r.l. and Certipass
S.r.l. Out of perimeter assets and liabilities include all the assets and liabilities which do not fall into the
perimeter of the Transactions.

We present Multiversity S.p.A.’s Adjusted Net Assets in order to highlight the net assets’ book values which fall
in the perimeter of the Transactions on top of those relating to Multiversity Group.

**_Wversity S.r.l.’s—Adjusted Net Assets_**

We define the Target’s Adjusted Net Assets as the total Net Assets resulting from the unaudited financial
statements, excluding intercompany and out of perimeter assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2021. Intercompany
assets and liabilities include all the balances arising from the transactions with Company’s subsidiary
(Multiversity S.p.A.) as well as the balance related to the investment in the Company’s subsidiary (Multiversity
S.p.A.). Out of perimeter assets and liabilities include all the assets and liabilities which do not fall into the
perimeter of the Transactions.

We present the Target’s Adjusted Net Assets in order to highlight the net assets’ book values which fall in the
perimeter of the Transactions on top of those relating to Multiversity S.p.A. and Multiversity Group.

**Overview**

**_General_**

Multiversity is the market leader in Italy in the e-learning market by number of enrolled students with a 40%
market share of the Italian online undergraduate higher education market for the 2019/2020 academic year
capturing approximately 3% of the total Italian undergraduate market.[1] It operates two private online universities,
Pegaso and Mercatorum, a certification entity, Certipass and a number of academies as well as an international
lifelong learning higher education institution based in Malta. It delivers its services through a proprietary online
platform that carries out the e-learning contents produced in-house.

Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A., held by Multiversity, is the promoter and supporter of Pegaso,
Multiversity’s primary education institution. Approximately 105,000 students were enrolled in one of Pegaso’s
online courses for the 2020-2021 academic year. Pegaso offers a range of both undergraduate and postgraduate
courses, and in particular, seven undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single
cycle five-year degree and 139 postgraduate master’s courses as well as a number of higher education and
specialization courses for professionals and high school graduates. Pegaso also offers six individual certifications
and gives students the possibility to undertake single examinations for each course module upon payment of a fee
without having to complete the full course.

Multiversity’s other key institution, Mercatorum, is held indirectly by Multiversity through its 66.66% stake in
the share capital of Unimercatorum S.r.l. as the promoter and supporter of Mercatorum, with the remaining
33.33% stake in Unimercatorum S.r.l. is held indirectly by Unioncamere. Unioncamere, the Italian Union of
Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and Agriculture, is the public body that unites and institutionally
represents the Italian system of chambers of commerce. Approximately 23,000 students were enrolled in
Mercatorum for the 2020-2021 academic year. Mercatorum’s core offering currently consists of 14
undergraduate bachelor’s degrees (two of which are newly accredited and are therefore being offered for the first
time in the 2021/2022 academic year), four specialist master’s degrees, one Ph.D. and 11 postgraduate master’s
courses. Like Pegaso, it also allows students to undertake single examinations for any course module offered
within its curricula.

Other assets of Multiversity include Certipass, as provider of international certifications for digital competences
and IT skills, and an ever-growing number of academies established through collaboration agreements between
Pegaso and Mercatorum and their respective commercial partners, covering a wide range of specialist subjects
such as marketing, communications and media and teaching. In addition, Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l. (“Principe
**di Napoli”) was established in February 2019 by Pegaso in partnership with Mercatorum (holding 90% and 10%**
stakes, respectively) as a center for higher education and specialization in the sectors of gastronomy and tourism.
Apart from the Postgraduate School in Legal Professions (as further described below), Principe di Napoli is one
of the few institution within Multiversity to hold on premise courses.

Multiversity also operates a publishing entity and companies dedicated to research, which are mostly ancillary
and in support of the two universities. Almost the entirety of its operations are located in Italy, with some limited
operations in Malta. It also has collaboration agreements with several partners in Italy for the development and
delivery of specialized courses in a multitude of subjects, made available through its two universities.

In order to support their online offering, Multiversity’s institutions have an extensive network of approximately
3,000[3] e-learning center points as at September 30, 2021 across each of Pegaso (the “ELCP Points”),
Mercatorum (the “Ei-Points”) and Certipass (the “EIPASS Points” and, together with ELCP Points and
Ei-Points, the “ELCPs”). The ELCPs provide information to prospective and current students about the various
institutions, and in particular, Pegaso and Mercatorum’s ELCP Points and the Ei-Points, among other things,
serve as orientation centers for new students throughout the entire duration of the course they undertake. The
ELCP Points and the Ei-Points performed orientation activities for approximately 60% of Multiversity’s
institution’s new students, however the relevant institution retains the direct relationship with student as it
manages the enrollment process and tuition fee payments directly with the student[4]. As regards Certipass’
EIPASS Points, these purchase EIPASS cards from Certipass and on-sell them to customers who wish to obtain
an EIPASS certification. All ELCPs are managed by external third parties that have entered into specific
accreditation agreements with Pegaso, Mercatorum or Certipass (in some cases, more than one institution has
entered into an accreditation agreement with the same ELCP). See “Material Contracts—Accreditation
_Agreements for ELCPs” below._

**_Business Model_**

Multiversity’s business model is based on a student-centric offering of a flexible learning experience and access
to teaching content through our proprietary and technologically advanced e-learning platform. Both Pegaso and
Mercatorum address a specific unmet demand in the market for a flexible path to an undergraduate degree, whilst
catering to specific professions for postgraduate continuous learning.

Revenues are mainly driven by tuition fees paid by students to Pegaso and Mercatorum, which contributed to
77%[5] of Multiversity’s revenues. The levels of tuition fees in turn depend on the number of students, the nature
or class of degree undertaken, the year of enrollment, the type of course and the student’s selected enrollment
channel, amongst other factors. Undergraduate degrees, which are multi-year courses (three year bachelor’s
degree plus a two year specialist master’s degree, or a single-cycle five year degree), are a recurring multi-year
revenue stream for the term of the program (consisting of both the tuition fees and any other ancillary fees),
which has an average course length of 2.8 years. Approximately 40% of graduates from Pegaso and Mercatorum
who have completed three year undergraduate degree courses wish to continue their education and apply to enroll
in two year specialist master’s degree and master’s degree courses with the same institution. Undergraduate
tuition fees accounted for 54% of Pegaso’s revenues and 80% of Mercatorum’s revenues in the financial year
ended December 31, 2020, and 62% of Pegaso’s revenues and 85% of Mercatorum’s revenues for the six months
ended June 30, 2021.

On the other hand, one-year postgraduate master’s courses (i.e. second level master’s which may be undertaken
by students who have already completed a three year undergraduate bachelor’s degree plus a two year specialist
master’s degree or a single-cycle five year degree) together with Multiversity’s FIT offering (i.e. teacher training
courses) provide a one-off tuition fee payment per student, accounting for 20% of Pegaso’s revenues and 4% of
Mercatorum’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 and 12% of Pegaso’s revenues and 6%
of Mercatorum’s revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Various other services offered to students
provide additional revenue such as fees payable in order to take examinations in an alternative location, and
certificates—such additional services accounted for approximately 20% of Pegaso’s revenues and 8% of
Mercatorum’s revenues, in each case for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 and 26% of Pegaso’s
revenues and 11% of Mercatorum’s revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Single exams contributed
to 4% of Pegaso’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with 3%. for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 (whereas single exams generally contribute less than 1% towards Mercatorum’s revenues).

Multiversity’s growth strategy is based on expanding volumes by increasing market penetration within the
population, whilst selectively increasing its course offering, its brand awareness, digital marketing practices and
_ad hoc orientation services to prospective students as well as by entering into commercial agreements and_
partnerships falling into two main categories:

- agreements with corporations, law enforcement, governmental bodies and public administration authorities
providing for the application of lower corporate rates to their employees (and, in certain instances, their
family members) and, in some cases, for the creation and implementation of employee training programs,
thereby incentivizing such employees to attend courses in order to accelerate their career paths or to comply
with the ongoing professional development requirements set up by regulators or employers; and

- partnerships with private companies and public entities aimed at the development of specialized courses
using the partners’ know-how and branding, coupled with Multiversity’s online e-learning platform,
teaching know-how and, in certain instances, its academic staff. These agreements give rise, for example, to
the specialist academies forming part of Pegaso and Mercatorum’s higher education offering, as further
described below.

Multiversity has established a nation-wide presence, with Pegaso’s approximately 100 exam venues located in
prestigious or historical buildings, Mercatorum’s leveraging of the system of the Italian chambers of commerce
and the institutions’ network of approximately 3,000 ELCPs, along with a strong online social community and
proprietary technology platforms for online classes, exams and tutoring.

The main objective underpinning Multiversity’s business strategy is to consolidate its market position and
become the leading entirely online education group in the Italian markets, employing both Business-to-Consumer
and Business-to-Business marketing strategies in order to target an ever-wider audience of students. See further
“—Key Strengths” and “—Strategies” below.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Education and training is a large, resilient, underpenetrated market with strong fundamentals, particularly in_**
**_online segment_**

Global education and training is a large market, currently valued at over $5.0 trillion[6], and it is expected to grow
steadily across the whole spectrum, given significant white space and the need for re-skilling of a significant
portion of global population, mainly due to the digital evolution and the new competencies required (“Lifelong
Learning”).

Online education still represents a relatively small portion overall of the larger global education market, with an
estimated global online penetration of 3.6%[7] in 2020. However, the online education segment has and is expected
to continue to show strong growth, having outpaced traditional physical education growth in recent years whilst
progressively gaining market share and unlocking unaddressed areas of demand. This growth is expected to
continue, and in particular subcategories such as higher education, supplemental business–to-consumer (“B2C”)
and corporate training are expected to accelerate on the back of COVID-19, which has hastened the adoption of
online learning and resulted in an acceleration of online academic offerings.

The global education market as a whole has historically grown at a slow but steady pace and has proven resilient[8]
through economic cycles, including the financial crisis. Future growth in this market is expected to be supported
by several strong structural trends, including: (i) continued student population growth globally and economic
expansion; (ii) a growing professional class willing to supplement formal education; (iii) rising levels of
participation in education; (iv) the need for employee re-skilling and (v) global investments to further advance
education and digitalization.

Undergraduate enrollment in Italy has proven resilient over time, displaying a counter cyclical correlation with
economic cycles and historically experiencing an increase in enrollments during economic downturns.[9]

Online universities have been the main contributor to the growth in undergraduate enrollment since they began
operating in the Italian market in 2006. More recently, the number of Italian first-timers (new university students
who have never been enrolled in university programs) and total students enrolled both maintained their growth[10],
in spite of the adverse impact to Italian GDP as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Italy, the overall undergraduate market—encompassing both traditional and online programs—grew steadily
at a 1% CAGR[11] over the past four years, reaching a total of 1.8 million students in the 2019-2020 academic
year, with enrolment expected to surpass the 2.0 million mark by the 2025-2026 academic year. The primary

beneficiary and driver of this growth in the undergraduate population was the online segment, which showcased a
20% annual growth rate between the 2015/2016 and 2019/2020 academic years, while the number of students
enrolled in traditional universities has remained substantially flat over the same period. Similar trends are
expected to continue, with the online segment anticipated to grow at an annual growth rate of 19% from the
2019/2020 through the 2025/2026 academic years, driving overall market growth even as enrolment at traditional
universities is expected to remain flat.

A lower percentage of degree holders and a gap in digital skills versus other industrialized peers means that Italy
has the potential to benefit disproportionately from these trends as it seeks to close the gap—both in terms of
education and digitalization—versus its European peers. Italy stands at 27.7%[12] (vs. 44.9% for OECD) in terms
of average population holding a degree and ranks fourth to last versus other developed countries in the DESI
digitalization index[13]. The higher education and skills gaps vis-à-vis populations in peer nations represent a
significant growth opportunity for online education in Italy, and in particular those programs specializing in
digital skills training.

Due to its aging workforce, Italy is also expected to require a large number of graduates across multiple
disciplines in the next five years, totalling nearly 900,000 in expected new hires according to Unioncamere[14].
Specifically with respect to the disciplines in which Multiversity focuses, the expected need over this period is
for approximately 120,000 graduates in Economics & Business Administration, 120,000 in Engineering, 105,000
in Teaching and Training and 90,000 in Law.

_Demand for graduates in the Italian job market_

The postgraduate market has grown even faster than the undergraduate market, experiencing a CAGR of 17%
from the 2015/2016 to the 2019/2020 academic years and reaching 96,000 students in the 2019/2020 academic
year. Over the same period, growth in online postgraduate enrollment, which already exceeds that of traditional
channels, was a CAGR of 30%. Postgraduate growth is expected to continue at a double-digit CAGR through the
2025/2026 academic year, driven primarily by the continued increase in the adoption of online education.

In addition to these secular long-term trends, growth in the online undergraduate and postgraduate education
markets, which comprise the Multiversity Group’s core addressable markets, has been buoyed by recent shortterm catalysts, including the COVID-19 pandemic which accelerated adoption of online channels, as well as
improving sentiment regarding online universities among prospective students. COVID-19 has boosted overall
internet penetration to levels significantly exceeding pre-crisis (e-commerce, e-health, e-learning), also including
the demand for online education. This has resulted in a pronounced short-term spike in expected growth which,
over the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 academic years, is expected to be more than double the annualized growth
rate expected from 2022/2023 to 2025/2026 (projected 28% over 2020/2021-2021/2022 academic years as
compared to 14% over 2022/2023-2025/2026 academic years, annual growth rates for the Italian online

undergraduate enrolled base). Students’ improving perception of online universities has been a key factor in
recent growth, as illustrated by the 83% of students[15] currently enrolled in online universities who think that the
quality of teaching they receive is on par, if not better, than that of traditional universities. This favorable
impression is also validated by employability statistics that put online universities slightly above mid-sized
physical universities among top employers selecting applicants[16] (over a period of 12 months, 8.6% of students
from online universities went to one of the top 50 employers in Italy, vs. 8.5% for mid-sized universities).

A rising proportion of Italian high school students is expected to be interested in attending an online university,
on the back of increasing perceived strength of their online education offerings. The proportion of first-timers
(new university students coming from high school who have never enrolled in university) is expected to increase
to 47% of new students in the 2025/2026[17] academic year as compared to 39% today in 2019/2020 and 33% in
2015/2016. Students are attracted to a model that they feel better suits their needs thanks to inherent flexibility,
more friendly study experience and better support, alongside lower costs (especially when considering costs
ancillary to education such as accommodation and travel).

_Structural tailwinds_

The education market has demonstrated steady and resilient growth on the back of various structural tailwinds:

- **Historical population growth and economic expansion: increasing population globally and economic**
growth will naturally expand the addressable market with an increasing number of people willing to get a
formal education;

- **Emerging middle class willing to supplement formal education: the middle class in particular sees**
education as an enabler of personal growth and wealth, thus making it likely to supplement formal, basic
education with additional courses;

- **Rising levels of participation in education: overall participation in education is rising, reflecting a need**
for skilled workforce globally due to trends in industrialization and modernization that have automated
many of the processes that previously employed unskilled workers;

- **“Lifelong learning”: even a skilled and educated labor force is likely to require additional skills training**
due to the speed of digital evolution and the implied new competencies required. Recently, due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, these programs have largely been restricted to online channels;

- **Government investments to increase levels of education: recognizing higher education as an indicator of**
citizens’ wealth, governments globally are investing in increased access to education in an effort to meet the
Sustainable Development Goals (“SDG”) 2030 Agenda: (i) ensuring inclusive and equitable quality
education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all and (ii) promoting continuous, inclusive and
sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.

Online education also benefits from the specific tailwinds inherent to a delivery model that provides access to
people that could not otherwise participate full time or afford to attend a traditional, physical university. Onlinespecific tailwinds in education include:

- **Increasing online penetration reaching new potential students: online education unlocks an addressable**
market by reaching previously underrepresented parts of the population, either due to economic or logistical
reasons;

- **Government investments in digitalization: focus on digitalization efforts with dedicated funds (i.e.**
€49.2 billion for Italy alone in the latest European Recovery Fund focused on digitalization of public
administration and of the industrial sector[18]);

- **Younger generations’ desire for higher education: new generations value both quality education and**
flexible career paths, which online universities offer, thanks a better-suited consumption model, especially
for part-time students;

- **Lower overall costs: not requiring costs for attending physical lessons (e.g. housing, transport, cost of**
living), online education is generally more affordable than traditional one and accordingly appeals to a
growing share of the population that desires an education but could not otherwise afford to attend a
traditional university;

- **Tapping unmet demand: online education offers to people who historically have not been able to obtain a**
university degree, or are currently working, programs addressing their demand for a more flexible path to a
degree;

- **Highly Scalable Supply: constrained by the practical limits of in-person education, traditional universities**
will struggle to meet increasing demand for graduates globally, while online universities’ business model is
highly scalable and can increase capacity as needed, leveraging existing platform without additional
required large investments in infrastructures.

_Current sentiment for online universities_

A market study conducted by a third-party commercial advisor (the “Third Party Commercial Advisor”)[19]
highlighted an overall very positive market sentiment towards online universities, which it found were
considered highly comparable to traditional ones from a teaching perspective. Of the respondents currently
enrolled in online universities, 83% consider teaching from online universities to be on par with, if not better,
than traditional universities, and this view is shared by 62% of respondents interested in online universities.[20]

A key differentiating point for enrollment in online universities is the perceived increased flexibility and time
saving according to 56% of enrolled students, with a faster academic path, higher university support and lower
overall cost being other key factors. The study also illustrates how the online education platform offered by
online universities is perceived of higher quality due to its “native” nature vs. online/ hybrid education models
offered by traditional channels.

Employability of online university graduates is on average in line with the levels registered in mid-size or largesize traditional universities: among graduates who switched jobs in the 12 months between January 2020 and
January 2021, 8.6% were hired full time by the top 50 Italian employers[21] from online universities, compared to
8.5% for graduates from mid-sized traditional universities and 9.5% for graduates from large-sized traditional
universities in the same time frame.

Pegaso, the largest and most widely known of Multiversity’s online universities, has the broadest academic reach
(with seven undergraduate degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single-cycle five-year degree and over
250 higher education / specialization and postgraduate master’s courses), offering courses across a variety of
disciplines including law, engineering, economics and literature, among others. Mercatorum, while smaller than
Pegaso, is best placed to capture emerging educational trends in fields such as design, food, big data and
sustainable mobility on the back of its strong ties to the territory and business communities, leveraging the
partnership with the Italian Chamber of Commerce (owner of a 33% stake in Mercatorum) and a highly tailored
offering (14 undergraduate degrees, four specialist master’s degrees and one PhD programme[22]). Finally, other
assets, such as Certipass (international certifications for digital competencies and IT skills), Principe di Napoli
and the academies, complement the breadth of the Multiversity portfolio and support the increasing
diversification of the business with no overlapping of educational contents between the two online universities.

The effectiveness of Multiversity’s business model also resides in its distribution platform, which allows it to
retain full and direct contact with students over the course of their enrollment through the control of distribution
and quality of education content. Students can be oriented directly by the universities or by the E-learning Center
Points (“ELCPs”). The ELCPs network of approximately 3.000[23] local affiliates guarantees Multiversity a
capillary presence all over the country, offering (in the case of Pegaso and Mercatorum) information and
orientation assistance and (in the case of Certipass) EIPASS Certifications and related services to new potential
students with a variety of different academic profiles, interests and backgrounds. This local presence throughout
Italy allows flexibility of strategy to adapt to future market changes as well as proximity to students. All ELCPs
are managed by external third parties that have entered into accreditation agreements with Multiversity’s
institutions. See “Business—Material Contracts—Accreditation Agreements for ELCPs.”

_A) Undergraduate market_

Multiversity enjoys a strong leadership position in the online undergraduate market, with a market share of circa
40%[24] as of academic year 2019/2020, more than two times bigger than the number two player in the online
undergraduate education universe. Leveraging on its ability to address a broad market with a unique quality offer,
year over year Multiversity has consistently gained market share in the undergraduate education segment,
becoming leader in the academic year 2017/2018 and, since then, consolidating its prominent position.
Multiversity’s share of this market has grown by 19.2% over the past four years, and has captured an estimated
over 55% of total market growth from academic year 2015/2016 to academic year 2019/2020.

The online undergraduate market is concentrated around the top five players, which represented ~90% of the
combined student population in academic year 2019/2020 and captured the majority of recent growth.

The landscape of key online universities active in the Italian undergraduate market includes:

 - **Multiversity, through its two universities Pegaso and Mercatorum, has a leading market share in the online**
Italian market, with a combined market share of approximately 40% in the academic year 2019/2020
(Pegaso: 34.7%, Mercatorum: 5.2%). Multiversity Group’s market share has increased since academic year
2015/2016 by 14.4% for Pegaso and 4.8% for Mercatorum. Pegaso has by far the most extensive capillary
network in the market and charges average annual tuition fees of €1,800[25];

 - **Università Niccolò Cusano (“Cusano”) is the second-largest player, with a market share of 18.6% in**
academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 10.1% since academic year 2015/2016.
Cusano charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €3,000[25];

 - **E-Campus Università (“e-Campus”) is the third-largest market player with a market share of 15.0% in**
academic year 2019/2020, representing a market share gain of 2.8% since academic year 2015/2016.
E-Campus charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €3,200[25];

 - **Università Telematica Internazionale Uninettuno (“Uninettuno”) is the fourth-largest market player**
with a market share of 11.2% in academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 4.1%
since academic year 2015/2016. Uninettuno charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €1,600.

 - **Guglielmo Marconi (“Marconi”) is the fifth-largest market player with a market share of 7.5% in**
academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 7.5% since academic year 2015/2016.
Marconi charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €1,760[25].

_B) Postgraduate master’s market_

The postgraduate master’s market accounts for approximately 5% of the total higher education market, as
opposed to 95% for the undergraduate market (95.0% in academic year 2019/2020). The online postgraduate
market is concentrated but is similarly concentrated around five top players collectively representing almost 90%
of the combined student population in academic year 2019/2020 and who have gained 21.6% in market share
from all other competitors in the past 4 years. Furthermore, the top two players, Multiversity and e-Campus,
together account for around 76% of the market, with e-Campus gaining the leading position over the last three
years.

The landscape of key online universities active in the postgraduate master’s market includes:

 - **e-Campus is the market leader, with a market share of 45.1% in academic year 2019/2020, a significant**
increase over the past three years considering that in academic year 2016/2017 it only had a market share of
2.3%;

 - **Multiversity is the second-largest player with a combined market share of approximately 31% in academic**
year 2019/2020 (Pegaso 29.4%, Mercatorum 1.6%). While doubling its enrolment in absolute terms over the
past four years, Pegaso, like all other key players aside from Mercatorum, experienced a decline in market
share since academic year 2015/2016 due to the strong growth of e-Campus (Multiversity Group’s
combined market share declined by 13.2% over this period). Multiversity benefits from a unique partnership
with the public sector thanks to the direct participation of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, which holds a
circa 33% stake in Mercatorum;

 - **Cusano is the third-largest player with 9.8% market share in academic year 2019/2020, having conceded**
6.2% in market share since academic year 2015/2016;

The Italian university market, initially closed to online universities, was officially opened to online competition
in 2003 with a ministry decree in an effort to improve the percentage of Italian population with a higher
education degree (one of the lowest of Europe). Since the opening of the online Italian higher education market
in 2003, 11 private online universities were established, with online universities enrolling their first students in
2006. There are no public online universities and the online university market is structurally closed to new
entrants, as no further licenses are currently expected to be issued. In particular, the restriction for the
establishment of online universities in Italy is usually extended every 3 years, with the publication of the
Ministerial Decree governing Italian universities’ academic planning. The latest Ministerial Decree published in
March 2021 (Decree n. 289 of 25 March 2021) confirmed the restriction until the academic year 2023/2024.

As a result of the restriction on the establishment of new online universities, barriers to entry are particularly high
for any potential new entrant, whether domestic or from abroad. Even if the restriction were to be lifted,
prospective market entrants would face significant upfront investments, in terms of time and resources, to catch
up with established online players, like Multiversity, that has already established a nation-wide presence,
superior technological platform, well-recognized brand and significant scale.

Traditional universities have historically limited their focus and investments in online education platforms as a
result of various factors:

 - **Structural complexity of a hybrid education model: arising from the coexistence of traditional and online**
learning for the courses being offered and organizational complexity and teaching methodology change not
easy to replicate. There might also be resistance to change from academics, which tend to favour traditional
university teaching compared to online methods;

 - **Infrastructural gaps and investments required: given the geographic concentration of university facilities**
(generally in a single city, sometimes even a single campus/building) they lack the nationwide exam venues/
network reach of online universities. Furthermore, the need for IT investments to adapt the business models
is significant, both in terms of economic resources, as well as time and technical capabilities. Decisions over
these matters typically take longer times in traditional universities, in particular for public-owned
universities, given strategic agendas which do not prioritize online education and budget constraints;

 - **Perceived risks around potential brand dilution: for some of the most prominent names in the traditional**
education space, given the different offer and target markets.

-----

During the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional universities were forced by the circumstances to offer online
classes, but this is seen as only a temporary solution, with some already returning to forms of traditional
education in the academic year 2021/2022. Most importantly, traditional universities cannot offer a permanent
online solution without Ministry approval.

**_Compelling customer proposition, with capillary presence across the country and iconic venues_**

Online universities offer a value proposition capable of meeting the needs of a growing population seeking
higher education but dissatisfied with a traditional university learning experience and service delivery. The key
elements characterizing online universities’ value proposition are: (i) a “student-centric” learning experience;
(ii) convenience; (iii) equivalent legal value of degree (in most cases at a lower cost); (iv) extensive physical
network and iconic venues in city centers; (v) effective commercial strategy and (vi) credibility and
employability with employers.

Flexibility and convenience are the most important differentiating factors for students, chosen by 56% of
respondents as the main reason for preferring online versus traditional universities based on a survey of 800
current students of online universities. Another key reason, growing in importance, is the lower overall cost, as
distance learning removes a prominent barrier for many prospective students: the need to move to a different
location to attend university (thereby saving travel and accommodation costs).

These attributes have allowed online universities, like Multiversity, to unlock a market otherwise inaccessible via
traditional channels, catering to students that require flexibility (such as, for example, full-time workers) or that
considered university inaccessible due to costs (such as travel and accommodation costs).

The superior quality of Multiversity’s business model is evidenced by Pegaso’s “Net Promoter Score,” a grade
delivered by actual students for the quality of its online deliver. Pegaso’s NPS is the highest in the market, with
46%[26] of respondents happy to recommend Pegaso to a friend. This NPS favorably compares to 25% for the
number two player, and an overall average of 15% for all other online universities.

Student Centric Learning Experience

A key element distinguishing online universities from traditional universities is the high degree of flexibility. Not
only can students follow courses online from anywhere; they can also choose to attend their exams in multiple
venues across Italy, in up to 12 different exam sessions per year. Traditional universities, on the other hand, only
offer exams in one primary location, in up to 4 exam sessions per year.

Online universities also offer a more student-friendly study experience. Lessons can be followed from anywhere
via the online platform, with video-recorded classes lasting c. 25-30 minutes each, available 24/7 to students.
Study packs are provided for each lesson, as well as numerous online mock exams. The offering is
complemented by flexible additional services, such as dedicated tutors, online chat client and specific forums for
both students and professors. Traditional universities, by contrast, generally only offer lessons on campus, with
fixed schedules lasting 1-2 hours, and classes are usually not recorded. Specific textbooks are required, while the
supporting materials and mock exams are often limited. Office hours are fixed and must be booked in advance,
making communication between students and professors more difficult.

Beyond encompassing all of the key advantages common to online universities, Multiversity’s offering in
particular overperforms competitors thanks to its unique physical presence across Italy, including approximately
100 iconic exam locations, and a superior proprietary technological platform and contents.

More convenient alternative

Online education platforms offer students significantly decreased all-in costs of education versus traditional
universities. Tuition fees are aligned to those of competing public traditional universities, however since courses
can be attended remotely there is no need for students to acquire or rent accommodation to be close to the
university (that is often one of the most sizeable and prohibitive implicit costs of university attendance) or pay
for transit. Moreover, students can realize significant savings on course materials, given that all study materials
are made available online and are included in the tuition fee. In traditional universities, by contrast, the primary
source of information used in courses is physical textbooks, which students often need to purchase at significant
cost.

Multiversity’s pricing is highly competitive, both among other online universities and, to an even higher extent,
when compared to traditional universities. Pegaso, for example, offers an average undergraduate preferential
tuition fee per year of circa €1,800, compared to circa €3,000 per year for Cusano and e-Campus.

Officially recognized degree and equivalent legal value university degree

The degrees are accredited, have the same legal value and are verified in the same way as public and private
universities degrees in Italy by the MIUR.

The Italian national agency for the evaluation of university and research systems (Agenzia Nazionale di
_Valutazione del Sistema Universitario e della Ricerca or “ANVUR”) periodically inspects online and traditional_
universities to evaluate their services and provide them with an official accreditation. Pegaso and Mercatorum
received top marks among online competitors in their latest accreditation visits in 2017.

Multiversity’s wide and robust quality offering is continuously innovated through new courses (such as Big Data
approved for Mercatorum) to adapt to changing trends and needs. Multiversity’s reputation and brand awareness
has benefited from the experience and breadth of its academic staff, which includes 76 full and associate
professors (university professor holding a chair hired indefinitely), 155 extraordinary professors (experts on the
specific research development sector), 479 contract professors (discipline expert with renewable annual
assignment), 16 researchers (scholar of specific research fields) and 88 tutors developing cutting-edge proprietary
content. Among its speakers and guests, Multiversity has hosted a breadth of personalities including former
ministers, general secretary of the largest Italian labor union and award-winning film directors and screenwriters.

Capillary Physical Network and Iconic Venues

Proximity and ease of access to local infrastructure are key determinants for students when choosing between
traditional forms of higher education and online and, within the latter, selecting one university over another.

Multiversity enjoys a unique presence in Italy thanks to Pegaso’s approximately 100 iconic exam locations in the
most important Italian cities and a difficult to replicate network of approximately 820 Pegaso and 800
Mercatorum ELCPs located throughout the country.

The numerous locations across Italy allow students to sit for exams close to their home cities. The use of iconic
buildings as exam centers is also a contributor to establishing strong brand recognition with a unique positioning
and brand awareness, not only among the students’ population, but also among all the members of academic
staff.

The large E-learning Center network of affiliates guarantees Multiversity a capillary presence across the country,
offering orientation services and information to new potential students with a variety of different academic
profiles, interests and backgrounds. This local presence throughout Italy allows flexibility of strategy to adapt to
future market changes and proximity to students.

Effective commercial approach across traditional and online channels

Unlike their traditional counterparts, online universities generally display a more committed approach towards
marketing and advertising, engaging with potential and existing students both online and via traditional channels
such as billboards, television and radio. Multiversity has developed a particularly strong position across the
spectrum, thanks to a well-developed multi-channel marketing strategy coupled with its capillary nationwide
network.

-----

Pegaso shows a higher social media following than most of online and traditional competitors, on the back of
strong student engagement. This level of interaction was aided in part by targeted advertising with exclusive
partners, such as a co-branding campaign with the movie Spider-man: Homecoming in 2017, and by airing TV
spots during peak times, for example during widely-followed shows in Italy.

The effectiveness of Multiversity online marketing strategy is particularly relevant when considering the
increasing penetration of first time students in the Italian online higher education channel, with such category—
by nature, given the younger age - being more receptive and used to online forms of advertising vs. traditional
ones.

Additionally, Pegaso and Mercatorum have established and consistently grown their unique network via
framework agreements with more than 1,500 associations including public bodies, trade unions, the Chamber of
Commerce, municipalities, cultural associations, private companies and sports associations. This network is over
six times larger than any of the key competitors’ and continues to grow, with approximately 350 new agreements
concluded by Pegaso in the last year alone, 1.6 times the number of total agreements that the second player in the
market had in 2020. These framework agreements are fundamental to Multiversity’s business model, as they
increase the possibility to secure a captive customer base.

Credible and Valid Access to Top Quality Employers

Multiversity’s strong link with the Italian Chamber of Commerce (through its stake in Mercatorum) allow
Multiversity’s students to be best positioned to meet Italy’s future employment needs. Multiversity’s offering is
tailored to respond to the future demands of the Italian job market. The latest estimates by Unioncamere relating
to employment needs between 2020 and 2024 predict that almost 900,000 graduates will find a job between 2020
and 2024. Specifically, in the fields in which Multiversity offers degree and other programs, the expected need
will be circa 120,000 graduates in Economics & Business Administration, circa 120,000 in Engineering, circa
105,000 in Teaching and Training and circa 90,000 in Law, collectively accounting for approximately 50% of the
total projected demand.

_Demand for graduates in the Italian job market and Multiversity offer[28]_

Multiversity single courses, including FIT (courses related to anthropo-phsycho-pedagological disciplines for
students striving to become 2nd grade teachers), FORM, and Single Courses, are aligned with Public
Administration hiring trends through “Concorso Pubblico” (i.e. public hiring tenders that require a specific

exam). These hiring trends were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing public tenders by
60-70%[29] compared to previous years, but a rebound is expected as these tend to be recurring hiring tenders over
the years. Through 2025, Unioncamere expects the need to hire 740,000 new employees into public
administration, either to replace workers who are retiring (93%) or for new positions (7%).

**_When assessing post-degree job opportunities, Multiversity benefits from both online sector and company-_**
**_specific trends._**

An analysis by a Third Party Commercial Advisor among the top 50 Italian employers shows similar
employability rates among online and traditional university graduates. Specifically, the percentage of online
university graduates that switched jobs over the last 12 months and were hired full-time by one of the top 50
Italian employers was on average 8.6%[30] as of June 2021. This is 0.1% higher than graduates of mid-sized
universities and only 0.9% lower than large universities. The comparable employment rate among online
university graduates supports the credibility and validity of online education as an alternative higher education
offer, which is expected to increase its overall appeal and spur demand across different segments of online
universities’ overall addressable market.

Compared to other online universities, Pegaso had the largest overall market share among online universities,
equal to 33% of graduates hired in the past 12 months by the top 50 employers in Italy. According to a survey of
1,000 respondents[31], Pegaso’s graduates find jobs in: (i) Public Administration (20% of total alumni); (ii) top 50
Italian employers and large companies (16%); iii) as independent professionals (17%) and (iv) small/medium
enterprises (47%). In addition, Multiversity is the market leader in terms of its graduates being hired in the
energy and utilities, financial services and industrial sectors[32].

**_Proprietary technological platform and content with superior user experience_**

The technological platform developed by Multiversity over the years differentiates it versus competitors and
constitutes a high barrier to entry for any prospective new player. User experience has been at the center of the
development of this cutting-edge IT platform, hosting approximately 130,000 students over the 2020/2021
academic year, which was digital from its inception (versus traditional universities that are playing catch up with
online platforms). Students are able to access all video lessons, class materials and mock exams; interact via
video conference with professors and tutors; and even attend exams online, all through user-friendly Pegaso and
Mercatorum websites or mobile apps (first launched in 2018). Superior user experience is also at heart when
Multiversity creates its content for these platforms: while professors create the content, they are supported
throughout by Multiversity IT staff who ensure that materials produced are optimized to be deployed across all
its channels. Multiversity is currently serving one of the largest online student communities in Italy and has a
broad social network presence to further engage with its students.

The company has developed its platform mostly in-house or by personalizing open-source software, achieving a
strong back-end able to deliver seamlessly across all platforms and devices. Multiversity has also fully
transitioned its business to cloud-based servers provided by Amazon Web Services’ (“AWS”) cloud datacenters,
and currently hosts 150 terabyte/month of data storage and relies on a multi-server system, with a load balancer
to manage user traffic overload. This cloud structure adds an additional disaster recovery horizontal layer
(through AWS) to the existing redundant copy stored in the company’s Multimedia Centre in Naples.
Multiversity’s platform, in addition to leveraging the latest technology available such as facial recognition to
confirm student identity, offers advanced proprietary features such as a suggestion tool for its students (enabled
by artificial intelligence and machine learning) that prompts highly relevant content to each individual based on
their career path, grades and progress.

Quality of the IT platform is recognized by students compared to peers and traditional universities, demonstrating
students are highly satisfied with the technological tools at their disposal.

**_Attractive financial profile, with visible revenue, a scalable business model and high cash-flow conversion_**

Multiversity, benefiting from the positive structural tailwinds described above, was able to outpace its reference market
(thanks to the specific strengths of its business model), with Pegaso in particular growing its revenue at a CAGR of
27% from 2018 to 2020. In the academic years 2018/2019-2019/2020, the number of students grew by 22% for the
overall online market.

This growth was embedded with a certain amount visibility, as undergraduates (whose courses have a longer
duration) and freshmen (the vast majority of which stay with Multiversity up to completion of their degrees) had
a significant incidence on overall figures. In particular, undergraduate courses at Multiversity have an average
duration of 2.8 years and a strong conversion rate (40% of graduates from 3-year degree programs apply for 1- or
2-year master’s degrees). In addition, with Multiversity Group churn rates below those of the broader online
market (approximately 5% vs. 6%[33]), the potential negative impact on the overall student base from early exits is
limited, granting additional stability. The average backlog for Pegaso in academic years 2017/2018-2020/2021
was approximately 55%.

These dynamics are of particular relevance given that approximately 55% of the Group’s 2020 revenues were
generated from undergraduate programs, thus allowing valuable visibility on future top-line evolution.

Operating leverage is high, on the back of a significant business model scalability. In particular, the variable
component of our cost base is only related to the contributions recognized to the E-learning Centre Points, which
grow as the business grows. For instance, during the year ended December 31, 2020, contributions recognized to
the E-learning Centre Points accounted for 13% of our total revenues (and 26% of our total cost base), whereas
the advertising costs represented 14%, educational and didactic personnel costs were 4%, headquarters and nondidactic personnel costs were 6%, rental costs were 2% and we recorded 9% of our total revenues for other
expenses. As such, and given the asset-light nature of our business—with investments concentrated our around
IT platform—as our business grows, profitability and cash-flow based metrics are expected to grow more than
proportionally.

**_Significant opportunity to grow beyond the existing perimeter, without significant investments_**

Given Multiversity’s existing leadership position in online higher education, we expect to continue benefitting
from the sector’s structural tailwinds. Not only is the market expected to be larger in absolute size (reaching
379,000 undergraduate students in academic year 2025/2026[34] out of a total addressable base of approximately
1,000,000 individuals, vs. 135,000 as of academic year 2019/2020); it will also benefit from a different mix in
terms of levers of growth, both from a geographic and student profile perspective.

In particular, there is significant geographic white space to be addressed, especially in the Italian Northern
regions. While originally Southern Italy has seen the largest number of undergraduate students, strong growth in
the online undergraduate market will come from the Italian Northern regions, increasing from circa 27% of the
total undergraduate online student base to circa 34% in academic year 2025/2026, adding circa 60,000 new
students and doubling the current absolute number.

In addition, first-timers—which have been the highest growth category over 2015/2016—2019/2020 academic
years, with a 32% CAGR—will continue to increase their relative incidence versus overall undergraduate student
base, moving from 33% in academic year 2015/2016 to 47% expected by academic year 2025/2026.

Multiversity in-house skills and know-how allow the Group to benefit from several opportunities for additional
growth beyond its existing perimeter without the need for significant investments. These opportunities include
B2B and continuous learning, becoming a technology provider and international expansion.

B2B and continuous learning

There are significant opportunities to put the technological platform at the service of a number of prospective
clients for a variety of potential needs. In particular, the pandemic forced many companies to implement distance
learning initiatives for their employees.

Multiversity is already equipped to tap this opportunity through its proprietary technology platform and in-house
content. Leveraging our technological capabilities and the know-how and capabilities of our academic staff,

Multiversity could offer customized platforms, content and innovative learning programs for companies or
specific industries, coupled with our nationwide capillary presence through which we can also offer in-person
lessons.

Technological platform—“White Label”

Multiversity’s proprietary platform and in-house technological capabilities could also be exploited as a product to
be sold to third parties. In order to avoid potential conflicts of interests or providing competitors with our
technology, this offering could be tailored to K-12 or traditional universities addressing distinct student
populations.

International expansion

Although organic international expansion is rendered difficult by divergent regulatory environments and
requirements which reduce our ability to replicate or scale our model, there are potential opportunities in selected
international markets where Italian degrees are relevant and attractive. In particular, we are currently developing
an offering in Turkey, and will selectively expand to other countries by leveraging the same content and platform
to international students seeking an Italian degree recognized across the European Union.

**Business Strategy**

We consistently focus on the following elements of our strategy to maintain and strengthen our position as one of
the leading Italian online technology focussed educational groups.

**_We continue to deliver accessible education to students, addressing their needs and contributing to_**
**_democratising higher education learning_**

We believe our commitment to the provision of a high quality online educational experience to our students is the
foundation of our operating performance and growth.

We will continue to offer our students flexibility and constant support throughout their academic careers, an
excellent educational path and a cutting-edge platform, all with a compelling economic proposition. All of this is
possible as we recruit and retain experienced and highly qualified teachers and constantly refresh proprietary

We intend to continue our strategy by attracting, retaining and investing in teaching professionals and prominent
Italian experts across various disciplines, all while delivering superior content. In this context, we believe
research plays a key role; our goal is to support our staff with the means and tools to continue to produce updated
content and publications.

We will allocate adequate financial resources to further enhance our tech platform, particularly in cybersecurity,
to support the protection of remote students while maintaining a high standard of service.

In line with the 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”), we remain loyal to our
commitment to ensure an inclusive and fair quality education, to promote opportunities of continuous learning
for everyone and sustainable and inclusive economic growth, facilitating access to honorable job opportunities
for everyone.


20


-----

**_Continue to deliver educational content through a superior user experience and technology platform,_**
**_investing in improving academic quality and maintaining brand awareness_**

Providing our students with a superior experience is at the core of our operations.

To achieve this goal, we will leverage our cutting-edge technological platform and continue improving our web
and mobile applications, with the aim of delivering educational content in the most streamlined, intuitive and
efficient manner as possible. Our IT staff will support our professors to ensure that all content is optimised for
deployment across our various delivery channels and guaranteeing the best possible online academic experience
to our students.

We also intend to continue investing in the back-end of our technological platform to ensure the highest quality
of service. We plan to further improve our cybersecurity operations, as protecting our remote students from
potential risks remains a key priority for us. We intend to continue our roll-out of the most up-to-date
technologies, including facial recognition and artificial intelligence software.

In addition to further developing our technology, we also remain committed to constantly improving the quality
of our academic offering and adapting it to market demand.

We believe that the constant improvement of our digital-born platform and academic offering, coupled with our
commitment to ensuring flawless delivery across all channels, will contribute to maintaining and reinforcing our
brand awareness.

**_Increase enrollment by focusing on segments with unmet demand_**

On the basis of our leadership position and the quality of our offering, we believe we are best positioned to tap
the significant white space in the Italian market, especially in the undergraduate segment. In an effort to address
the widest possible audience with our unique proposition, we will focus on optimizing our marketing and
advertising initiatives (including our presence on digital and traditional channels), strengthening our ELCPs
network and expanding our commercial partnerships.

A high level of student satisfaction is key for us and something we are highly committed to, as it translates into
higher retention rates and, consequently, a higher number of years students spend at Multiversity. We are
strongly convinced in the evolution of the market towards a “continuous learning” model; the more we are able
to retain our students and address their needs, the greater the chance that they will return to Multiversity for their
future educational needs.

**_Maximizing operating and financial performance_**

We continuously monitor and evaluate our operational performance to identify opportunities for enhancement
and to capitalize on embedded growth.

We continue to place significant emphasis on managing our costs efficiently, benefiting from higher operating
leverage and maintaining operational flexibility.

We also seek to consistently generate tuition fee growth above cost inflation—supported by the growing demand
for online education, our strong reputation and the quality of our educational offer—in order to grow our revenue
and expand our margins.

**_Pursue opportunity to grow selectively beyond the existing perimeter, leveraging existing in-house capabilities_**

We will continue to assess and develop opportunity beyond the existing perimeter, such as B2B and continuous
learning, becoming a technology provider, and international expansion.

**Recent Developments**

**The Transactions**

On November 4, 2019, Paganini Investments S.à r.l., a Luxembourg company indirectly controlled by CVC
(“Paganini”), acquired from Multiversity S.p.A. (“MultiSpa”) 50% of the share capital of Multiversity through
wholly equity financed investment.

Paganini also acquired 50% stake of the share capital of Certipass S.r.l. (“Certipass”). The remaining 50% of the
share capital of Multiversity has been indirectly held by an Italian individual (the “Seller”) and on June 20, 2021
Paganini entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire the remaining 50% of the share capital of
Multiversity from the Seller (the “Acquisition”).

We currently expect the Acquisition to complete on October 28, 2021 (immediately following the Issue Date), as
a result of which the Issuer will acquire (i) the entire issued share capital of Wversity S.r.l., an entity incorporated
under the laws of Italy (“Wversity”) and (ii) the entire issued share capital in Multiversity (together, such
investments being the “Multiversity Investment”) such that, at completion of the Multiversity Investment, the
Issuer will own, directly or indirectly, the entire issued share capital of the Multiversity. Following the
Acquisition, Multiversity will also own 100% of Certipass.

In connection with the Multiversity Investment, (i) the Issuer will enter into a bridge to cash facility agreement
(the “Bridge to Cash Facility Agreement”), which will be used to partially fund the Multiversity Investment
(the “Bridge to Cash Facility”), (ii) the Issuer will enter into a super senior revolving credit facility (the
“Revolving Credit Facility”) and will draw €38.7 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) CVC
indirectly made a cash equity contribution to the Issuer in the aggregate amount of €41.8 million (the “Equity
**Contribution”) through injections into Paganini Holdings S.à r.l. (“LuxCo”) and Paganini.**

The gross proceeds of the Offering, are €763.1 million. On the the Acquisition Closing Date, the proceeds of the
Offering, the Bridge to Cash Facility, amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Equity
Contribution will be used by the Issuer to fund the Multiversity Investment and to pay the estimated costs and
expenses associated with the Transactions (as defined below). See “—Sources and Uses” and “Use of Proceeds.”

We refer to the Multiversity Investment, the Bridge to Cash Facility, the entering into the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Equity Contribution and the Offering and any actions or steps related to the foregoing,
collectively as the “Transactions.”

Following completion of the Multiversity Investment, the Issuer, Wversity and MultiSpa will merge into
Multiversity under a reverse merger (the “Post-Closing Reorganisation”) with the surviving entity being
Multiversity. Following the Post-Closing Reorganisation, Multiversity will assume the obligations of the Issuer
under the Indenture, the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Subject to certain Agreed Security
Principles (as defined herein), sufficient guarantors will accede within 120 days of the earlier of (a) the PostClosing Reorganisation and (b) the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date such that entities
contributing 80% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group (and each Material Company (being each


22


-----

contributing 5% or more of Consolidated EBITDA of the Group on an unconsolidated basis) located in
Guarantor Jurisdictions (as defined herein) become, subject to Agreed Security Principles, guarantors, see
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility—Guarantees”. In addition, security
is to be granted (subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant
limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any
_notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law”) over the shares in any additional borrower_
under the Revolving Credit Facility (including on a limited recourse basis if the relevant shareholder is not a
guarantor), and any Material Company or other member of the Group located in a Guarantor Jurisdiction which
becomes a guarantor of the Revolving Credit Facility is required (subject to and in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles and certain limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations—Limitations on Granting Security Interests and Guarantees under Italian Law”) to grant_
security over shares in any Material Company that is its wholly-owned subsidiary and (if wholly owned by other
members of the Group) to have its own shares (or equivalent ownership interests) secured in favor of the Security
Agent (including on a limited recourse basis if the relevant shareholder is not a guarantor). For the avoidance of
doubt, no security shall be granted by (or over the quota in or loans made to) Target or MultiSpA.

**_Escrow Account_**

The Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering on the Issue Date, deposit the gross
proceeds of the Offering into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”). The release of the escrow proceeds
will be subject to certain conditions, including completion of the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is not
consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption. The special mandatory redemption price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate initial
issue price of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to
the special mandatory redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption”._

The escrowed funds will be limited to the gross proceeds from this offering of the Notes, together with any
earnings thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid
interest on each series of Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to our Capital Structure—If the Offering closes prior to the consummation of the_
_Multiversity Investment, if certain conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the_
_Issuer will be required to redeem its Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the_
_Notes and the escrowed funds may not be sufficient to cover the special mandatory redemption price”._

**_Sources and Uses_**

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the
table below. Actual amounts on the Acquisition Closing Date will vary from estimated amounts depending on
several factors, including differences from our estimate of fees and expenses. This table should be read in
conjunction with “Summary—The Transactions”, “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

indirectly, the refinancing of certain existing indebtedness (if any) of
the Target or its subsidiaries. For more information on the Italian law

companies, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees and Certain Insolvency_

_Guarantees—The Collateral and any future guarantees or security of_
_the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and_
_may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that_
_may limit their validity and enforceability.” For the avoidance of_
doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at identifying the
separate portions of the proceeds being used to consummate the
Acquisition and the various elements of the refinancing of the Group
Existing Debt, respectively, and will not entail issuing separate
identifiers (ISINs or common codes) for each such tranche. See
“Listing and General Information.”

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the

redemption. The special mandatory redemption price of each series of
Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate initial issue price of
such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, and additional
amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the special mandatory
redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption”._

The escrowed funds will be limited to the gross proceeds from this
offering of the Notes, together with any earnings thereon and
investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any
accrued and unpaid interest on each series of Notes that may be
payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to our Capital Structure—If the Offering_
_closes prior to the consummation of the Multiversity Investment, if_
_certain conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow_
_Longstop Date, the Issuer will be required to redeem its Notes, which_
_means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes and_
_the escrowed funds may not be sufficient to cover the special_
_mandatory redemption price”._

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Acquisition Closing Date, which will be immediately following
the consummation of the Offering, the proceeds of the Offering, the
Bridge to Cash Facility, amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the Equity Contribution will be used by the Issuer to fund
the Multiversity Investment and to pay the estimated costs and
expenses associated with the Transactions. See “Risk Factors”.

**Optional Redemption: . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or after
October 30, 2022 at the redemption prices as described under

of Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
to the date of redemption plus a “make-whole” premium, as described
under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor
in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee will be
made without withholding or deduction for taxes in any relevant
taxing jurisdiction unless required by law. Subject to certain
exceptions and limitations, if the Issuer, any Guarantor or the
paying agent is required by law to withhold or deduct such taxes
with respect to a payment on any Note, such Issuer or Guarantor
will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount
received by each holder after such withholding is not less than the
amount that would have been received in the absence of the
withholding.

The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy and
therefore payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in
certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to
Italian tax laws and regulations. Subject to and as set forth in
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will not
be liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes if
any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be
amended or supplemented from time to time) (“Decree No. 239”) or
pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21,
1997 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to
time) (“Decree No. 461”), except, in the case of Decree No. 239 and
Decree No. 461, where the procedures required under Decree
No. 239 or Decree No. 461, as applicable, in order to benefit from
an exemption have not been complied with due to solely the actions
or omissions of the Issuer or its agents. See “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_

Although we believe that, under current law, Italian substitute tax will
not be imposed under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 where a
holder of Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country which allows
for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy included in the
list provided for by Italian Ministerial Decree dated 4 September
1996, as amended from time to time, or, as from the tax year in which
the Ministerial Decree to be issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, let.
c) of Decree No. 239 is effective, included in the list therein provided
(the “White List”) and such holder of Notes complies with certain
certification requirements, there is no assurance that this will be the
case. Moreover, holders of the Notes will bear the risk of any change
in Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 after the date hereof, including
any change in the white list countries. See “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Prospective purchasers of Notes should_
consult their tax advisors as to the overall tax consequences of
acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes and receiving payments
of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes, including,
in particular, the effect of any state, regional or local tax laws of any
country or territory.

**Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction are
announced and become effective on or after the issuance of the Notes
that would require the Issuer or the Guarantors (if any) to pay
additional amounts (as defined in “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes”), the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but_
not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

-----

**Change of Control** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the
Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the outstanding
Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to the date of purchase. However, a change of control will not be
deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio
is not exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of
_the Notes—Change of Control.”_

**Certain Covenants** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                         - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                         - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
investments;

                         - make certain other restricted payments;

                         - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                         - impose restrictions on the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to
pay dividends;

                         - transfer or sell certain assets;

                         - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                         - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                         - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if the relevant Notes
obtain and maintain an investment-grade rating.

Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The
Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. See
“Transfer Restrictions.” We have not agreed to, or otherwise
undertaken to, register the Notes under the securities laws in any
jurisdiction (including by way of an exchange offer).

**No Established Market for the**
**Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have
advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not
obligated to do so and they may discontinue market making at any
time without notice. Accordingly, there is no assurance that an active
trading market will develop for the Notes.

**Listing** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Application has been made to admit the Notes on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro
MTF Market thereof in accordance with the rules thereof. There is no
assurance that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed and admitted to
trading on the Euro MTF Market.

**Risk Factors** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. You should consider
carefully all the information in this Offering Memorandum and, in
particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set forth in the
“Risk Factors” section before making a decision whether to invest in
the Notes.

(1) We define EBIT as the sum of profit after tax, income taxes, value adjustments of financial assets, financial income and expenses,
foreign exchange gains and losses.

We present EBIT because we believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluate the Multiversity Group’s operating performance on a
consistent basis over time. EBIT makes the underlying performance of the Multiversity Group’s business more visible by factoring out
interest income and interest expenses and income tax expenses. This measure is also commonly used by investors, analysts and rating
agencies to assess performance.

(2) We define EBIT margin as the ratio between EBIT and the value of production and is used by the Group as a supplemental measure of
operating performance.

(3) We define EBITDA as the sum of profit for the period, income taxes, effects of investments using the equity method, financial income
and expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses and amortization and depreciation.

(4) We define EBITDA Margin as the ratio between EBITDA and the value of production and is used by the Group as a supplemental
measure of operating performance.

(5) We define Adjusted EBIT as EBIT adjusted for goodwill amortization and non-recurring items

(6) We define Adjusted EBIT margin as the ratio between Adjusted EBIT and the value of production and is used by the Group as a
supplemental measure of operating performance.

(7) We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for bad debt accruals and non-recurring items.

Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may
be limited. Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP Measure and the term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under Italian GAAP, IFRS or any
other generally accepted accounting principles. Consequently, the use of Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. We present Adjusted
EBITDA because it excludes items that the we do not believe are indicative of the Group’s ongoing operating performance and allows us
to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods. We believe that adjusting for
these items that are not directly related to the operational performance of the Group and increases comparability and enables a better
understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income, operating income,
operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with Italian GAAP or IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you
should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or
liquidity measure that is calculated in accordance with Italian GAAP or IFRS. For a more detailed description of the limitations of
Adjusted EBITDA as analytical tool, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

(8) We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as the ratio between Adjusted EBITDA and the value of production.

Furthermore, we define Aggregated Adjusted EBITDA as the sum of Adjusted EBITDA and the remaining 50%
Adjusted EBITDA of Certipass (which is consolidated using the proportional method and therefore the remaining
portion is not included in our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2021 since we
own only a 50% stake in Certipass).

(17) We define Net Financial Indebtedness as the sum of liquidity and financial indebtedness (current and non-current) based on ESMA
recommendations 32-382-1138 issued on March 4, 2021. We present Net Financial Indebtedness because we believe it is a meaningful
measure to evaluate its ability to meet its financial obligations in accordance with ESMA guidelines.

The following table shows certain alternative performance measures calculated with regard to the last twelve
months ended June 30, 2021 as adjusted to give pro-forma potential effects of the Transactions, as if each of
these Transactions had occurred on June 30, 2021, for the purposes of the consolidated statement of financial
position, and as of July 1, 2020, for the purposes of the consolidated income statement.

Such alternative performance measures presented in this Offering Memorandum are based on available
information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. They are presented for illustrative purposes
only and do not purport to represent what the financial condition or the actual results of operations would have
been if the events for which the pro forma adjustments were made had occurred on the dates assumed, nor do
they purport to project our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.
Our future operating results may differ materially from the pro forma amounts set out in this Offering
Memorandum due to various factors, including changes in operating results. Such pro forma alternative
performance indicators set forth herein and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum have not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S–X under the Exchange Act. Neither the adjustments nor the
resulting pro forma financial information have been audited or reviewed.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors in the Notes should carefully_
_consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum before_
_making a decision to invest in the Notes. Any of the following risks, individually or together, could have a_
_material adverse effect on the Issuer’s business, financial position, results of operations and prospects, and_
_accordingly the value of the Notes or on the Issuer’s ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. This section_
_describes the risks and uncertainties that the Issuer believes are material, but these risks and uncertainties may_
_not be the only ones that it faces. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those of which the Issuer is_
_currently unaware or those which it deems immaterial, may also result in decreased sales, assets and cash_
_inflows, increased expenses, liabilities or cash outflows or other events that could result in a decline in the value_
_of the Notes, or which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of_
_operations and prospects and thus on its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. The order in which the_
_risks are presented does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude of their_
_potential impact on the Issuer’s business, financial position, results of operations and prospects or on the trading_
_price of the Notes. There are no specific risks related to Wvesrity S.r.l. . The operations of the Company are run_
_on the Group level by Multiversity and all risks that are relevant for the Group are applicable for Wversity S.r.l._

**Risks Related to the Group’s Business and Industry**

**_Multiversity is subject to various licensing and accreditation requirements in the jurisdictions in which it_**
**_operates, and its failure to comply with these requirements could expose Multiversity to financial losses and_**
**_lead to loss of qualified personnel and students._**

Multiversity’s activities are subject to extensive regulation and obtaining and maintaining authorizations.
Individual courses offered by Multiversity’s academic institutions are also subject to various accreditation
requirements. In order to operate, Multiversity’s academic institutions have received and maintained various
accreditations and permissions from the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (“MIUR”), as
well as from certain curriculum providers and examination bodies.

The accreditation system envisaged by the regulations provides that all courses forming part of an institution’s
educational offering, except master’s courses, must be licensed every three years, and the relevant institution
must undergo a review process every five years in order to maintain its licensing. The procedure for obtaining
and maintaining the relevant license varies depending on whether the course is newly created or already existing.
See “Regulation” for further information.

As a prerequisite to obtaining and maintaining specific licenses for each course, an institution must itself have
obtained its general license to operate from the MIUR.

To maintain these accreditations and permissions, Multiversity’s Italian academic institutions must meet standards
relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, staff,
administrative capability and resources. In particular, Pegaso and Mercatorum, as Italian private universities, are
subject to a periodic accreditation assessment carried out by the Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of
Universities and Research Institutes (Agenzia Nazionale di Valutazione del Sistema Universitario e della Ricerca or
“ANVUR”), the entity to which the MIUR has delegated the task of carrying out a periodic qualitative assessment
of the activities carried out by Italian universities and research institutes. The periodic accreditation assessments are
processed following on-site visits to universities by an ad hoc commission of experts appointed by ANVUR. The
periodic accreditation process is carried out in three phases: (i) a remote examination of the documentation made
available by the university to the commission, (ii) the actual on-site visit in order to examine the degree programs
and the departments selected by ANVUR for each university, and (iii) the drafting of a report by the commission.
For further information on the legislative framework and licensing and accreditation process to which Multiversity’s
academic institutions are subject, please see “Regulation”.

Depending on the outcome of ANVUR’s periodic accreditation assessment, a negative score could be assigned to
Pegaso or Mercatorum, which in turn could lead to the revocation of their authorizations, in the event that Pegaso
or Mercatorum is unable to improve its score as a result of continuing material weakness following subsequent
reassessment. Inspections could also lead to downgrading of the rating assigned to any of Multiversity’s
academic institutions. Any such event could result in the temporary or permanent cessation of all or part of
Multiversity’s business and/or a reduction of the academic institutions’ ability to enroll new students or attract
qualified personnel. Multiversity’s reputation would also be severely impacted.

In addition, the jurisdictions in which Multiversity operates (being, as at the date hereof, almost exclusively Italy
and, to a limited extent, Malta, although Multiversity degrees are recognized across the European Union) may at
any time impose additional laws, regulations or licensing requirements on online academic institutions, or even

43


-----

on academic institutions in general. Such new laws could oblige Multiversity or Multiversity’s individual
institutions to obtain additional licenses, permits or accreditations, which could in turn lead it to incur significant
costs, limit or delay its ability to operate and/or to expand its business in such jurisdiction in line with its strategic
objectives. In addition, in the event that compliance with such legislative changes were to be deemed too
operationally or financially burdensome by Multiversity, Multiversity could cease to operate in the relevant
jurisdiction altogether.

In particular, Pegaso was the first university in Italy to become a limited company and commercial entity. At the
time of Pegaso’s transformation into a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) in 2019, both
the Italian Council of State (Consiglio di Stato) and the MIUR issued favourable opinions on the matter, without
raising objections to the specific transaction in the absence of any express legislative provision to the contrary.
Both authorities however noted in their opinions that existing legislation does not expressly regulate the status of
universities as private corporations, and that this could, impact how the regulatory framework is applied to open
universities that take the form of private corporations. The authorities therefore called for the government to
consider proposing legislative reforms in order to exclude the risk of encountering incompatibility issues in the
practical application of the current legal framework to corporations. It cannot be excluded that the authorities
could in the future consider legislative proposals in order to update the legal framework. Were such reforms to be
passed into law, it cannot be excluded that Pegaso, as the first university to transform into a private corporation,
could be required to comply with enhanced legal requirements or to implement organisational or structural
changes, thereby potentially facing increased costs and hindering its ability to conduct its current business
effectively. In addition should any further universities of the Group be similarly transformed, they would face
similar uncertainties. See further “Regulation—Establishment of Pegaso and Mercatorum” and “Regulation—
_Transformation of Pegaso into a private corporation”._

**_Any termination, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of any of Multiversity’s licenses and authorisations_**
**_could result in the temporary or permanent cessation of the activities being conducted pursuant to such_**
**_license and/or authorisation, impact its ability to enroll new students, adversely affect Multiversity’s_**
**_reputation or cause it to incur unanticipated costs. Any of the circumstances described above are likely to have_**
**_a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**
**_Regulatory changes and investigations may be driven by political and public opinion affecting providers of_**
**_higher education._**

The success of Multiversity’s business depends significantly on compliance of its subsidiaries (including its
academic institutions) with legislation and oversight by the MIUR, mainly through ANVUR. The regulation of
alternative providers of higher education in Italy is, to a significant degree, subject to political and public opinion
on the role of the private sector in the provision of education. This may lead to the implementation of policies
that promote the preferential treatment of publicly-funded higher education providers over private universities or
higher education institutions’ ability to recruit students, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on
Multiversity’s business and results of operations.

Although Multiversity has stringent procedures in place to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations to
which it is subject, if other alternative providers abuse the system, Multiversity’s reputation may be negatively
impacted by association, thus leading to a negative impact on Multiversity’s business and financial position. See
also ‘‘—Any negative impact on the reputation of Multiversity’s institutions and sector could adversely affect its
_business’’ below._

In addition, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities in Italy or in any other jurisdiction in which
Multiversity operates will not impose restrictions on the level of tuition fees charged by its universities in the
future or any other material changes in the applicable requirements to Multiversity’s operations. Changes in such
regulations, which can often occur at short notice, could have a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, the cost structure and the business model of
Multiversity. If the regulatory framework governing the levels of tuition fee is altered in a manner which
negatively impacts Multiversity’s tuition fee structure, its operating margins and prospects could be adversely
affected.

**_Increased competition in the online education market could reduce enrollments, increase Multiversity’s cost_**
**_of student and staff recruitment and retention and put downward pressure on Multiversity’s revenues and_**
**_profitability._**

The online education market in Italy has significant entry barriers and is effectively closed to new entrants (see
“Regulation—The Regulatory Context of Online Universities”). Pursuant to the legislative framework in place as
at the date of this Offering Memorandum (specifically and most recently, Italian Decree no. 289 of March 25,
2021 (as may be amended or replaced, “Decree 289”)), no new licenses can be granted in order to incorporate

44


-----

new online universities. Currently in Italy, eleven online universities have been authorised by the MIUR. The
prohibition on the granting of new licenses has been in place for over ten years.

Decree 289 has a duration of three years, and will last until academic year 2023/2024. Should it not be extended
or replaced by a similar law after such time, or should the broader legislative framework be amended at any point
in time in order to repeal Decree 289, allowing the granting of further authorizations to new online institutions,
Multiversity would face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market,
including, for example, established colleges and universities that had not previously offered an online education
program.

Multiversity may be unable to compete successfully against future market players (for example, if Multiversity is
unable to differentiate its educational offering from those of its competitors) and may therefore face difficulties
in maintaining or increasing tuition fee levels and enrolling, retaining students and staff, thereby increasing its
expenditure in student and staff recruitment and retention activities. In addition, Multiversity’s institutions may
face increased difficulties in locating and engaging third parties as e-learning centers, thereby limiting or
reducing its geographical presence across Italy. Furthermore, Pegaso and/or Mercatorum could lose their market
leadership position in the face of new competition, with a knock-on effect on their reputation. These competitive
factors could cause Multiversity’s enrollment figures, revenues and profitability to materially decrease.

**_If Multiversity is not able to ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity of its IT platforms, or fails to adequately_**
**_maintain and develop its IT platform, it could suffer loss or theft of data and risk breaching regulations, as_**
**_well as affecting the user experience of its students._**

Multiversity has continuously invested in its proprietary IT platform and systems in order to deliver among the
most advanced online learning platforms on the Italian market. The platform does not run on external software or
rely on external technology and is fully owned by Multiversity. The platform was developed mostly in-house in
reliance on open-source software and is run on servers hosted by Amazon Web Services’ cloud datacenters.

Although Multiversity has established and maintains cybersecurity frameworks that are developed and updated
internally, including a system that monitors the platform and code transactions on it, its IT systems and platforms
may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, data corruption,
network or server failure, computer viruses, security breaches, data theft or leak of confidential information such
as exams content or exam results, natural disasters, third-party intrusions or other technical malfunctions despite,
where possible, efforts to prevent such damage or interruption. As a result, Multiversity’s business could be
disrupted if any of the technologies that Multiversity uses to deliver its programs are interrupted or fail. See
“Business—Technology Platform” for further details.

Multiversity’s business model is entirely reliant on the proper functioning of its e-learning platform and, more
generally, of its IT systems. If Multiversity is unable to continue to maintain or update its IT platform, it may
have difficulty delivering its online services. In addition, any failure to deliver its online services would have an
adverse impact on Multiversity’s operations, damage its reputation and limit its ability to attract and retain
students. Any damage or malfunction to any of these technologies may require capital expenditure to rectify and
would necessarily cause delays in Multiversity’s operations. Any material disruption or slowdown, including
those caused by Multiversity’s failure to successfully upgrade its technologies and systems, could cause some
information, including prospective student applications or student work product, to be lost or delayed when
processed. Furthermore, e-learning institutions are vulnerable to data breaches by students themselves or by third
parties, particularly with the aim of retrieving official examination papers ahead of the examinations themselves
in order to leak them to all or part of the student body.

Such loss, delay or theft could result in loss of reputation and student dissatisfaction, which could in turn
adversely affect Multiversity’s reputation and business. Moreover, as a result of such a loss or delay, Multiversity
could be involved in remedial actions or legal proceedings which in turn might have a material adverse effect on
Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Multiversity’s institutions may not be able to respond to technological changes or satisfy future technology_**
**_demands of their students and could fall behind their competitors._**

Multiversity’s proprietary IT platform is a critical part of its strategy. Multiversity’s online and traditional
competitors that offer solutions that are similar to certain aspects of Multiversity’s IT platform might be able to
introduce more innovative and user friendly IT platforms. Multiversity’s competitiveness in the future will
depend on Multiversity’s ability to respond to technological changes and satisfy future technology demands by
developing technological solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner. There can be no assurance that
Multiversity will be able to achieve such technological advances.

**_If Multiversity fails to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information_**
**_security or if new laws in these areas are enacted, Multiversity could face claims or penalties, which could_**
**_adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations._**

In the conduct of its business, Multiversity collects, uses, transmits and stores data in its IT systems. This data
includes confidential information such as confidential exam content or information belonging to it, its students
and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of individuals, including employees.
Multiversity’s operations are based in Europe, and are therefore subject to the European General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR provides for stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection of
personal data, and any failure to comply with it could subject Multiversity to significant monetary forfeitures and
other penalties. In particular, Multiversity’s online universities routinely process and retain sensitive personal
data, including specific information regarding individuals’ ethnicity, gender and disability information or
information regarding student performance. The processing and storage of such information is highly regulated
under GDPR and other applicable privacy regimes, and any mishandling of this data could subject Multiversity to
significant regulatory penalties or civil liabilities. As such, any breach in data privacy protection regulations
could have a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business and could lead to a negative reputational impact.
In addition, if the security measures Multiversity uses to protect personal data are ineffective due to a systems
failure or other reasons (including ones not caused by Multiversity), Multiversity could be subject to liability,
including for breach of data protection legislation, claims of invasion of privacy, impersonation, unauthorized
purchases or other claims. It is also possible that Multiversity’s employees could, fraudulently or otherwise,
misuse personal data and Multiversity would be liable for such misuse.

If Multiversity does not maintain suitable controls and processes that comply with the GDPR, its ability to attract
and retain students may be adversely impacted, its reputation may deteriorate and its business, prospects, results
of operations, cash flow and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.

Multiversity could also incur significant expenses in connection with remedying any potential security breaches,
by either settling any resulting claims against Multiversity, defending itself in court or administrative
proceedings and putting in place additional measures in order to further protect itself from the threat of these
breaches. In addition, any failure to protect personal information may adversely impact Multiversity’s ability to
attract and retain students, cause its reputation to deteriorate and materially and adversely affect its business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

As further described in the section “Regulation”, Multiversity is subject to extensive regulation and supervision
in a variety of areas including those related to privacy, data protection and information security. However, new
regulations and guidelines are introduced relatively frequently. Any changes in the regulatory framework, in how
regulations are applied, or any further implementation of new requirements for private companies providing
online education services may have a detrimental effect on the business and operations of Multiversity.

**_If Multiversity is unable to protect its intellectual property, or if it infringes on the intellectual property of_**
**_third parties, its business could be affected._**

Multiversity’s trademarks, patents, copyright and other intellectual property rights distinguish its universities and
the services they provide from those of its competitors and are critical to Multiversity’s ability to continue to
develop and enhance its brand. In particular, Multiversity relies on trademark protection in Italy and worldwide
to protect its rights to the trademark ‘Pegaso’ and ‘EIPASS’, among others, and its distinctive logos and other
marks associated with its programs and services. It has registered 40 domain names and 12 trademarks, as well as
the algorithm underlying its IT platform’s flowchart, among other software registrations (see “Business—
_Intellectual Property” for further information). Moreover, in the ordinary course of its business, Multiversity_
develops intellectual property of many kinds, also in collaboration with its commercial partners, that is or will be
the subject of copyright or other protections. Such intellectual property includes but is not limited to didactic and
research materials and business know-how, as well as its e-learning platform which has been developed by it
entirely in-house.

There is no guarantee that third parties (including its commercial and academic business partners) will not in the
future infringe or misappropriate its trademarks, brand names or other intellectual property, and that any present
or future measures enacted by Multiversity to protect its intellectual property and enforce its rights are or will be
sufficient. Furthermore, Multiversity also may be involved in disputes from time to time over rights and
obligations concerning certain other intellectual property that it utilizes, and Multiversity may not prevail in these
disputes which may also incur significant costs for the company. Third parties may bring claims against
Multiversity alleging infringement or violation of their intellectual property. Some third party intellectual
property rights may be extremely broad and it may not be possible for Multiversity to conduct its operations in
such a way as to avoid infringement of those intellectual property rights. Any claims of infringement or alleged

46


-----

infringement of intellectual property rights could negatively impact Multiversity’s reputation and branding,
which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

Policing the unauthorized use or theft of Multiversity’s trademarks, brand name know-how and technology is
complex and costly, and a litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect such intellectual property rights or to
determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The outcome of such potential litigation may
not always be in favor of Multiversity and, even in the event of a successful outcome, the remedies may not be
sufficient able to adequately protect its rights.

**_Multiversity may also be subject to claims by third parties in connection with infringement of the intellectual_**
**_property rights of third parties. Multiversity might face penalties and charges if found liable for any_**
**_infringements or might be required to comply with injunctions against it to prevent further infringement. This_**
**_could affect Multiversity’s reputation and its prospects, results of operations and financial condition._**
**_Multiversity’s financial performance depends in part on its ability to maintain or increase its tuition fees._**

The principal factors that could have an adverse impact on Multiversity’s ability to maintain current levels of
tuition fees or to potentially increase tuition fees in the future include:

- negative perceptions of the quality of its services or a decline in the reputation or official rankings of
Multiversity’s academic institutions;

- resistance to tuition fee increases by tuition payers due to difficult economic conditions;

- lower fees or reductions or discounts of tuition fees by competitors in the markets in which Multiversity
operates; and

- future government regulation that may impact the tuition fee structure.

As of December 31, 2020, approximately 77%[36] of Multiversity’s revenues were generated from tuition fees paid
by students offered at its two core institutions, Pegaso and Mercatorum. The inability to maintain or increase
tuition fees as a result of these or other factors could have a material and adverse effect on Multiversity’s
business, prospects, financial conditions and results of operations.

In addition, to stimulate demand, online and traditional competitors might offer discounted tuition fees, which
might lead to increased price pressures and sharpened competition within the Italian higher education market. As
a result, Multiversity’s profitability might be affected by the risk of rising price pressure. Multiversity’s ability to
respond to such pressure would depend on how quickly its institutions could adapt and adjust their tuition fees.
Any failure to adequately respond to competitors’ tuition reductions or if potential students do not perceive the
quality and value of the services offered by Multiversity’s institutions, and those institutions are unable to
compensate for the tuition decreases by attracting more students, Multiversity’s business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

**_If Multiversity is unable to attract and retain its faculty, administrators and skilled personnel, it may not be_**
**_able to support its growth strategy and deliver updated programs._**

Multiversity must attract and retain highly qualified (and, in some cases, high profile) faculty, administrators, IT
specialists and other skilled personnel to implement its growth strategy and deliver up-to-date programs, along
with maintaining quality of instruction.

If Multiversity fails to attract new skilled personnel or faculty or fails to retain and motivate its existing faculty,
administrators, and skilled personnel, it may have to withdraw certain programs and may experience a reduction
in student enrollment which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations.
Additionally, a possible increase in the turnover rate could adversely affect its ability to attract and recruit
sufficient staff in key areas which could affect the quality and consistency of the curricula, in turn affecting
students’ academic performance as well as the brand and reputation of its educational institutions.

In addition, as Multiversity continues to expand and add personnel, it may face additional difficulty in
maintaining consistency in the quality of the teaching staff that it recruits. A shortage of quality teaching
personnel and a high turnover rate of staff could lead to ineffective delivery of the curricula offered to students,
impacting their academic performance and Multiversity’s reputation. If Multiversity is unable to, or is perceived

each case described under “Business—Offering—Ancillary Fees and Services” below.

-----

to be unable to, attract and retain qualified and effective teachers, principals, school administrators and support
staff, its business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition may be materially and
adversely affected.

**_Demand for Multiversity’s services is affected by employment demand, including by the Italian public_**
**_administration._**

Demand for Multiversity’s services is affected by the Italian employment market as students of Multiversity’s
institutions tend to enroll in a particular course in periods when there are or are expected to be significant
employment opportunities in the relevant sector that they are looking to achieve a qualification in. Similarly,
scarce employment opportunities in particular industry sectors might adversely affect the number of students
pursuing relevant qualifications. For example, total enrollments across all of Multiversity’s institutions declined
by approximately 4% in the 2020/2021 academic year, specifically due to a decrease in enrollments in certain
postgraduate and individual courses which are usually undertaken in order to participate in public tenders
(concorsi pubblici) for the assignment of public employment posts, such as teaching positions. See “Business—
_Enrollment, Student Demographics and Performance by Entity” for further information on enrollment figures for_
the 2020/2021 academic year.

Accordingly, should employment opportunities decrease in the Italian job market or, more specifically, should
the Italian public administration fail to launch tender procedures periodically or with the expected frequency
(usually every two years), or should such tenders require the recruitment of less personnel than expected, demand
for Multiversity’s programs and services could decline, thereby materially and adversely affecting Multiversity’s
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_If Multiversity fails to enroll new students and re-enroll existing students, its financial performance may_**
**_suffer._**

Increasing enrollments in the courses offered by Multiversity’s educational institutions is critical to
Multiversity’s financial performance. The online education market has shown constant growth in Italy since the
2015/2016 academic year—see “Industry—The student base is overall resilient over time, with the traditional
_segment enrolling the majority of students and the online segment growing taking share from traditional and_
_unlocking additional unmet demand”. In line with this trend, the number of students enrolled in Pegaso and_
Mercatorum’s undergraduate degree courses for the academic year 2020/2021 increased by 49% with respect to
the previous academic year. However, the overall number of students enrolled in all courses offered overall by
Multiversity slightly decreased (by approximately -4%) compared to the previous academic year, due principally
to the seasonality effect linked to public tenders (concorsi pubblici) for specific professions such as teachers—
such public tenders are usually carried out every two years by the public administration. Multiversity’s revenues
and Adjusted EBITDA were not impacted by the decrease in the total number of enrolled student base due to the
increase in undergraduate programmes that have longer duration and higher tuition fee, and in fact grew by 36%
and 37%, respectively, in 2020 as compared to 2019. For further information as to the causes underlying the
decrease, see “—Demand for Multiversity’s services is affected by employment demand, including by the Italian
_public administration” above. In addition, see “Business—Offering” and “Business— Enrollment, Student_
_Demographics and Performance by Entity” for further details on the number of students enrolled in Pegaso and_
Mercatorum.

If Multiversity is unable to secure new students through its marketing and recruitment efforts, or fails to expand
its educational offering, it may be unable to maintain and/or increase enrollment rates at its universities. A high
volume of Pegaso and Mercatorum’s students benefit from preferential rates which are lower than the full-priced
tuition fees. Such students, are entitled to preferential rates pursuant to certain agreements that such institutions
have entered into with private companies as well as public bodies, in order to provide their employees (and in
some cases their related parties) with more favourable rates and thereby incentivizing such employees to, for
example, attend courses in order to accelerate their career paths or to comply with the ongoing professional
development requirements set up by regulators or employers. Pegaso and Mercatorum together have in place
over 1,500 agreements securing captive customers which provide for the application of preferential rates for
undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses (see “Business—Tuition Fees—Preferential and corporate
_rates”). Should a proportion of such agreements be terminated or not be renewed, Multiversity would be unable_
to offer the same competitive rates to certain categories of students who may choose to enroll at a competitor as a
result, thereby impacting Multiversity’s ability to maintain the current enrollment rates at its universities.

In addition, if Multiversity’s institutions fail to maintain or enhance the quality of education they offer or change
their current offering, students may choose not to re-enroll or may decide to drop out of university. If
Multiversity is unable to recruit or retain students in its universities, its business, prospects, results of operations,
cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

**_As Multiversity is an online provider of education, it is substantially dependent on continued growth and_**
**_acceptance of online education and, if recognition by students and employers of the value of online education_**
**_does not continue to grow, its ability to grow its business could be adversely impacted._**

Continued growth in online education is expected to be largely dependent on new students and employers
recognizing the value of degrees and courses obtained from online institutions. If students and employers are not
convinced that an online education provides necessary value, or if growth in the market penetration of online
education slows, growth in the industry and, consequently, Multiversity’s business, could be adversely affected.
Because Multiversity’s business model is based solely on online education and distance learning, if acceptance of
online education does not continue to grow, its ability to expand its business and increases its revenues year-onyear, its results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

**_If Multiversity loses key management personnel, its business could be adversely affected._**

Multiversity’s success depends, in part, on its ability to attract and retain key management personnel. If its
officers, managers and department heads are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions for any
reason, Multiversity may not be able to replace them easily or at all. Loss of the services of experienced
management personnel may be disruptive and cause uncertainty. The process to replace these individuals would
involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of Multiversity’s
business objectives. An inability to attract and retain qualified key management personnel in a timely manner
could have a material and adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, prospects, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Any negative impact on the reputation of Multiversity’s institutions and sector could adversely affect its_**
**_business._**

Multiversity is susceptible to reputational risks and may be negatively impacted by negative publicity. In
particular, Multiversity’s ability to attract and retain students depends largely on the academic reputation and
popularity of its universities. Factors which may negatively impact reputation and result in negative publicity
include:

- perceptions of students and regulators about the quality of curricula, teaching staff or program facilities;

- accidents, criminal incidents or other events that adversely affect Multiversity’s employees or its students,
including in the locations in which Multiversity operates; and/or

- legal, fiscal, regulatory or compliance action which highlights concerns about Multiversity’s operations.

If any of these or similar events occur, Multiversity could face regulatory or even criminal sanctions, loss of
authorizations, fines or other financial or reputational harm (including negative press). The occurrence of such
events may lead to a decline in new student enrollments and cancelation of enrollments and therefore could have
a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, the occurrence of an event affecting the reputation of one or more of Multiversity’s universities could
be associated with the brand of a specific university or, more broadly, with Multiversity as a whole and could
influence the way its programs are viewed, not only by potential students, but also by its partners, regulators and
other parties in the education sector and the general public. A reduction in the number of students enrolled in
Multiversity’s institutions or the inability to maintain or increase tuition fees and the variety of its offering as a
result of damage to the reputation of any one of Multiversity’s institutions or in the institutions of Multiversity as
a whole, could have an adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Multiversity’s ability to retain existing contracts with key personnel and to attract potential students is also
dependent on the maintenance of its reputation. Multiversity is vulnerable to adverse market perception as it
operates in an industry where a high level of integrity and trust is paramount. Inappropriate or illegal behaviour
of the members of the staff or students could occur and this might have bearing on the public perception of
Multiversity’s educational institutions. Any perceived, actual or alleged mismanagement, fraud or failure to
satisfy Multiversity’s responsibilities or negative publicity resulting from such activities or allegations of such
activities (whether founded or not) could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_Multiversity’s future growth and profitability is dependent upon the effectiveness of its marketing and_**
**_advertising efforts and brand reputation._**

Multiversity’s future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness of its marketing
and advertising strategy and brand reputation. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, Multiversity

49


-----

advertises its programs and services through social media and various online channels, as well as through
traditional marketing methods. See “Business—Student Orientation and Marketing and Sales” for further details.

If Multiversity’s media performance is not effective in promoting program awareness or brand reputation, or if it
is not able to reach its target demographic, its future results of operations and financial condition may be
adversely affected.

**_Changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

Multiversity and its subsidiaries are subject to income and other taxes mainly in Italy in particular, changes in
Italian tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application could materially affect our tax expenses
and profitability.

Italian tax law and administration is complex and often requires us to make subjective determinations about
whether, and calculations about to what extent, we owe amounts to the relevant tax authorities. We often rely on
generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the
relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. We are from time to time subject
to tax audits and investigations by the tax authorities, which include investigations with respect to the direct tax
and indirect tax regime applicable to our transactions.

Future changes in tax laws, treaties, or regulations, and their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable,
particularly as the taxing jurisdiction face an increasing number of political, budgetary and other fiscal
challenges. Tax rates in Italy may change as a result of macroeconomic and other factors outside of our control,
making it increasingly difficult for corporations like ourselves to operate with certainty about taxation. As a
result, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation
or enforcement), which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, and
financial condition, as well as our effective income tax rate.

**_Multiversity and its subsidiaries may be subject to legal and tax proceedings in the ordinary course of its_**
**_business._**

From time to time, Multiversity and its subsidiaries may also be party to legal or tax proceedings or
investigations by public authorities, arising in the ordinary course of its business. Litigation can be costly and
time-consuming and divert management resources from business operations. In the event of an adverse outcome,
Multiversity and its subsidiaries could incur significant defense costs, be required to pay damages and interest to
the prevailing party and, depending on the jurisdiction of the litigation, be held responsible for paying the costs
of the prevailing party. In addition, tax, judicial or other governmental authorities may impose significant fines
or other measures (including, inter alia, operational bans) if they conclude that Multiversity and its subsidiaries’
operations have not been conducted in accordance with applicable legislation, regulations, rules or best practice
guidelines or certain specific corporate compliance requirements, such as the obligation to have in place
organizational and internal monitoring systems (including an internal control model pursuant to Legislative
Decree no. 231 of 8 June 2001, which certain entities of the Multiversity Group adopted starting from 2019 and
which is currently being updated). For details of the legal or tax proceedings to which Multiversity and the
members of its group are subject, see ‘‘Business—Litigation and legal, tax and administrative proceedings.’’

**_Multiversity relies on third parties to provide certain services, mainly related to providing information and_**
**_orientation or certifications to new students. If Multiversity is not able to manage this third parties’ network it_**
**_could face a decrease of the new enrollments._**

Multiversity relies on its network of approximately 3,000[37] ELCPs located all over Italy to provide certain
services, primarily, in the case of Pegaso and Mercatorum’s ELCPs, the orientation of new potential students.
Approximately 60% of new students at Pegaso and Mercatorum are oriented by the ELCPs. In the case of
Certipass, its ELCPs are authorised to provide EIPASS Certifications and related services. See “Business—
_Presence and Property” for further details. Although Multiversity has entered into specific accreditation_
agreements with all of the ELCPs managing these orientation activities, they remain independent third-party
providers and there is no guarantee that they will at all times operate in line with Multiversity’s expectations or
requirements or that they will not breach the terms of the relevant accreditation agreement, resulting in
Multiversity terminating the contractual relationship. Furthermore, ELCPs’ actions are outside of Multiversity’s
control and could be at times contrary to Multiversity’s policies, potentially resulting in reputational damages for
Multiversity which might impact Multiversity’s perception among prospective students and the number of
students seeking enrollment.

37 Certain ELCPs are accredited by more than one Multiversity institution

50


-----

In addition, should Multiversity be unable to continue to secure the services of these or other third parties
(through increased competition or for other reasons) its ability to provide orientation or certification services to
students across the territory could be significantly impacted which might lead to a decrease in new enrollments.

**Any change in the timing of tuition fee payments could create cash flow issues for Multiversity.**

Payment of tuition fees for undergraduate courses and academic master’s degrees are generally due in four equal
instalments in September-November, May, June and July of each academic year, whereas tuition fees for
postgraduate master’s courses are generally payable in a single lump-sum payment.

The timing of the incurrence of expenses by Multiversity may, however, not necessarily correspond to this
pattern. If Multiversity were to be required by regulation or as a result of market conditions to collect its fees
after courses have been completed by the student, this could have an adverse effect on its cash flows.

**Risks Related to Multiversity’s Capital Structure**

**_The substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect the Multiversity_**
**_business, financial position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under_**
**_the Notes._**

Upon consummation of the Acquisition, Multiversity will be highly leveraged and will have significant debt
service obligations. As of June 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the principal amount
of our financial indebtedness would have been €806.7 million, consisting of indebtedness under the Notes and
€38.7 million drawn under our Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization,” “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” We anticipate that our high leverage will continue for_
the foreseeable future and could have material consequences.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes the Revolving Credit
Facility and other debt and liabilities we may be permitted to incur;

- increasing the vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic and industry conditions;

- increasing the exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating rate of
interest;

- limiting Multiversity and its subsidiaries’ ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working
capital requirements, capital expenditures, business opportunities and other corporate requirements and
increasing the costs of such additional financings;

- placing Multiversity at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt in
relation to cash flow;

- requiring Multiversity to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund our operations
and for other corporate purposes;

- limiting the flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, competitive environment and
industry;

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on the ability to satisfy its debt
obligations, including under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt and liabilities we may be
permitted to incur.

**_Multiversity may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult to service the debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair the ability to operate the businesses._**

Despite its substantial leverage, Multiversity may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Multiversity has
the ability to borrow up to €100.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture also permits the
incurrence of additional debt thereunder. The Indenture also permits to incur a substantial amount of
indebtedness at subsidiaries and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from security
interests over assets that do not secure the Notes. Any debt that Multiversity subsidiaries incur could be
structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes or
such debt is secured by liens that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets
securing such debt, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture

51


-----

will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of
significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could
be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our existing debt
levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Indenture will not prevent us from
incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness thereunder. Our inability to service our debt could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfil our
obligations under the Notes.

**_Following the consummation of the Transactions, we will be subject to restrictive covenants that will limit our_**
**_operating and financial flexibility._**

Restrictive covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture may restrict our ability to
operate our business. Our failure to comply with these covenants, including as a result of events beyond our
control, could result in an event of default that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains and the Indenture will contain negative
covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to:

- make certain loans or investments;

- incur indebtedness or issue guarantees;

- sell, lease, transfer or dispose of assets and subsidiary stock;

- merge or consolidate with other companies;

- pay dividends and make other restricted payments;

- create or incur liens;

- agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions;

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

The restrictions that are included under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture could affect
Multiversity ability to operate its business and may limit its ability to react to market conditions or take
advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could materially
adversely affect the ability to finance its operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances,
restructure our organization or finance capital needs, if any. Additionally, the ability to comply with these
covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond Multiversity control. These include prevailing
economic, financial and industry conditions. If Multiversity breaches any of these covenants or restrictions, it
could be in default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the Indenture.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants_
to which we will be subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our
ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

**_If the Multiversity Investment does not occur on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will be_**
**_required to redeem its Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes and the_**
**_escrowed funds may not be sufficient to cover the special mandatory redemption price._**

The gross proceeds from the Offering will be held in the Escrow Account pending the satisfaction of certain
conditions, some of which are outside of our control. If the Multiversity Investment does not occur on or prior to
the Escrow Longstop Date or if certain other events that trigger escrow termination occur, the Notes will be
subject to a special mandatory redemption as described in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption” and you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on the Notes. Upon_
such redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields
comparable returns. In addition, if you purchase the Notes at a price greater than the issue price of the Notes, you
may suffer a loss on your investment. The escrow funds will be initially limited to the gross proceeds from the
Offering and will not be sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price, which is equal to 100% of the

52


-----

aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue
Date to, but excluding, the date of special mandatory redemption and there is no assurance that the Issuer will
have access to the funds necessary to allow it to pay the full amount of the required redemption price in the event
of a special mandatory redemption. In addition, the Issuer will have three business days following release of the
escrowed funds from the Escrow Account to complete the Multiversity Investment, which means that during
such period such funds will not be subject to the Escrow Charge.

**_Italian tax legislation may restrict the deductibility of all or a portion of the interest expense on our_**
**_indebtedness, including interest expense in respect of the Notes._**

Current tax legislation in Italy (Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986 (“Decree
**No. 917”), as amended by Legislative Decree No. 142 of November 29, 2018) allows for the full tax deductibility**
of interest expense incurred by a company in each fiscal year up to the amount of the interest income of the same
fiscal year or carried forward from previous fiscal years. A further deduction of interest expense in excess of this
amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of the EBITDA of the company (i.e., risultato operativo lordo della
_gestione caratteristica or “ROL”) to be quantified on the basis of the relevant tax values assumed from the_
perspective of the Italian corporate income tax (i.e. considering the tax adjustments applied for corporate income
tax purposes to items included in the ROL computed from an accounting perspective). The amount of ROL not
used for the deduction of the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income can be carried forward,
increasing the amount of ROL for the following five fiscal years. Interest expense not deducted in a relevant
fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years, provided that, in such fiscal years, the amount of
interest expense that exceeds interest income is lower than 30% of ROL. In the case of a tax group, interest
expense not deducted by an entity in the tax group due to lack of ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level,
within the limit of the excess of ROL of the other companies within the tax group.

Based on the above rules, the Issuer (or the Group) may not be able to deduct for Italian tax purposes all interest
expenses borne in each relevant fiscal year.

In the past, the Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leveraged buyout transactions
with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. However,
on March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter No. 6/E clarifying, as a common principle,
that interest on an acquisition bank loan in leveraged buyout (“LBO”) transactions are generally deductible for
the Italian corporate income tax (“IRES”) purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in Article 96 of
Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986. In particular, the Italian Revenue Agency confirmed as a
general principle that LBO transactions are generally based on sound economic reasons considering that the
financing from third party lenders is usually conditional on acquisition of control over the target company by a
special purpose vehicle and the following merger with debt push down. As a result of such guidance, LBO
transactions are generally not considered irregular for tax purposes absent specific circumstances in which the tax
authorities contend that the structuring of any such transaction was designed to obtain unlawful tax advantages in
violation of the law or established legal principles (e.g., re-leveraged transactions without a change of control).

Any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation, including any future limitation on the use of the
ROL of the Issuer and/or the subsidiaries of the Issuer included in the tax group, if any, or the tax treatment of
interest expense arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, the failure to satisfy the applicable legal
requirements relating to the deductibility of interest expense or the application by Italian tax authorities of certain
existing interpretations of Italian tax law may result in our inability to fully deduct our interest expenses, and the
application of withholding taxes, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of
any of the Transactions, including the issue of the Notes or the use of proceeds from the Offering, including on
the basis of anti-avoidance or anti-abusive criteria, we may be unable to fully deduct our interest expenses or
may be subject to (i) significant penalties and accrued interest; (ii) the imposition of withholding taxes or
(iii) other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

In the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, refinancing needs,
regulatory requirements, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may decide to engage in equity or debt
financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons, and we may not be able to secure any such debt or
equity financing or refinancing on favorable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Any debt financing obtained by
us in the future could also involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other
financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to
pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.

53


-----

If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities
convertible into equity, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership
of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to
those of holders. If we unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we
require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be
significantly limited which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_The interests of the principal shareholder may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The Issuer is beneficially owned by funds advised by CVC. Since the consummation of the Acquisition, the
Target Group has been directly wholly owned by the Issuer. As a result, the CVC has, directly or indirectly, the
power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to
approve other changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our
shareholders. CVC’s interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as noteholders,
particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example, CVC
could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Moreover, CVC is in the business of making investments
in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us and/or
that operate in our markets or adjacent ones. CVC may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are
complementary to or in competition with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be
available to us. In addition, CVC may hold interests in suppliers or customers of the target companies. CVC and
its respective affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures (including one or more
divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in changes to our shareholding
structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their
equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees**

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of the Issuer’s existing and future subsidiaries_**
**_that do not guarantee the Notes, including contractually subordinated to any indebtedness under the_**
**_Revolving Credit Facility. None of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date and upon the completion of the Multiversity Investment, the Notes will not be guaranteed. The
Issuer’s subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or to
make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or otherwise. As such,
the claims of creditors of our subsidiaries, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if
any), will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of the creditors of
the Issuer, including claims by the holders of the Notes.

Subject to restrictions in the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility, we may incur additional indebtedness,
including at the level of our subsidiaries. See “—We may incur additional indebtedness, including at the level of
_our subsidiaries, which could increase our risk exposure from debt and could decrease your share in any_
_proceeds.”_

**_The Issuer is incorporated in Italy, and Italian insolvency laws may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes_**
**_as insolvency laws in other jurisdictions with which they may be familiar._**

The Issuer is organized and is likely to have its center of main interests under the laws of Italy. The insolvency
laws of Italy may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with
which you may be familiar, including in respect of creditors’ reorganization, priority of creditors, the ability to
obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to
recover payments due on the Notes to the extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. In
the event that the Issuer or any future subsidiary of the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the insolvency and other laws of Italy may
be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other
creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to
obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws could call into
question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your
rights against the Collateral in Italy and limit any amounts that you may receive. For an overview of certain
insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Issuer, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

54


-----

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging liabilities and certain debt that we may incur in_**
**_the future will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in_**
**_priority to the Notes._**

In addition to securing the Notes, the assets that comprise the Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis
our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. The Indenture and the
Revolving Credit Facility will also permit the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness in
accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the
liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations will have priority over any
amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to such
Collateral. In the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not be able to recover on such Collateral if the
then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility and such amount in respect of such hedging
obligations are greater than or equal to the proceeds realized. In addition, any proceeds from an enforcement sale
of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and such amount in
respect of such hedging obligations have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment
of the Notes and any other obligations secured by such Collateral on a pari passu basis, which obligations may
be significant. As a result, holders of Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of other secured indebtedness
of the Group.

**_The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the_**
**_Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral and other secured indebtedness may be
secured by assets that do not secure the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security”. Not all our assets will
secure the Notes and the Indenture allows the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain future
indebtedness permitted to be incurred with certain property and assets that do not secure the Notes. If an event of
default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Notes Guarantee thereof
will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other
unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded
from the Collateral securing the Notes. The claims of secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also
secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such,
the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

On or following the Issue Date, within the time periods specified herein, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis by the Collateral. The Collateral comprises,
(i) limited recourse pledge over Paganini’s shares in the Issuer, (ii) limited recourse security interest agreement
over Paganini’s structural intercompany receivables owing to it by the Issuer (if any) and (iii) within 20 business
days following the Post-Closing Reorganisation, limited recourse pledge over Paganini’s shares in Multiversity.
The Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain hedging agreements. The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms
of the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the
Notes to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the first- priority debt secured by the Collateral. The
Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral. The value of the Collateral and the amount
to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others,
the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the
condition of the Italian economy and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be
relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and
may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for
the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In
addition, (i) the pledges, shares and ownership interests of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to
an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding because all of the obligations of the entity must first be satisfied, leaving
little or no remaining assets in the entity and (ii) the total amount secured under the Collateral is not linked to the
market value of the underlying assets.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral, and an enforcement action may result in the_**
**_termination of licenses._**

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted
under the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or
after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security

-----

Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can
be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or
re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions (including the laws of Italy).

If the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, investors in
the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured
claim against the Issuer’s remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral
or any intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon
enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be
less than its value to Multiversity.

The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests
in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security
interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. In addition, the consents of any third
parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent
may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease.

Furthermore, due consideration should be given by investors to the circumstance that enforcement procedures
and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Italy may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in
equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.

In addition, our business requires a variety of licenses. The continued operation of Multiversity depends on the
maintenance of such licenses. Under some of Multiversity’s institutions’ licenses, public authorities impose
restrictions on the transfers of the ownership of the license holder, including a change of control clause, which
prohibits the transfer of the ownership of the license holder without the prior approval of the authority. In the
event of an enforcement action under the terms of the Notes which resulted in the transfer of ownership of the
Issuer or its subsidiaries, or a change in the shareholding of the Multiversity for other reasons, the authorities
may attempt to cancel our licenses. In addition, the uncertainty concerning the transferability of such licenses
themselves could significantly reduce the value placed on the licenses by third parties and ultimately reduce the
amount recovered in the event of an enforcement action. The applicable governmental authorities may not
consent to the transfer of any of such licenses. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not
obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting
shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

**_The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the Collateral may be complicated,_**
**_involve long recovery times and a low recovery rate._**

In connection with the enforcement of pledge over shares of entities with outstanding debt obligations, any sale
of such entities is likely to involve a release of some or all of the debt of such entity, which could result in a
taxable capital gain to such entities. As the Notes will be issued by the Issuer, an enforcement over the shares of
the Issuer would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In
addition, the Indenture will not prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future.
Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the
Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce
the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value of the pledge over
the shares of the Issuer may be limited. In addition, the Collateral includes, inter alia, a security interest over the
shares of each of the Issuer and, after the Post-Closing Reorganisation, Multiversity.

**_The Collateral and any future guarantees or security of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on_**
**_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity_**
**_and enforceability._**

The Italian corporate benefit and financial assistance regulatory regime makes it unlikely that the subsidiaries of
the Issuer will guarantee and/or secure the Notes. However, if such guarantees and/or security were to be granted,
the obligations of any future guarantor and/or security provider of the Notes (a “Guarantor”), the enforcement
of each of their Notes Guarantees and/or Collateral, the obligations of the grantors of guarantee and/or security
and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Notes Guarantee and/or Collateral will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed and/or secured, as applicable, by such Guarantor under the applicable
laws of Italy, including a limitation to the extent that the granting of such guarantee and/or security is not in the
relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or otherwise would result in violations of laws related to corporate
benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under value. See “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_

_Considerations.” Accordingly, enforcement of any such Notes Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant_
Guarantor would be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations
contained in the terms of the Notes Guarantees or Collateral designed to ensure compliance with statutory
requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses include those that relate to
fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulation or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the liability of a Guarantor under its Notes
Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the amounts of its other
obligations and the law applicable to it.

As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, financial assistance and
corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, as regards any guarantor or security provider incorporated
in Italy (an “Italian Guarantor”):

(i) in order to comply with the provisions of the Italian law in relation to financial assistance (including article
2358 and/or article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code), the Notes Guarantee and security
interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not include and/or extend to any amounts of the
Notes the purpose or the actual use of which is to finance, directly or indirectly, the acquisition of the
relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) and/or the subscription of any
shares or quota in the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) (or to
refinance, directly or indirectly, any existing indebtedness incurred for such purposes) and/or the payment
of any fees, costs and expenses, stamp, registration or other taxes in connection therewith;

(ii) the Notes Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed at any
time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or other financial
support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions) advanced or
made available from time to time to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries
pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1 and 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or
indirectly) on or following the Acquisition Closing Date, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of
the relevant Notes Guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of
its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or received upon the enforcement of any security
interests granted by such Italian Guarantor; provided further that no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a
Guarantor and/or security provider in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that it is entitled to
set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any
payment made by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or as a result of the
enforcement of any security interests granted by it;

(iii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by any Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal
amount of the Notes;

(iv) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor
will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal
to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the relevant Italian Guarantor at that
time;

(v) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of Civil
Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of such Guarantor under its Notes
Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the
Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set
forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Banking Act, respectively.

In the event that the Post-Closing Reorganisation does not occur by December 15, 2022, as regards to Target and
any of its subsidiaries, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial assistance law and corporate
benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, until such time as the Post-Closing Reorganisation is completed (if
ever):

(i) the Notes Guarantee and security interests to be granted by Target and any of its subsidiaries will only
guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes in a proportion equal to that which Tranche B
bears to the nominal principal amount of the Notes at issuance (the “Refinancing Proportion”) and shall

57


-----

not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or
other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity
contributions) advanced or made available from time to time to Target and any of its subsidiaries (or any of
its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1 and 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by
the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Acquisition Closing Date, and outstanding at
the time of the enforcement of the relevant Notes Guarantee or security, net of any proceeds already paid
pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or received upon the
enforcement of any security interests granted by Target and any of its subsidiaries; provided further that
Target and any of its subsidiaries shall not be liable as a Guarantor and/or security provider in respect of
any amounts in excess of the amount that it is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or
subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by Target and any of its
subsidiaries under the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or as a result of the enforcement of any security
interests granted by it;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Target and any of its subsidiaries, also in accordance with
article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the
Tranche B (as described under “Summary—The Offering”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an
amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by
the ratio of (I) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as described under
“Summary—The Offering”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes;

(iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by Target and any of its
subsidiaries will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the
Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by Target and any of its
subsidiaries at that time;

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the
Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of Target and any of its
subsidiaries under its Notes Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying
as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in
violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian
Banking Act, respectively; and

(v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee
and/or security interest by Target and any of its subsidiaries does not (and will not) include and does not
(and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations under Tranche A
(as described under “Summary—The Offering”) under the Notes or in any way exceeding the Refinancing
Proportion;

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the proceeds of the
Notes which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of Target and Multiversity and, therefore, does not
fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of
the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not
sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion
of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription directly or indirectly by the Issuer
of the share capital of Target and Multiversity. Should the Notes Guarantee and/or security interests granted by
Target and any of its subsidiaries be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions
regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such
Notes Guarantee and security interests could be declared null and void.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as
Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement
of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the
corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or
secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor
Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the
abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian
Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the
Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating

58


-----

future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating
to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and
shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of
the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant
Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit
support as described above.

In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by an
Italian Guarantor to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum
amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in
the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such
determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed
disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests shall be distributed among the
guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover
limited amounts under the relevant Notes Guarantees and security. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Issuer will be dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to make payments on the_**
**_Notes._**

Prior to the Post-Closing Reorganisation, the Issuer will operate as a holding company that conducts no business
operations of its own and has no significant assets. As a result, the Issuer will be dependent upon the cash flow
from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends, intercompany loans or otherwise to make payments on the Notes.
The Issuer’s operating subsidiaries may not generate cash flow sufficient to enable the Issuer to meet its payment
obligations under the Notes. In addition, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be restricted from providing funds to the
Issuer under some circumstances. These circumstances could include, among others, restrictions under Italian
corporate law which require a company to retain at least 5% of its annual unconsolidated net income until such
reserve reaches at least 20% of the value of the company’s share capital, and future contractual restrictions,
including restrictions in credit facilities and other indebtedness, that may affect the ability of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Issuer. In addition, applicable tax laws may also
subject such payments to taxation.

Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to
incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us, there are significant
qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. We cannot assure you that the arrangements with our
subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of our
subsidiaries and our results of operations and cash flow generally will provide us with sufficient dividends,
distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other
payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the
Notes, and we do not expect to have any other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders
of the Notes.

**_The interests of the Sponsor may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The Issuer is beneficially owned by funds advised by CVC. Since the consummation of the Acquisition, the
Target Group has been directly wholly owned by the Issuer. As a result, the Sponsor has, directly or indirectly,
the power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and
to approve other changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our
shareholders. The Sponsor’s interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as noteholders,
particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example, the
Sponsor could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Moreover, the Sponsor is in the business of
making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or
indirectly with us and/or that operate in our markets or adjacent ones. The Sponsor may also pursue acquisition
opportunities that are complementary to or in competition with our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, the Sponsor may hold interests in suppliers or customers of
the target companies. The Sponsor and its respective affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares
which would result in changes to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other
transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might
involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

59


-----

Further, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or
guarantees which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the application of
Italian financial assistance and corporate benefit rules. Accordingly, in such circumstances you would have no
direct claim for payment against any such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party with respect to any
such additional collateral. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor or the bankruptcy trustee in the
case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantee or
Collateral on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Notes
Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent such limitations apply, the Notes would be
effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor to
the extent of such limitations. Future security or guarantees may be subject to similar limitations.

Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency
trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be
unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed
to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery
than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within
a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is
voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest.

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory
priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even if such
claims are secured claims. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by Italian_**
**_law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will not be
granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not
have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the security documents or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a
result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of
a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions
of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including the Republic of
Italy. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets,
but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty
under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not
identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or
can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including the Republic of Italy).
In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the
creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations
of the Issuer owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal
**Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable as Italian**
law does not provide for such a construct. All or part of the pledges and other security interests in jurisdictions
utilizing the Parallel Debt construct will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel
Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel
Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In
respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct
security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except
through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of
the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities
and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law,
and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not
validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not

60


-----

receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

Moreover, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and
perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the
holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision
(introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond
issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then
be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any
court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or
available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interests and guarantees by a
_rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf_
of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified
therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security
interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes
could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under
the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect
**period”). A longer period may apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which is granted after the**
Offering, including the Collateral that is granted on or after the Issue Date.

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory
priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims of other creditors, even if such
claims are secured claims.

See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the security
agent for the lenders under Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the hedging obligations which are permitted by
the Indenture to be secured on the Collateral, and any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be
incurred by the Indenture, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor
Agreement will regulate the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to
take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so
by an Instructing Group (as defined below under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”) that comprises (i) creditors holding more than 66_ [2]⁄3% of the indebtedness and
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, any other Credit Facility and certain priority hedging
obligations (the “Super Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and (ii) creditors holding more than 50.0% of the
indebtedness under the Notes and indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes with respect to the proceeds of
enforcement of security (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their
respective creditor representative). If, however, before the discharge of all obligations to the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and any other Credit Facility and so long as no insolvency event has occurred, the
Security Agent has received conflicting enforcement instructions from the creditor representatives (and for these
purposes, the failure to give instructions is deemed to be a conflicting instruction) then, to the extent the
instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent given) comply with the initial consultation
requirements and the security enforcement principles (one of which states that the primary and overriding
objective of an enforcement of security over the Collateral is the maximization, so far as is consistent with
prompt and expeditious realization of value, of recoveries by the Super Senior Creditors (as defined below under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”), the holders of the Notes and
certain creditors ranking pari passu with the holders of the Notes with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of
security) each as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will comply with the instructions
from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if the super senior liabilities have not been fully
discharged within six months, or no enforcement action has been taken by the Security Agent within three
months, of the date on which the initial consultation period expires (or where no consultation is required, of the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors providing a specified notice), or at any time after the occurrence of an
insolvency event with respect to certain members of the Multiversity Group, then the instructions of the Super
Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. To the extent the Multiversity Group incurs additional indebtedness

61


-----

that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of security, your
voting interest in an instructing group will be diluted commensurately with the amount of indebtedness the
Multiversity Group incurs.

The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any Credit Facility and creditors in respect of certain
hedging obligations may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may,
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents
at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer or any of its holding
companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action or other distressed disposal in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes against, and the liens over any other assets of, such entities and
any subsidiaries of such entity securing the Notes may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_The Issuer and the other security providers will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the operation_**
**_of the business or the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The security documents relating to the Notes allow the Issuer and the other security providers to remain in
possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from,
certain of the Collateral. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the
Issuer and the other security providers may, among other things, subject to the terms of the security documents,
without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with
respect to the Collateral such as selling, modifying, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the
Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these
activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the
proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on the Collateral. To the extent
these activities are allowed with regard to certain security interests, under Italian law such security interests could
be considered to be not validly perfected. To the extent these activities are allowed with regard to certain security
interests, under Italian law such security interests could be considered to be not validly perfected.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be_**
**_released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral will be released automatically, including:

- subject to the immediately following sub-paragraph below, in connection with any sale or other disposition
of property or assets constituting Collateral, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant
described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” covenant or other applicable provisions under the Indenture and is to a person that is not a_
Parent (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Definitions”), the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (as
defined under “Description of the Notes—Definitions”);

- any release of a security Interest in respect of the capital stock of the Issuer pursuant to the preceding bullet
will only be permitted if such capital stock is subject to a Lien of at least equivalent ranking (in the good
faith judgment of the Issuer) in favor of the note holders as soon as reasonably practicable after such release;

- in the case of a future guarantor that is released from its notes guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and capital stock, of such future guarantor as described
under “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers”;

- if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary (as defined under
“Description of the Notes—Definitions”) in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, only
with respect to the property and assets, and capital stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- in respect of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary (as defined under “Description of
_the Notes—Definitions”), following the release of any liens granted in favor of the Revolving Credit_
Facility, so long as no Event of Default (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Definitions”) has
occurred and is continuing, only in respect of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary that would result in the requirement under the Indenture for the Notes to be secured on such
property, assets or capital stock pursuant to the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Liens” or the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees”;_

- only with respect to the security interest in respect of all of the shares of the Issuer, to facilitate an initial
public offering of the Issuer;

-----

- in connection with a Permitted Reorganization as defined under “Description of the Notes—Definitions”;

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations of the Notes or defeasance or discharge
of the Notes, as provided under “Description of the Notes—Defeasance” and “Description of the Notes—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”; and_

- in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

See “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” Unless consented to by the holders of the Notes (and
subject to certain exceptions), the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall not, in an
enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the security interests in the Collateral unless, among other
things, the relevant sale or disposal is made:

- for consideration of which all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash; and

- pursuant to a public auction, or if a fairness opinion has been obtained from an internationally recognized
investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable third party professional firm.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral may be released and retaken in connection with the
refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes. In Italy, such a release and retaking of collateral may
give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect of the Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other
creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of
the grant of the Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of
the Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the
_Notes.”_

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under Italian law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and
thus retain its priority if certain actions are undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security
interest. The security interests in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we
or the Security Agent fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect the security interest. Such failure
may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of
such security interest in favor of third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a
security interest in the same Collateral.

The Trustee and Security Agent will not monitor, and we may not comply with our obligations to inform the
Trustee or the Security Agent of, any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and the necessary action
may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired property or rights. Such failure
may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of
such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other
creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

**_The granting of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such security interests_**
**_in accordance with Italian law._**

The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods
for such security interests in Italy and the relevant regime for hardening periods may be less favorable if the
secured debt (or part thereof) is pre-existing to the granting of the security interest, which is the case for
Collateral granted on or after the Issue Date. In addition, the granting of shared security interests to secure future
permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening periods. The applicable hardening period for these new
security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. In
each instance, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
relevant hardening period applicable in Italy, such security interest may be declared void and/or it may not be
possible to enforce it. In addition, the granting of a shared security interest to secure future indebtedness or the
transfer or the assignment of the security interest may restart or reopen hardening periods. The applicable
hardening period for each new security may run from the moment such new security is amended, transferred,
assigned, granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted were to be enforced before the end of
the respective applicable hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to
enforce it. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The same rights also apply following the Issue Date in connection with the accession of any subsidiaries as
guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of
holders of the Notes.

**_You may face interest rate risks by investing in the Notes, as certain of our borrowings bear, and the Notes_**
**_will bear, interest at floating rates that could be impacted by applicable regulation and that could rise_**
**_significantly, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

A substantial part of our indebtedness, including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes,
bears or will bear interest at per annum rates equal to EURIBOR (subject to a 0.0% floor), in each case adjusted
periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our
interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and
hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Although we currently intend to hedge the interest rate with
respect to the Notes, we may not be able to obtain such hedges, or replace such hedges, on terms that are
acceptable to us, and any such hedge may not be fully effective, which would expose us to interest rate risk.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law
enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into
whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of
LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR,
EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are
the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO
Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as
benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds,
which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of
administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or
benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For
example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or
compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA
**Announcement”). The FCA Announcement and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and Wholesale**
Policy at the FCA on January 28, 2019 indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and
will not be guaranteed, and market participants should not rely on its publication, after 2021. The potential
elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any
benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which
EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in
other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any such change, as well as manipulative
practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR,
which could have an adverse impact on Multiversity Group’s ability to service debt that bears interest at floating
rates of interest. The Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if the Issuer determines that EURIBOR is no
longer being calculated or administered, among other circumstances, the Issuer could cause an independent
financial advisor to determine an appropriate successor rate (or, if not reasonably practicable to appoint such
independent financial advisor, the Issuer would determine such successor benchmark rate), and make certain
adjustments to such rate, including applying a spread thereon to make such successor rate to reduce or eliminate
any economic benefit or prejudice to holders of the Notes as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR, which
upon certification by the Issuer to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent will be used
to calculate the interest rate in relation to the Notes without any further action or consent by the noteholders or
the Trustee. This means that interest on the Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together
with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Notes issued on the Issue Date. See
“Description of the Notes—Interest.” In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an
appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent financial advisor, the Indenture’s successor
rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark,
or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and
conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of
and return on any such floating rate debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of
interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable
to such debt. The application of these fallback provisions could result in the Notes becoming fixed rate
instruments.

**_Future liquidity and cash flow difficulties could prevent us from repaying the Notes when due or repurchasing_**
**_the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or_**
**_otherwise, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you_**
**_protection in the event of certain important corporate events and we will not be required to purchase the Notes_**
**_upon a Specified Change of Control Event._**

At final maturity of the Notes, or in the event of acceleration of the Notes following an event of default, the
entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes will become due and payable. In addition, upon the occurrence
of certain events constituting a change of control, holders of the Notes may in certain circumstances require us to
make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes—Change of
_Control.” We may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay these_
amounts when they become due.

Our failure to repay holders tendering Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control event would result in an
event of default under the Notes. If a change of control event were to occur, we cannot assure you that the Issuer
would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the
restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing
contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an
event of default under, or acceleration of, our Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes and other indebtedness. The
repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under the Revolving Credit Facility and
other indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its
subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control
may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when our
subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer, our subsidiaries may seek the consent of the
lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that
contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain
prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to
obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under
the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other
indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event
of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or other similar
transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in
voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in
the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not
contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes, respectively, in the
event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction. Moreover, a change of control will
be deemed not to have occurred if it constitutes a “Specified Change of Control Event”. See “Description of
_Notes—Certain definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_

The definition of “change of control” contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all
the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has
occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_The Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all holders_**
**_of the Notes with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes._**

The Indenture will contain provisions for calling meetings of the holders of the Notes to consider matters
affecting their interests generally. As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of Noteholders,” the
majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of the Notes will be one or more
persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. These
provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders
of the Notes, including holders of the Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of
the Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an

65


-----

extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for
payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to
redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes, to change the
quorum requirements relating to meetings, to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and/or to change
the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and may
have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes. Under Italian law, the approval of an
extraordinary resolution typically requires the consent of more than one half of the aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes. Our decision to increase the majority requirement is untested under Italian law, may be
challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer and others, and if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian
court, with the consequence being that the majority voting threshold may be reduced from 75% to 50%.

**_Payments in respect of the Notes may in certain circumstances be made subject to withholding or deduction of_**
**_tax for which holders may not receive additional amounts._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Italy and is an Italian resident for tax purposes and therefore payments
of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to
Italian tax laws and regulations. All payments made by the Issuer or on its behalf in respect of the Notes will be
made free and clear of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless the withholding or deduction is
required by law. In that event, subject to a number of exceptions, the Issuer or the Guarantors will pay such
additional amounts that may result in the holders of the Notes receiving such amounts that they would have
received in regards to such Notes had no such withholding or deduction been required.

The Issuer and the Guarantors are not liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes in certain
circumstances, including if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree
No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as amended or supplemented) (“Decree No. 239”) (except where the procedures
required under Decree No. 239 or under Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption have not been
complied with due solely to the actions or omissions by the Issuer or its agents) and any related implementing
regulations, or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (as amended or
supplemented) (“Decree No. 461”). In those circumstances, investors will receive the proceeds of their
investment in the Notes, net of applicable withholding or deductions.

In particular, holders of Notes that are not residents in White List countries, holders who are residents in White
List countries that do not properly and promptly comply with certain certification and procedural requirements
set forth by Decree No. 239 and by the relevant application rules to benefit from exemption from Italian taxation,
and certain categories of holders of the Notes who are residents in Italy, will therefore only receive the net
proceeds of their investment in the Notes and will not be paid any additional amounts to compensate them for the
withholding or deduction.

Although we believe that, under current law, Italian substitute tax will not be imposed under Decree No. 239
where the Notes are listed on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility upon issuance and the holder of
Notes is a resident for tax purposes in a White List country and such holder promptly and properly complies with
certain certification and procedural requirements set forth by Decree No. 239 and by the relevant application
rules, there is no assurance that this will be the case should there be a change in applicable law or relevant
procedures. See “Certain Tax Considerations OECD Common Reporting Standards—Certain Italian Tax
_Considerations” and “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Moreover, holders of the Notes should note_
that they will bear the risk of any change in the White List.

**_No assurance can be given that the procedural requirements provided by Decree No. 239 will be met by the_**
**_relevant foreign intermediaries._**

The exemption from withholding tax in principle granted to holders of the Notes—who are the beneficial owners
of the Notes (or, if the holders are institutional investors not subject to tax, even if they are not the beneficial
owners of the Notes) and are resident in countries included in the White List—applies if certain procedural
requirements are met. No assurance can be given that all non-Italian resident investors will be eligible for the
withholding tax exemption where the relevant foreign intermediary fails to provide sufficient information to the
relevant Italian tax authorities under the procedures for applying the exemption regime. Should the procedural
requirements not be met, Italian income substitute tax may apply on the payments made on the Notes to foreign
investors resident in countries included on the White List. In such event, the Issuer will not be required to pay
any additional amounts with respect to such withholding tax, unless such procedural requirements have not been
complied with due solely to the actions or omissions of the Issuer or its agents.

**_An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the Notes._**

The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no existing market. Application has been made to
list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit to trading on the Euro MTF
Market in accordance with the rules and regulations of that exchange. We cannot assure you that the Notes will
become or will remain listed. In addition, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may
develop for the Notes, the ability of holders of the Notes to sell them or the price at which the holders of the
Notes may be able to sell them. The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders
of the Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general
economic conditions and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as recommendations
by securities analysts. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt securities, such as the Notes, has
been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial price volatility. If a market for the Notes were to develop,
such a market may be subject to similar disruptions. We have been informed by the Initial Purchasers that they
intend to make a market for the Notes after this Offering is completed. Nevertheless, the Initial Purchasers are
not obligated to do so and may cease their market-making activity at any time without notice. In addition, such
market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable
laws and regulations. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop
or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to
a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among
other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which
investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we
have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return
on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and
could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to
which the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. Holders (as
defined in “Certain Tax Considerations OECD Common Reporting Standards—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”) may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if_
any. See “Certain Tax Considerations OECD Common Reporting Standards—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations.”_

Despite the measures taken by countries in the Eurozone to alleviate credit risk, concerns persist regarding the
debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall
stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political
circumstances in individual Eurozone member states. These and other concerns could lead to the reintroduction
of individual currencies in one or more member states, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible
dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for
holders of euro denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. We cannot assure
you that the official exchange rate at which the Notes may be redenominated would accurately reflect their value
in euro. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these developments and related issues,
could materially adversely affect the value of the Notes.

**_Fraudulent conveyance and similar laws may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes and_**
**_the Collateral._**

Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests granted to
secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors
under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect period. The avoidance may relate to
(i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency
at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the
value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in
kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of
knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action, (ii) security
granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the
state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action during the suspect period of six
months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions
at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect
period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the bankruptcy receiver must prove that

67


-----

the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any clawback action.
See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations” for further information._

Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In addition,
under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency
declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period
prior to insolvency. In addition, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the
various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European
Union.

If challenged successfully, the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be
refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, the holders of the
Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related
security documents.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer and its subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and our business is conducted entirely
outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer are nonresidents of the United States.
Although the Issuer will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action
under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these
directors and executive officers. In addition, as all the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of its
directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments
obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court,
actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United
States.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Italy. There is, therefore,
doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S. federal securities laws in an action to enforce a
U.S. judgment in Italy. In addition, the enforcement in Italy of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on
civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain
conditions. There is also doubt that a court in Italy would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies
sought in an original action brought in Italy on the basis of U.S. federal securities laws violations. See “Service of
_Process and Enforcement of Judgments.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies are expected to assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit
ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining
the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that
may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may
be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that
a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
materially adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they_**
**_may be sold._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws of the United States. The Notes have not been and will not be registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, you may not transfer or sell the Notes in the
United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement,
and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time. The
Notes and the Indenture contain provisions that restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise

68


-----

transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the
Securities Act, or other exemptions under the Securities Act. In addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes,
the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the
Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of less than €100,000. Furthermore, we
have not registered the Notes under any other country’s securities laws and do not have any intention to do so. It
is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries
comply with applicable securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until definitive Notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the Notes (which will only
occur in very limited circumstances), owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders
of Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be the
registered holder of the Notes. After payment to the common depositary, we and the Trustee will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry
interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the
participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under the
Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon
our solicitations for consents or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented
for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions on a timely
basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to
acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through
Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange._**

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit
to trading on the Euro MTF Market in accordance with the rules and regulations of that exchange. The Issuer
cannot assure you that the Notes will become, or remain listed. If the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, and the Issuer can no longer maintain such listing or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or
maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange; provided, however, that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and maintain the listing of the Notes on another “recognized stock exchange,” although there can be no assurance
that the Issuer will be able to do so.

In addition, although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing the Notes on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another recognized stock exchange in accordance with the
Indenture, failure to obtain approval for the listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another recognized stock exchange, as applicable, may have a material adverse
effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_No assurance can be given that the Notes will be listed or that, once listed, such listing will be maintained or_**
**_that such listing will satisfy the listing requirement of Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996._**

No assurance can be given that the Notes will be listed or that, once listed, the listing will be maintained or that
such listing will satisfy the listing requirement of Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 in order for
the Notes to be eligible to benefit from the provisions of such legislation relating to the exemption from the
requirement to apply withholding tax.

The Italian tax authorities have issued an interpretive circular relating to, among other things, the listing
requirement of the aforementioned legislation in order for the Notes to be eligible to benefit from the exemption
from withholding tax. According to a stringent interpretation of this circular, the Notes may not be eligible to
benefit from such provisions if the listing of the Notes is not effective as of the Issue Date. In the event that the

-----

Notes are not listed as of the Issue Date or that such listing requirement is otherwise not satisfied, payments of
interest, premium and other income with respect to the Notes would be subject to a withholding tax (ritenuta a
_titolo di imposta o acconto) currently at a rate of 26%, and we would be required to pay additional amounts with_
respect to such withholding taxes such that beneficial owners receive a net amount that is not less than the
amount that they would have received in the absence of such withholding. We cannot assure you that the listing
can be achieved by the Issue Date. However, we intend to achieve the required listing of the Notes on the Issue
Date by obtaining a listing on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The imposition of
withholding taxes with respect to payments on the Notes and the resulting obligation to pay additional amounts
to noteholders could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**Summary**

**_General_**

Multiversity is the market leader in Italy in the e-learning market by number of enrolled students with a 40%
market share of the Italian online undergraduate higher education market for the 2019/2020 academic year
capturing approximately 3% of the total Italian undergraduate market.[38] It operates two private online
universities, Pegaso and Mercatorum, a certification entity, Certipass and a number of academies as well as an
international lifelong learning higher education institution based in Malta. It delivers its services through a
proprietary online platform that carries out the e-learning contents produced in-house.

Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A., held by Multiversity, is the promoter and supporter of Pegaso,
Multiversity’s primary education institution. Approximately 105,000 students were enrolled in one of Pegaso’s
online courses for the 2020-2021 academic year. Pegaso offers a range of both undergraduate and postgraduate
courses, and in particular, seven undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single
cycle five-year degree and 139 postgraduate master’s courses as well as a number of higher education and
specialization courses for professionals and high school graduates. Pegaso also offers six individual certifications
and gives students the possibility to undertake single examinations for each course module upon payment of a fee
without having to complete the full course.

Multiversity’s other key institution, Mercatorum, is held indirectly by Multiversity through its 66.66% stake in
the share capital of Unimercatorum S.r.l. as the promoter and supporter of Mercatorum, with the remaining
33.33% stake in Unimercatorum S.r.l. is held indirectly by Unioncamere. Unioncamere, the Italian Union of
Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and Agriculture, is the public body that unites and institutionally
represents the Italian system of chambers of commerce. Approximately 23,000 students were enrolled in
Mercatorum for the 2020-2021 academic year. Mercatorum’s core offering currently consists of 14
undergraduate bachelor’s degrees (two of which are newly accredited and are therefore being offered for the first
time in the 2021/2022 academic year), four specialist master’s degrees, one Ph.D. and 11 postgraduate master’s
courses. Like Pegaso, it also allows students to undertake single examinations for any course module offered
within its curricula.

Other assets of Multiversity include Certipass, as provider of international certifications for digital competences
and IT skills, and an ever-growing number of academies established through collaboration agreements between
Pegaso and Mercatorum and their respective commercial partners, covering a wide range of specialist subjects
such as marketing, communications and media and teaching. In addition, Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l. (“Principe
**di Napoli”) was established in February 2019 by Pegaso in partnership with Mercatorum (holding 90% and 10%**
stakes, respectively) as a center for higher education and specialization in the sectors of gastronomy and tourism.

Apart from the Postgraduate School in Legal Professions (as further described below), Principe di Napoli is one
of the few institution within Multiversity to hold on premise courses.

Multiversity also operates a publishing entity and companies dedicated to research, which are mostly ancillary
and in support of the two universities. Almost the entirety of its operations are located in Italy, with some limited
operations in Malta. It also has collaboration agreements with several partners in Italy for the development and
delivery of specialized courses in a multitude of subjects, made available through its two universities.

Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €188.7 million, as
compared to €138.8 million[39] for the prior financial year (an increase of 36%), while Multiversity’s revenues for
the six months ended June 30, 2021 were €133.8 million, as compared to €98.1 million in the same period of the
prior financial year (an increase of 36%). Undergraduate enrolled students increased by approximately 50% in
the 2020/2021 academic year with respect to the previous academic year. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA
generated for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €102.3 million as compared to €74.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 (an increase of 37%), while Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021
was equal to €84.7 million, as compared to €57.4 million in the same period of the prior financial year.

Approximately 98% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated by Pegaso
(which accounted for 89% of Multiversity’s revenues) and Mercatorum (which accounted for 9% of
Multiversity’s revenues). By comparison, approximately 98% of Multiversity’s revenues for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 were generated by Pegaso (which accounted for 81% of Multiversity’s revenues) and
Mercatorum (which accounted for 17% of Multiversity’s revenues). The below diagram charts the growth in
revenues of Pegaso, Mercatorum and Multiversity’s other assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020:

In order to support their online offering, Multiversity’s institutions have an extensive network of approximately
3,000[40] e-learning center points as at September 30, 2021 across each of Pegaso (the “ELCP Points”),
Mercatorum (the “Ei-Points”) and Certipass (the “EIPASS Points” and, together with ELCP Points and
Ei-Points, the “ELCPs”). The ELCPs provide information to prospective and current students about the various
institutions, and in particular, Pegaso and Mercatorum’s ELCP Points and the Ei-Points, among other things,
serve as orientation centers for new students throughout the entire duration of the course they undertake. The
ELCP Points and the Ei-Points performed orientation activities for approximately 60% of Multiversity’s
institution’s new students, however the relevant institution retains the direct relationship with student as it
manages the enrollment process and tuition fee payments directly with the student[41]. As regards Certipass’
EIPASS Points, these purchase EIPASS cards from Certipass and on-sell them to customers who wish to obtain
an EIPASS certification. All ELCPs are managed by external third parties that have entered into specific
accreditation agreements with Pegaso, Mercatorum or Certipass (in some cases, more than one institution has
entered into an accreditation agreement with the same ELCP). See “Material Contracts—Accreditation
_Agreements for ELCPs” below._

**_Business Model_**

Multiversity’s business model is based on a student-centric offering of a flexible learning experience and access
to teaching content through our proprietary and technologically advanced e-learning platform. Both Pegaso and
Mercatorum address a specific unmet demand in the market for a flexible path to an undergraduate degree, whilst
catering to specific professions for postgraduate continuous learning.

40 Some entities perform services for, and have entered into accreditation agreements with, more than one of Pegaso, Mercatorum and
Certipass.

###### PEGASO


-----

Revenues are mainly driven by tuition fees paid by students to Pegaso and Mercatorum, which contributed to
77%[42] of Multiversity’s revenues. The levels of tuition fees in turn depend on the number of students, the nature
or class of degree undertaken, the year of enrollment, the type of course and the student’s selected enrollment
channel, amongst other factors. Undergraduate degrees, which are multi-year courses (three year bachelor’s
degree plus a two year specialist master’s degree, or a single-cycle five year degree), are a recurring multi-year
revenue stream for the term of the program (consisting of both the tuition fees and any other ancillary fees),
which has an average course length of 2.8 years. Approximately 40% of graduates from Pegaso and Mercatorum
who have completed three year undergraduate degree courses wish to continue their education and apply to enroll
in two year specialist master’s degree and master’s degree courses with the same institution. Undergraduate
tuition fees accounted for 54% of Pegaso’s revenues and 80% of Mercatorum’s revenues in the financial year
ended December 31, 2020, and 62% of Pegaso’s revenues and 85% of Mercatorum’s revenues for the six months
ended June 30, 2021.

On the other hand, one-year postgraduate master’s courses (i.e. second level master’s which may be undertaken
by students who have already completed a three year undergraduate bachelor’s degree plus a two year specialist
master’s degree or a single-cycle five year degree) together with Multiversity’s FIT offering (i.e. teacher training
courses) provide a one-off tuition fee payment per student, accounting for 20% of Pegaso’s revenues and 4% of
Mercatorum’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 and 12% of Pegaso’s revenues and 6%
of Mercatorum’s revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Various other services offered to students
provide additional revenue such as fees payable in order to take examinations in an alternative location, and
certificates—such additional services accounted for approximately 20% of Pegaso’s revenues and 8% of
Mercatorum’s revenues, in each case for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 and 26% of Pegaso’s
revenues and 11% of Mercatorum’s revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Single exams contributed
to 4% of Pegaso’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with 3%. for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 (whereas single exams generally contribute less than 1% towards Mercatorum’s revenues).

Multiversity’s growth strategy is based on expanding volumes by increasing market penetration within the
population, whilst selectively increasing its course offering, its brand awareness, digital marketing practices and
_ad hoc orientation services to prospective students as well as by entering into commercial agreements and_
partnerships falling into two main categories:

- agreements with corporations, law enforcement, governmental bodies and public administration authorities
providing for the application of lower corporate rates to their employees (and, in certain instances, their
family members) and, in some cases, for the creation and implementation of employee training programs,
thereby incentivizing such employees to attend courses in order to accelerate their career paths or to comply
with the ongoing professional development requirements set up by regulators or employers; and

- partnerships with private companies and public entities aimed at the development of specialized courses
using the partners’ know-how and branding, coupled with Multiversity’s online e-learning platform,
teaching know-how and, in certain instances, its academic staff. These agreements give rise, for example, to
the specialist academies forming part of Pegaso and Mercatorum’s higher education offering, as further
described below.

Multiversity has established a nation-wide presence, with Pegaso’s approximately 100 exam venues located in
prestigious or historical buildings, Mercatorum’s leveraging of the system of the Italian chambers of commerce
and the institutions’ network of approximately 3,000 ELCPs, along with a strong online social community and
proprietary technology platforms for online classes, exams and tutoring.

The main objective underpinning Multiversity’s business strategy is to consolidate its market position and
become the leading entirely online education group in the Italian markets, employing both Business-to-Consumer
and Business-to-Business marketing strategies in order to target an ever-wider audience of students. See further
“—Key Strengths” and “—Strategies” below.

**Key Factors Affecting Multiversity’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations**

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations have been affected in the periods under review, and are expected to continue to be
affected, by various key factors relating to our business and industry, which we describe below. For further
discussion of the factors affecting our results of operations, see “Risk Factors.”

42 Excluding any fees payable by students for ancillary services, such as supplemental tuition fee or the alternative exam location fee, in
each case described under “—Offering—Ancillary Fees and Services” below

-----

**_Macroeconomic Conditions_**

During the financial year ended December 31, 2020 almost all of our revenues were derived from our operations
in Italy and the macroeconomic environment in Italy has a direct impact on our results of our operations. Due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions have been imposed globally leading to shutdowns of non-essential
commercial activities with Italy being one of the most affected European countries recording a negative change
in GDP in 2020 of 8.9% due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the economic downturn triggered by COVID-19 pandemic certain industry sectors remained resilient.
The IT and telecommunications grew by 15.3% compared to 2019 due to the establishment of flexible working
models, the introduction of online learning in all Italian schools and Italians’ need for leisure activities to cope
with the stay-at-home restrictions imposed by the Italian government. In addition, the recent vaccination
campaigns in Italy and throughout Europe along with governmental recovery funding are expected to produce
macroeconomic results. According to the International Monetary Fund economic forecasts the global economy is
expected to grow at 6.0% and 4.9% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. In particular, Italy could benefit from the EU
Recovery and Resilience Facility which allocated approximately €46.0 billion to be used in Italy for
digitalization, innovation, competitiveness and culture. We believe that these positive economic trends could be
favorable for our business model and financial performance.

**_Market trends and Demand for Online Education_**

In the academic year 2019/2020, according to MIUR, approximately 309,000 new students enrolled at the Italian
universities, which represents an increase of approximately 10,000 (or 3.3%) compared to the previous academic
year and an increase of approximately 40,000 (or 14.7%) compared to the level recorded over the last decade.
The increase in the number of new students for the academic year 2019/2020 is mainly recorded with respect to
the three-year and master’s degree programmes with approximately 276,000 students, representing 89.2% of total
enrolments, representing an increase of approximately 4% over the previous academic year. The increase in new
enrolments at Italian universities is driven by a number of factors such as a constant increase in the number of
new graduates who continue their education at the Italian universities and also the rapid growth of enrolments
registered at online universities. The COVID-19 pandemic also incentivized students to enroll in distance
learning programmes which stimulated the new online learning models. The online universities are pioneering
this process as they are the key promoters of flexible learning models.

We observed favourable market trends in recent years with respect to successful completion of academic studies.
In 2009 39.2% of the graduates completed their studies on time whereas in the academic year 2019/2020 the
number of such graduates reached 55.7%, with 61.0% having completed two-year master programmes, 56.1%
represented first level graduates and 43.5% completed single-cycle masters. In addition, the number of students
who did not complete their studies on time also decreased by half over the last decade representing just 8.1% of
all students.

We observe closely these recent market trends and the increased number of students and the increased demand
for online education. We have developed our technological platform and we offer personalizing open-source
software able to deliver seamlessly across all platforms and devices so that we can meet the increased demand for
online education.

**_Key Performance Indicators_**

The demographic profile of our student is a key operational metrics to manage our educational institutions. We
monitor the age, year of enrolment, origin and geography of our students as we believe that they are the most
reliable metrics for measuring the profitability of our educational institutions.

The tables below sets out our key operating data for the academic years 2020/2021 and 2018/2019 for Pegaso
and Mercatorum on combined basis relevant for both the new students enrolled in undergraduate courses and the
postgraduate courses. Undergraduates make up the majority of our student population. We observe high
incidence of i) younger generations and first-timers (which have been and are expected to increase in the near
future) and ii) students from Southern Italy (as a reflection of our original footprint; now rapidly expanding into
the North).

Our student base enrolled in undergraduate course is mainly composed of young students (aged 18-34),
representing approximately 70% of the total number of enrolled undergraduate students in the academic year
2020/2021, as compared to approximately 60% in the academic year 2018/2019, and we recorded 52% young
students enrolled in postgraduate courses in the academic year 2020/2021.

result, the income statement for the 2019 Multiversity Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements covers
only the period since inception to the end of the year of Multiversity stand alone as allowed by Italian GAAP, as
the first consolidation date was December 31, 2019. The financial results of Multiversity Group are presented on
a fully consolidated basis for the first time for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, currently
Multiversity owns 50% of the share capital of Certipass and Certipass is included in Multiversity’s consolidated
financial statements using the proportional method. Following the Acquisition, Multiversity will own 100% of
the share capital of Certipass and it will be fully consolidated into Multiversity Group financial statements. These
factors affected the comparability of our financial results between periods and the financial statements of
Multiversity Group in the future will vary from the historical consolidated financial statements for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

We account for acquisitions using the equity method of accounting and the original cost of the investment
changes in the periods following the acquisition of the investment taking into account the profits and losses and
other changes in the shareholders’ equity of the investee. On that basis the book value of equity investments is
consolidated using line-by-line method elimination against the corresponding share of shareholders’ equity, less
the result for the year, at the date of first inclusion in the consolidation. The difference between the acquisition
cost and the net equity at fair value of the subsidiaries at the consolidation date is allocated, where possible, to
the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries net of deferred taxes, where applicable; any remaining difference, if
positive and if the requirements for recording goodwill provided for by OIC 24 are met, is recognised in the item
‘Goodwill’ within intangible assets. The residual difference that cannot be allocated to assets and liabilities and
to goodwill is charged to the income statement under item “B14 Other operating expenses”.

**_Description of Key Line Items and Certain Key Performance Indicators of Multiversity_**

**Value of production**

The value of production primarily comprises the operating income deriving from the educational offerings of
Pegaso and Mercatorum, as well as from Certipass (historically controlled at 50% and included in the
consolidated financial statements using the proportional method). These include fees for enrolment in degree,
postgraduate and single courses, contributions from students, off-site exams, issuing diplomas and certificates,
and training courses.

Revenue from sales and services are recognized on the basis of the relevant accrual principles and are shown as
net of returns, discounts, rebates and premiums.

Other revenues and income mainly concern grants related to university research projects and to ancillary services
relating to the educational offerings of Pegaso and Mercatorum, and for 2020 the release of provisions for risks
and charges as a result of the fact that the risk for which the provision was made in previous years no longer
exists.

**Costs of production**

Operating costs comprise the direct and indirect costs attributable to our operations and mainly include the costs
of services, costs for use of third party assets, personnel costs, other operating expenses and amortization,
depreciation and write-downs.

_Costs of services_

The largest components of costs of services are advertising and contributions to guidance centers. Costs of
services also include teaching, the corporate bodies compensation, technical and financial advisory fees,
insurance, bank and postal charges, utilities, maintenance and other costs, and contribution to ELCPs.

_Costs for use of third party assets_

The cost for use of third party assets primarily relates to rental costs for the offices of the universities of the
Multiversity Group and rental of cars and other equipment used in the operating activities of the Multiversity
Group and for Pegaso, royalties for use of the Multiversity name and platform.

_Personnel costs_

The cost of personnel reflects all expenses for employees including wages and salaries, social security charges,
the cost of unused holidays, legal provisions and collective agreements.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses mainly include costs for stamp duty, donations to organisations and associations,
various taxes and duties and contingent liabilities.

83


-----

_Amortization, depreciation and write-downs_

The most significant component of amortization, depreciation and write-downs is the amortization of intangible
assets. This is mainly comprised of the amortization of goodwill and also contains the amortization of
trademarks, platforms and other rights. Amortization, depreciation and write-downs also includes write-downs
for bad debt, provisions, and depreciation of plant, property and equipment.

Depreciation and amortization are determined on a straight-line basis to the historical cost, including directly
attributable accessory charges, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, respectively, with
goodwill being depreciated over 20 years. Write-downs for impairment of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets is recognised when their recoverable value is lower than their book value. Write-downs of trade
receivables are recognised to align their carrying amount to their presumed realisable value and in connection
with losses incurred.

**Financial income and expenses**

Financial income and expenses include all the positive and negative components, respectively, of the results for
the year connected with the financial activity of the Group and are recognised on the basis of the accrual
principle. Financial income is largely comprised of the discounting of receivables and financial expenses is
primarily comprised of interest expense on trade payables.

**Income taxes**

Current income taxes are allocated according to the accrual principle on the basis of the income tax charges
resulting from the application of tax legislation in force and are reflected based on tax payables net of advances.

Deferred and prepaid taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the value attributed to the
tax assets and liabilities according to statutory criteria and the value attributed to the same assets and liabilities
for current tax purposes.

Deferred tax liabilities are entered in the ‘Provision for deferred taxes’, recorded under liabilities among the
provisions for risks and charges, while the deferred tax assets are recorded within the receivables from others
under current assets.

Deferred tax assets are not recognised, in compliance with the prudence principle, if there is not reasonable
certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be reversed, of a
taxable income higher than the amount of the differences that will be cancelled. Liabilities for deferred taxes are
recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year in which the tax asset
will be realised or the tax liability will be settled, based on the tax legislation established by the provisions in
force at the reporting date.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and other ratios**

Multiversity Group also uses certain additional key performance indicators, which in Multiversity Group’s view
provide an alternative additional measure with which to assess Multiversity Group’s underlying performance.
Multiversity Group’s definition may differ from those used by other companies; therefore comparability may be
limited. Such measures are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or
operating margin as a measure of operating performance. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

_Value of production_

The value of production increased by €35.7 million, or 36.4%, from €98.1 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2020 to €133.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by

85


-----

the increase in revenues from sales and services attributable to an increase in the tuition and other fees together
with the increase in the number of new students enrolled in degree courses.

Value of production also includes other revenues and income which decreased by €1.7 million, or 67.1%, from
€2.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to €0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The
decrease was primarily driven by lower ordinary windfall profits made by Pegaso and other companies of
Multiversity Group since the six-months ended June 30, 2020 included the release of provisions for risks and
charges accrued in previous years, which was partially offset by an increase in operating grants.

_Costs for services_

Costs for services increased by €5.8 million, or 19.0%, from €30.5 million for the six months ended June 30,
2020 to €36.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was the result of the growth of the
business that occurred in the first half of the current year (mainly ELCPs, promotional activities carried out by
the universities of the Group, bank charges and teachers’ fees) which was partially offset by operational
efficiencies such as utilities savings that are mostly due to the smart working activities that occurred in 2021. The
percentage incidence of costs for services to the value of production decreased from 31% in the first half of 2020
to 27% in the first half of 2021, since the above described increases were less than proportionally compared to
the increase the value of production, as well as the utilities savings.

_Costs for use of third party assets_

Cost for use of third party assets of Multiversity Group increased by €0.1 million, or 4.6%, from €2.1 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2020 to €2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily as a result
of: (i) the rent of new office spaces for Pegaso in the Naples headquarter in connection with the development of
the business; (ii) the relocation of some Mercatorum offices, in Rome, and (iii) opening some new Pegaso sites in
Rome.

Cost of personnel

Personnel costs increased by €2.2 million, or 36.9%, from €5.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to
€8.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in the
number of employees of the main universities of the Group, Pegaso and Mercatorum in line with revenue growth.

Amortization and depreciation were steady at €18.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and the six
months ended June 30, 2021. Write-downs increased by €1.0 million, or 37.8%, from €2.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2020 to €3.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 as a result of the increase in
the outstanding receivables driven by the higher number of students.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses of Multiversity Group decreased by €4.0 million, or 63.4%, from €6.3 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2020 to €2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This decrease was the
result of the payment of a settlement in 2020 with the main ELCPs, which provides for the consensual
termination of the agreements in place.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by €30.8 million, or 61.3%, from €50.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to
€81.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by our increase in

86


-----

revenue as well as an improvement in margins driven by operating leverage in cost of services and a reduction in
other operating expenses. For the reconciliation of EBITDA with financial statements see “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information.”_

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial income and expenses of Multiversity Group declined 60.0%, from an expense of €20 thousand for the
six months ended June 30, 2020 to €8 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

Taxes for the period

Income taxes of Multiversity Group increased by €0.7 million, from €14.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2020 to €15.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was driven by higher
current income taxes of €9.4 million due to a higher taxable base as a result of the expansion of the business,
whose effect is partially offset by the release of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the exercise of the
option to realign since January 1, 2021 the fiscal and accounting value of intangibles pursuant to art. 110 of the
Italian Legislative Decree dated August 14, 2020. In connection with such realignment Multiversity paid a
substitute tax of €0.9 million.

_Value of production_

The value of production of Multiversity Group increased by €51.2 million, or 36.8%, from €138.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 to €190.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was
primarily attributable to revenue derived from the educational offerings of the Universities of the Multiversity
Group, in particular Pegaso and Mercatorum, as well as the certification company, Certipass (historically
controlled at 50% and included in the consolidated financial statements using the proportional method). Pegaso is
the largest single contributor to Multiversity’s results and accounted for 89% of Multiversity’s revenues and 86%
of Multiversity’s Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended December 31, 2020. Mercatorum accounted for
9% of Multiversity’s revenues and 6% of Multiversity’s Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended
December 31, 2020.

The increase was primarily driven by sustained undergraduate growth, which contribute a higher revenue per
student (higher tuition-fee and ancillary services linked to them) and student duration, which completely offset
the lower volumes in postgraduate linked to the seasonality of FIT (specific type of master’s).

_Pegaso_

With regard to degree courses, during 2020, (i) Pegaso experienced a significant increase in the number of
enrolments, and (ii) two new degree courses were accredited during the year, which have been well received by
new students. The degree course with the highest growth in 2020 is the Sport Management and Sport Sciences
course, which ranks fourth among the degree courses with the highest number of new students in Italy, with an
increase in the number of students of 81.4% compared to the previous year. The Safety Engineering and
Educational Sciences courses performed in line with the trends of Italian students and the degree courses in
engineering and teaching were among the most popular in Italian universities.

_Mercatorum_

As for Mercatorum, the university recorded a strong increase in revenues due to: (i) the training offer which was
significantly expanded in 2020 with the addition of 5 new study courses (3 three-year and 2 master’s); (ii) strong
growth in enrolled students, showing a CAGR in excess of 100% between the academic year 2019/2020 and the
academic year 2020/2021.

The Professional Criminologist Advanced Training Course, is the most popular due to the highly topical nature
of the subject (it also allows enrollment in the second year of the Legal Sciences Degree course). Moreover, the
Higher Education and Specialization Courses constitute a significant growth asset for the University, becoming a
strategic tool for building student loyalty.

The following table shows the number of students enrolled at each of Pegaso and Mercatorum for the academic
years 2019/2020 and 2020/2021:

**Academic Year** **Growth y/y (%)**

In addition, the table below shows the breakdown of the total number of students of each of Pegaso and
Mercatorum for each of the academic years 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 by type of academic course.

The absolute number of enrollments is not reflective of the weight on revenue of the courses. The evolution of
the student base highlights a fast-growing trend in the undergraduate degree offering, which represents the largest
contributor to revenue given the higher tuition fee and duration of the students’ academic career (undergraduate
degrees tend to have a duration spanning from three to five years, while postgraduate courses and individual
courses mostly last one year), whilst showing a decline in enrollments in postgraduate individual courses. The

88


-----

latter is due to the seasonality effect linked to public tenders (“concorsi pubblici”) for specific professions such
as teachers. Such public tenders are usually carried out every two years by the public administration and
therefore the decrease in enrollments for the 2020/2021 academic year is expected to be recovered once the
tenders are announced once again in the coming year. Such expected recovery will be further positively affected
by the expected increase in hirings in the public education sector in Italy.

Value of production include other revenues and income of Multiversity Group decreased by €0.1 million, or
5.1%, from €2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €2.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 and were primarily associated with a reduction in contributions related to university research projects which
was largely offset by the release of provisions for risks and charges, as a result of the fact that the risk for which
the provision was made in previous years no longer exists, and other contingent assets.

_Costs for services_

Cost of services of Multiversity Group increased by €19.6 million, or 43.1%, from €45.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €65.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly includes costs for
contributions relating to university guidance centres for an amount of approximately €23.6 million, costs incurred
for promotional activities for an amount equal to approximately €26.8 million, fees to the corporate bodies and
the academic evaluation team equal to roughly €1.37 million, technical, legal and administrative consultancy for
an amount of approximately €845 thousand, insurance and bank charges amounting to around €1.13 million and
other services connected with the operational management of the various Group companies.

Regarding costs for services, Pegaso accounts for 86% and Mercatorum for 9%. The increase was primarily
driven by higher costs incurred for promotional activities to support the Multiversity Group’s brands to drive
further growth (which increase by more than 100% in both Pegaso and Mercatorum) and higher contributions
paid to ELCPs in connection with the increase in the University’s activities (which increased by more than 100%
in Mercatorum, while showing an increase of approximately 5% in Pegaso).

_Costs for use of third party assets_

Costs for use of third party assets of Multiversity Group decreased by €0.6 million, or 11.7%, from €5.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to rental costs
for the numerous offices of the universities of the Multiversity Group, which amounted to approximately
€3.2 million, while the remainder was mainly attributable to the rental of cars and other equipment necessary for
the performance of the operating activities of the companies of the Group.

_Cost of personnel_

Personnel costs of Multiversity Group increased by €4.4 million, or 47.5%, from €9.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven
by the increase in the educational and administrative staff employed, as a result of revenue growth. The year
2020 was characterised by the consolidation of relations with the new shareholder represented by the CVC
Capital Partners private equity fund and by the completion of the corporate reorganisation already launched in
the previous year, to allow entry and integration into the capital of the Multiversity of the new financial partner.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses of Multiversity Group increased by €4.8 million, from €3.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was largely a result of a
subsidiary Pegaso agreeing in March 2020 to a settlement with certain ELCPs, which provided for the consensual
termination of the agreements in place effective from January 1, 2020, based on the payment of a total amount of
€4.0 million, in the form of compensation, and a total consideration of approximately €16.6 thousand per month,
plus VAT, for the entire five-year duration of a series of obligations undertaken by the relevant ELCPs, including
the obligation of not undertaking activities in competition with those of the university. The transaction was
entered into on the basis of the decision to bring in-house the main activities carried out by these ELCPs. This
transaction was part of the reorganisation of the Multiversity Group’s structure aiming to optimise internal
processes.

in the value of production by 22%, whose effect was partially offset by the reduction in other revenues and
income by 92% due to the positive not recurring effect of a provision release in profit and loss 2018.

€0.2 million, or 34%, compared to the previous year; and (ii) other sundry revenue of €0.1 million (€18.0 million
in 2018), which decreased by €17.9 million, mainly due to the fact the in 2018 they included a release of

2020, respectively), which has been adjusted for non-cash expenses and income, namely (i) income taxes
(€15.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021; €14.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020);
(ii) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets (€18.1 million for six months ended June 30, 2021;

the six months ended June 30, 2021; €2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020) that were made by
estimating the amounts of credits accrued for which there is a risk of recoverability. Such effects were partially
offset by an increase in net working capital due to: (i) a decrease in trade receivables as a result of the
universities students payments tranche scheduling; (ii) a decrease in the negative balance of other current assets
and liabilities, mainly as a result of the reduction of accrued liabilities and deferred income due to the turnover
growth.

ended June 30, 2020 to €0.9 million outflow for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The change is mainly due to
a decrease in intangible assets (€0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021; €2.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2020) and in financial fixed assets (€0.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021;

Total cash flow from operating activities of Multiversity Group increased by €38.5 million, from €54.6 million in
the year ended December 31, 2019 to €93.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is
primarily due to increase in EBITDA for the year and net working capital going from €21.0 million outflow in
the year ended December 31, 2019 to €3.5 million outflow in the year ended December 31, 2020. This change in
net working capital was the result of a decrease in the negative balance of other current assets and liabilities,
mainly related to the reduction of payables to employees and to the tax authorities, partially offset by an increase
in trade receivables due to higher sales during the course of the year.

Total cash flow from operating activities of Pegaso increased by €16.1 million, from €46.7 million in the year
ended December 31, 2018 to €62.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulting from the €19.4 million
decrease of non-monetary items that in 2018 are represented by the release of provisions for risks and charges for
a value of approximately €18.0 million. Cash used for net working capital was €2.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019 compared to €3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, largely as a result of an

expenses in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Negative Net Working Capital amounted to €51.0 million for the period ended June 30, 2021 compared to
€43.9 million for the year ended December 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in trade
receivables as result of the universities students’ payments tranche scheduling, partially offset by a decrease in
the negative balance of other current assets and liabilities, mainly related to the reduction of accrued liabilities
and deferred income due to turnover growth.

and to the tax authorities, partially offset by an increase in trade receivables due to higher sales in the year.

The above data refer exclusively to the commitments undertaken by the Group with respect to the lease
agreements.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

The Group activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including credit risk and liquidity risk. The risk
management policy, which is managed centrally by the senior management, focuses on minimizing the potential
adverse effects on our financial performance. The following section discusses the significant financial risks to
which the Group is exposed. This discussion does not address any other risks to which it is exposed to in the
normal course of business such as operational risks. See “Risk Factors.”

**_Interest rate risk_**

The Group will be subject to interest rate market risk in connection with its long-term debt. The Group’s
principal interest rate exposure will relate to variable rate borrowings under the Notes and its Bridge to Cash
Facility. To the extent that EURIBOR is in excess of the 0.00% floor rate, each one basis point change in interest
rates would result in an approximately €102,530 change in annual interest expense on the funded indebtedness
under the Notes, amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Bridge to Cash Facility.

**_Credit Risk_**

Following the credit monitoring activity carried out on a timely basis by the administrative offices of the group
companies, overdue credit collection activities are constantly implemented. The value of the receivables is
constantly monitored during the year, and if needed a provision for the estimated uncollectable receivable is
accrued so that the amount expresses the presumed realisable value.

**_Liquidity Risk and Risk of Changes in Cash Flows_**

Our management body constantly monitors the trends in cash flows through an adequate financial planning
system. After the transactions are executed, a certain portion of our cash flows will be absorbed by the repayment
of principles and interests of the borrowings entering into in connection with the acquisition.

**_Tax risk_**

All Group companies constantly monitor their tax position and implement risk management associated with
prudent tax policies. On November 20, 2019, a tax audit was conducted by the Revenue Agency (see
“Business—Litigation and legal, tax and administrative proceedings”).

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum contain a description of certain
significant accounting policies of Multiversity S.r.l. which require the Group to make estimates and assumptions
that affect reported results and disclosures. The Group believes the following items are critical accounting
policies. “Critical accounting policies” means policies that are both important to the portrayal of the Group’s
financial performance and financial results, and that require critical management judgments and estimates in
relation to matters that are inherently uncertain. The estimates and assumptions are based on experience and
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are used to judge the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The most critical accounting policies involving a
higher degree of judgment and complexity in applying principles of valuation and for which changes in the
assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results than those recorded in the financial

-----

statements included elsewhere in the Offering Memorandum. Although we believe that our discretionary
judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from our estimates.

**_Write-downs for impairment of tangible and intangible assets_**

At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indicator to suggest a fixed asset may have
suffered impairment. If these indicators were to exist, the Group would estimate the recoverable value of the
asset by making a write-down only if the latter were lower than the corresponding net book value. In the absence
of indicators of potential impairment, the recoverable value is not determined.

When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the Group estimates the
recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and its value in use determined
as the present value of estimated future cash flows.

An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value. When, subsequently, a loss on
assets, other than goodwill, ceases or is reduced, the book value of the asset or the cash-generating unit is
increased up to the new estimate of the recoverable value without exceeding the value that would have been
determined if no loss had been detected.

**_Receivables_**

Receivables originating from revenues for the sale of goods or the provision of services are recognised under
current assets on the basis of the accrual principle when the conditions for the recognition of the related revenues
are met.

The revenue recognition policy is set out below.

Most of the revenues are deferred on the basis of the academic year which starts on August 1 and ends on July 31
of the following year, calculating the actual days.

Revenues deriving from “OLD” students (students already enrolled in the previous year) are accounted for at the
beginning of the new academic year (August 1) and deferred for the entire period (until July 31).

Revenues deriving from “NEW” students (new students enrolled) are accounted for at the time of registration to
the university, which can take place at any time during the academic year, and are deferred for the remaining
period (until July 31, end of the academic year).

FIT revenues are not deferred on the basis of the academic years but according to the following percentages: 50%
/ 25% / 25% respectively in the accounting month and in the following 2 months.

The other types of revenue are directly accounted for in the billing month and therefore are not deferred (as for
EIPASS revenues).

Receivables originating for different reasons are recognised if there is a ‘title’ to the receivable and therefore
when they actually represent a third-party obligation to the company; if of a financial nature they are classified
under financial fixed assets, with an indication of the portion due within the next fiscal year.

Receivables are valued in the financial statements at amortized cost, taking into account the time factor, and
within the limits of their presumed realisable value and, therefore, are shown in the balance sheet net of the
related bad debt provision deemed adequate to cover losses due to reasonably foreseeable non-collectability.

If the interest rate of the transaction is not significantly different from the market rate, the receivable is initially
recorded at a value equal to the nominal value net of all premiums, discounts, rebates and inclusive of any costs
directly attributable to the transaction, which generated the receivable. These transaction costs, any commission
income and expense and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are spread
over the duration of the loan using the effective interest criterion.

On the other hand, when the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is
significantly different from the market rate, the receivable (and the corresponding revenue in the case of
commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows plus any
transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate.

In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition
value of the receivable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as financial
income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate criterion.

101


-----

In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the
present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial
income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the
transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest
income accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement
with the value of the receivable as a contra entry.

The value of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the amounts received, both by way of principal and
interest, as well as for any write-downs to bring the receivables back to their presumed realisable value or for
losses.

The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortized cost and the discounting back
are not relevant when the maturity of the receivables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the
contractual and substantial considerations in place on recognition of the receivable, and the transaction costs and
any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity is of an insignificant amount. In this
case, discounting was omitted, the interest was calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs were entered
among deferrals and amortized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the receivable to adjust the nominal
interest income.

**_Provisions for risks and charges_**

They are set aside to cover losses or debts of certain or probable existence, whose amount or date of occurrence
could not be determined at the end of the year.

In the measurement of these provisions, the general criteria of prudence and accrual accounting are respected,
and no provision was made for generic risks without economic justification.

Contingent liabilities are recognised in the financial statements and booked under provisions when they are likely
to materialise and when the amount of the related charge can be reasonably estimated.

Any risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible or for which no objective forecast of the
resulting charge is possible are indicated in the explanatory notes of the financial statements without allocating
provisions for risks and charges.

Risks whose probability of occurrence appears remote are not taken into account.

**_Income taxes—Current, Prepaid and Deferred_**

Current income taxes are allocated according to the accrual principle on the basis of the tax charges resulting
from the application of the tax legislation in force and are entered among tax payables net of advances.

Deferred and prepaid taxes are determined on the temporary differences between the value attributed to the assets
and liabilities according to statutory criteria and the value attributed to the same assets and liabilities for tax
purposes.

Deferred taxes are entered in the ‘Provision for deferred taxes’, recorded under liabilities among the provisions
for risks and charges, while the prepaid taxes are recorded in the receivables from others under current assets.

Assets deriving from prepaid taxes are not recognised, in compliance with the prudence principle, if there is no
reasonable certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be
reversed, of a taxable income higher than the amount of the differences that will be cancelled. Liabilities for
deferred taxes are recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will reverse in the foreseeable
future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year
in which the tax asset will be realised or the tax liability will be settled, based on the tax legislation established
by the provisions in force at the reporting date.

**_Accruals and deferrals_**

The portions of costs and income common to two or more fiscal years, according to the matching and accrual
principle, are recorded in these items. Based on this criterion, accruals or deferrals are recognised when the
following conditions are met:

- the contract begins in one fiscal year and ends in a subsequent one;

- the consideration for the services is contractually due in advance or in arrears with respect to services
common to two or more consecutive years;

- the amount of accruals and deferrals varies with the passage of time.

Income and charges that have accrued in full in the fiscal year to which the financial statements refer or in
subsequent ones are not included among accruals and deferrals.

**The Italian higher education market is predominantly composed of traditional physical universities, most**
**of which are public, with online (private only) universities emerging over the last decades**

The Italian higher education market is broad and developed, home of some of the oldest universities ever
established. In Italy there are 68 public universities mostly located in major urban areas. These do not have
admission tests, with the exception of specific courses (such as medicine and architecture) and have annual
tuition in the range of approximately €350—€3,000 per annum, depending on students’ wealth. There are 19
private traditional universities, with higher average tuition fees (approximately €3,000—€15,000) and mostly
with some sort of admission test or criteria based on the students’ academic performance in high school. Online
universities, which are solely private, represent a smaller segment of 11 universities, with no admission test (also
driven by the fact that there are no limitations associated with physical space availability) and with average
annual tuition between approximately €750—€5,000.

The Italian university market, initially closed to online universities, was officially opened to online competition
in 2003 (but only started operating in 2006). On April 17, 2003, the Italian University Education and Research
Ministry, together with the Minister for Innovation and Technology, opened the higher education market to
online universities with courses delivered for the first time in 2006, in an effort to increase the number of people
holding a higher education degree and offer a more flexible path to students.

Since the opening of the online Italian higher education market in 2003, 11 online private universities were
established (including Pegaso and Mercatorum) and today they enroll approximately 190,000 students (academic
year 2019/2020)[43]. There are no public online universities and the online university market is structurally closed
to new entrants, as no further licenses are currently expected to be issued. In particular, the ban for the
establishment of online universities in Italy is usually extended every three years, with the publication of the
Ministerial Decree governing Italian universities’ academic planning. The latest Ministerial Decree published in
March 2021 (Decree n. 289 of 25 March 2021) confirmed the ban until 2023.

**Despite improvements in the recent years, Italy still remains the developed country with the lowest tertiary**
**education penetration and a considerably high drop-out rate, coupled with one of the lowest online**
**penetrations in Europe**

Despite improvements in the recent years, Italy still remains the developed country with the lowest tertiary
education penetration among its population aged 25-34 years old (27.7% in 2019) with significant gaps compared
to the OECD average of 44.9% and some of the most penetrated countries worldwide (UK of 51.8%, US of
50.4%, France of 48.1%, and Spain of 46.5%)[44].

The Italian higher education market is quite different when compared to other European markets. Aside for the
low graduate penetration, Italy also has a considerably high drop-out rate for upper secondary and tertiary
education and training with a sizeable gap compared with the EU average. The Italian market, while improving
its drop-out rate in the past ten years, still displayed an approximately 13% drop-out rate in 2020 (of the
population aged 18-24 leaving early from their education), when compared to the approximately 10% EU
average and the goal to reach 9% at European level in 2030. When focusing on Italian tertiary education courses,
the highest drop-out rate is displayed among Bachelor’s degrees, with a 12.2% drop-out rate for the 2015/2016
cohort (in the first year) according to the National Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research

Institutes[45], followed by 5-year Master’s degrees at 7.5% and, finally, Master’s of Science with 5.9% (vs. 16.3%,
10.0%, and 7.7% respectively in 2007).

This is also due to structural factors, including a relatively wide territory with peripheral areas distant from urban
centres and therefore rendering university attendance more expensive (due to travel and accommodation costs) as
well as complicated for those students working at the same time.

Aside for the high drop-out rate, Italy has one of the lowest online penetrations in Europe and lacks robust
infrastructure to support critical digital developments in various sectors. The lack of sufficient digital coverage
has historically represented a major obstacle to the adoption of online education, especially for rural areas, where
access to traditional universities is often limited by logistical (long distance from university centres) and financial
(more expensive due to travel and accommodation costs) complexities. Furthermore, the career path for a student
in Italy tends to be longer and less flexible than those of many other EU countries, due to a focus on theoretical
subjects (for which exams take a longer time to prepare for, given their theoretical nature), a large proportion of
Italian universities only offering single exam dates per year (i.e. only one chance per year) and a higher
population living in peripheral or non-urban areas.

**The student base is overall resilient over time, with the traditional segment currently enrolling the**
**majority of students and the online segment growing and taking share from traditional education and**
**unlocking additional unmet demand**

The overall Italian student population enrolled in higher education has reached approximately 1.9 million students as
of academic year 2019/2020[48], of which 95% are in the undergraduate market and 5% in the postgraduate master’s.
The population increased by approximately 130,000 students between academic year 2015/2016 and academic year
2019/2020, but while over these years the traditional university channel has remained substantially flat in terms of
enrolled students, the online one has materially increased its relevance and accounted for the vast majority of the
aforementioned growth. Today students enrolled in online universities represent approximately 10% of the total
market, a significant improvement since academic year 2015/2016 when it accounted for approximately 5% only.

Among the existing 11 online universities, a handful of players captured approximately 90%[49] and the top two
approximately 76% of the postgraduate students enrolled, respectively (academic year 2019/2020) and these
players drove the vast majority of the above mentioned growth in the past years.

Multiversity Group, owning the fastest growing players Pegaso and Mercatorum, is the market leader and has
contributed alone to over 55% of the growth of the online market since academic year 2015/2016 and it is
expected to continue to be the main contributor and beneficiary of the market future evolution.

**Italian higher education student enrolled base: recent growth mostly driven by online universities**

_Undergraduate_

Undergraduate education refers to university courses catering to students who have completed a high school
diploma and include 3-year Bachelor’s degrees (“triennale), 2-year Master’s degrees (“specialistica”) and 5-year
degrees (“ciclo unico” or “magistrale”, for law students). The Italian population enrolled in the undergraduate
market, currently representing 95%[50] of the total higher education base, has grown in the past 5 years at a 1%
annual rate and reached 1.8 million students in academic year 2019/2020, with online universities growing at
20% per annum over the same timeframe. This trend is also expected to continue in the future and, on the back of
an expected 19% annual growth rate for online universities, the total number of undergraduate students is
expected to exceed 2.0 million by academic year 2025/2026.

Online universities significantly increased their relevance in the market, representing 7.7% of the total
undergraduate population with approximately 135,000 enrolled students in academic year 2019/2020, a
significant improvement from 3.9% in academic year 2015/2016 and even more remarkable when considering
that this channel did not exist prior to 2006. On the back of favorable tailwinds, online penetration is expected to
further accelerate reaching 18.7% of the total market by academic year 2025/2026, adding over 240,000 online
students to current levels and reaching a total of approximately 379,000 students. COVID-19 serves as an
accelerator of growth, helping overcome potential scepticism around validity and efficacy of online education
and this is reflected in the strong market growth expected over the next two academic years (28% and 29% in
academic year 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 respectively). The new investments in digitalization aimed at covering
the significant white spaces across the country represent a further accelerator to reach an additional portion of the
population whose needs are currently unaddressed.

Multiversity, as a clear market leader in the undergraduate market thanks to Pegaso and Mercatorum, is set to drive
and benefit from such positive market momentum, on the back of its unique educational offer (both in terms of
quantity and quality), its best in class proprietary platform and user experience and an established brand name.

The underlying growth of the student base can be assessed from multiple angles, and a starting point is the
students’ profile:

Students who graduate at the end of their academic career, with a portion of
**Graduates** these who continue their studies into master's or other specialization courses **-**

**Churn** Drop-out students leaving studies without achieving graduation **-**

In the undergraduate market, first timers currently represent the largest source of total new additions for online
universities[52] (approximately 39% of the total), followed by returning drop-outs and transfers from traditional
universities. Attractiveness of online universities is further sustained by the fact that first timers will be the main
driver of growth (47% of new additions in academic year 2025/2026—according to forecasts). Increasing
relevance of first-timers will be positive for online universities as it will enhance revenue stability due to longer
duration of the student’s term.

With opposite effect to the student base, drop-outs in online universities have historically been a high single-digit
percentage[6] (between 6% and 7% churn on average in the past 5 academic years) of the total enrolled student
base at the beginning of the year, a figure which is expected to stabilize around 6% going forward (the level
reached in academic year 2019/2020). Multiversity today already has a churn below the one expected for the
market, standing at a remarkable approximately 5%, which is evidence of the quality of the business offering and
student base.

_Postgraduate master’s_

Postgraduate education includes 2nd level master’s (either 1-year or 2-year long) for students who have
completed an undergraduate degree (either an undergraduate master’s degree (“specialistica”) or a 5-year degree
(“Ciclo unico” or “magistrale”, for law students). The Italian population enrolled in the postgraduate master’s
segment, currently representing 5%[54] of the total higher education market, has displayed a stronger historical
growth than the undergraduate market, increasing from 52,000 students in academic year 2015/2016 to 96,000 in
academic year 2019/2020, representing a 17% annual growth rate. Online universities experienced a remarkable
39% annual growth rate in their student population, over six times faster than traditional universities (whose
annual growth rate stood at 6%). The total number of students in the postgraduate master’s market is expected to
continue to grow at double digit annual growth rate, more than doubling from current levels, reaching 195,000
students by academic year 2025/2026.

Online universities currently attract more students than traditional ones; online penetration in the academic year
2019/2020 stood at 57% of the total population (vs. approximately 36% in academic year 2015/2016). This
penetration of online universities is expected to further grow, reaching 66% in academic year 2025/2026. By
then, 128,000 master’s students are expected to be enrolled in online universities, a pool of students larger than
the current total for the postgraduate master’s market.

Multiversity is set to benefit from this postgraduate master’s market growth. Focusing on that segment in
particular has seen strong growth and this trend is expected to continue. Quality of the education offering and
flexibility of the business model (especially for workers) are the main reasons for choosing Multiversity’s
master’s programs. In addition, Multiversity, through its two universities, is able to offer contents which are
aligned with the Italian job market’s needs.

_Postgraduate courses_

Multiversity also derives a high percentage of its postgraduate revenues from single courses (FIT + FORM +
Single Courses) which are highly connected with public administration hiring trends through “Concorso
Pubblico” (i.e. public hiring tenders that require a specific exam). These hiring trends were severely affected by
the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing public tenders by 60/70%[56] compared to previous years, but a rebound is
expected as these tend to be recurring hiring tenders over the years. Until 2025, Unioncamere expects the need to
hire 740,000 new employees in the public administration either to replace workers who are retiring (93% of total)
or for new positions (7% of total). Hires are expected to remain below historical averages for 2021
(approximately 30-50 thousand new employees) given the pandemic, but a significant bounce back is expected
from 2022, with Multiversity set to positively benefit from this due to its market position.

Total employment in the public administration has overall been flat in the last five years (approximately 3.2m
employees), with yearly hires showing, historically, a fluctuating trend, with an average inflow of approximately
70,000 units per annum (excluding healthcare hires, mainly out of Pegaso FORM, FIT and Single Courses
offering). In the medium term, the number of hires from the public administration is estimated to bounce back
from 2022 (highest inflow, at approximately 90,000—110,000) until 2025 (approximately 65,000—85,000)
driven by:

(i) approximately 70,000 baseline hires to re-align to historical trends for total public administration
employees, with a larger impact in the initial years as the market “recovers from the lost ground”
(approximately 60,000—90.000 less employments) created by “Concorsi Pubblici” postponements in
2020-21; and

(ii) a substantial boost to the economy and, subsequently, hiring levels through the Recovery Fund.

Multiversity, deriving the majority of its postgraduate revenues from these single courses, is perfectly positioned
to benefit from the re-acceleration of “Concorsi Pubblici” from 2022 onwards.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

**_General_**

Multiversity is the market leader in Italy in the e-learning market by number of enrolled students with a 40%
market share of the Italian online undergraduate higher education market for the 2019/2020 academic year
capturing approximately 3% of the total Italian undergraduate market.[58] It operates two private online
universities, Pegaso and Mercatorum, a certification entity, Certipass and a number of academies as well as an
international lifelong learning higher education institution based in Malta. It delivers its services through a
proprietary online platform that carries out the e-learning contents produced in-house.

Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A., held by Multiversity, is the promoter and supporter of Pegaso,
Multiversity’s primary education institution. Approximately 105,000 students were enrolled in one of Pegaso’s
online courses for the 2020-2021 academic year. Pegaso offers a range of both undergraduate and postgraduate
courses, and in particular, seven undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single
cycle five-year degree and 139 postgraduate master’s courses as well as a number of higher education and
specialization courses for professionals and high school graduates. Pegaso also offers six individual certifications
and gives students the possibility to undertake single examinations for each course module upon payment of a fee
without having to complete the full course.

Multiversity’s other key institution, Mercatorum, is held indirectly by Multiversity through its 66.66% stake in
the share capital of Unimercatorum S.r.l. as the promoter and supporter of Mercatorum, with the remaining
33.33% stake in Unimercatorum S.r.l. is held indirectly by Unioncamere. Unioncamere, the Italian Union of
Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and Agriculture, is the public body that unites and institutionally
represents the Italian system of chambers of commerce. Approximately 23,000 students were enrolled in
Mercatorum for the 2020-2021 academic year. Mercatorum’s core offering currently consists of 14
undergraduate bachelor’s degrees (two of which are newly accredited and are therefore being offered for the first
time in the 2021/2022 academic year), four specialist master’s degrees, one Ph.D. and 11 postgraduate master’s
courses. Like Pegaso, it also allows students to undertake single examinations for any course module offered
within its curricula.

Other assets of Multiversity include Certipass, as provider of international certifications for digital competences
and IT skills, and an ever-growing number of academies established through collaboration agreements between
Pegaso and Mercatorum and their respective commercial partners, covering a wide range of specialist subjects
such as marketing, communications and media and teaching. In addition, Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l. (“Principe
**di Napoli”) was established in February 2019 by Pegaso in partnership with Mercatorum (holding 90% and 10%**
stakes, respectively) as a center for higher education and specialization in the sectors of gastronomy and tourism.
Apart from the Postgraduate School in Legal Professions (as further described below), Principe di Napoli is one
of the few institution within Multiversity to hold on premise courses.

Multiversity also operates a publishing entity and companies dedicated to research, which are mostly ancillary
and in support of the two universities. Almost the entirety of its operations are located in Italy, with some limited
operations in Malta. It also has collaboration agreements with several partners in Italy for the development and
delivery of specialized courses in a multitude of subjects, made available through its two universities.

Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €188.7 million, as
compared to €138.8 million[59] for the prior financial year (an increase of 36%), while Multiversity’s revenues for
the six months ended June 30, 2021 were €133.8 million, as compared to €98.1 million in the same period of the
prior financial year (an increase of 36%). Undergraduate enrolled students increased by approximately 50% in
the 2020/2021 academic year with respect to the previous academic year. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA
generated for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €102.3 million as compared to €74.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 (an increase of 37%), while Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021
was equal to €84.7 million, as compared to €57.4 million in the same period of the prior financial year.

Approximately 98% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated by Pegaso
(which accounted for 89% of Multiversity’s revenues) and Mercatorum (which accounted for 9% of

In order to support their online offering, Multiversity’s institutions have an extensive network of approximately
3,000[60] e-learning center points as at September 30, 2021 across each of Pegaso (the “ELCP Points”),
Mercatorum (the “Ei-Points”) and Certipass (the “EIPASS Points” and, together with ELCP Points and
Ei-Points, the “ELCPs”). The ELCPs provide information to prospective and current students about the various
institutions, and in particular, Pegaso and Mercatorum’s ELCP Points and the Ei-Points, among other things,
serve as orientation centers for new students throughout the entire duration of the course they undertake. The
ELCP Points and the Ei-Points performed orientation activities for approximately 60% of Multiversity’s
institution’s new students, however the relevant institution retains the direct relationship with student as it
manages the enrollment process and tuition fee payments directly with the student[61]. As regards Certipass’
EIPASS Points, these purchase EIPASS cards from Certipass and on-sell them to customers who wish to obtain
an EIPASS certification. All ELCPs are managed by external third parties that have entered into specific
accreditation agreements with Pegaso, Mercatorum or Certipass (in some cases, more than one institution has
entered into an accreditation agreement with the same ELCP). See “Material Contracts—Accreditation
_Agreements for ELCPs” below._

**_Business Model_**

Multiversity’s business model is based on a student-centric offering of a flexible learning experience and access
to teaching content through our proprietary and technologically advanced e-learning platform. Both Pegaso and
Mercatorum address a specific unmet demand in the market for a flexible path to an undergraduate degree, whilst
catering to specific professions for postgraduate continuous learning.

Revenues are mainly driven by tuition fees paid by students to Pegaso and Mercatorum, which contributed to
77%[62] of Multiversity’s revenues. The levels of tuition fees in turn depend on the number of students, the nature
or class of degree undertaken, the year of enrollment, the type of course and the student’s selected enrollment
channel, amongst other factors. Undergraduate degrees, which are multi-year courses (three year bachelor’s
degree plus a two year specialist master’s degree, or a single-cycle five year degree), are a recurring multi-year
revenue stream for the term of the program (consisting of both the tuition fees and any other ancillary fees),
which has an average course length of 2.8 years. Approximately 40% of graduates from Pegaso and Mercatorum
who have completed three year undergraduate degree courses wish to continue their education and apply to enroll
in two year specialist master’s degree and master’s degree courses with the same institution. Undergraduate
tuition fees accounted for 54% of Pegaso’s revenues and 80% of Mercatorum’s revenues in the financial year
ended December 31, 2020, and 62% of Pegaso’s revenues and 85% of Mercatorum’s revenues for the six months
ended June 30, 2021.

On the other hand, one-year postgraduate master’s courses (i.e. second level master’s which may be undertaken
by students who have already completed a three year undergraduate bachelor’s degree plus a two year specialist
master’s degree or a single-cycle five year degree) together with Multiversity’s FIT offering (i.e. teacher training
courses) provide a one-off tuition fee payment per student, accounting for 20% of Pegaso’s revenues and 4% of
Mercatorum’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 and 12% of Pegaso’s revenues and 6%
of Mercatorum’s revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Various other services offered to students
provide additional revenue such as fees payable in order to take examinations in an alternative location, and
certificates—such additional services accounted for approximately 20% of Pegaso’s revenues and 8% of
Mercatorum’s revenues, in each case for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 and 26% of Pegaso’s
revenues and 11% of Mercatorum’s revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Single exams contributed
to 4% of Pegaso’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with 3%. for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 (whereas single exams generally contribute less than 1% towards Mercatorum’s revenues).

Multiversity’s growth strategy is based on expanding volumes by increasing market penetration within the
population, whilst selectively increasing its course offering, its brand awareness, digital marketing practices and
_ad hoc orientation services to prospective students as well as by entering into commercial agreements and_
partnerships falling into two main categories:

- agreements with corporations, law enforcement, governmental bodies and public administration authorities
providing for the application of lower corporate rates to their employees (and, in certain instances, their
family members) and, in some cases, for the creation and implementation of employee training programs,
thereby incentivizing such employees to attend courses in order to accelerate their career paths or to comply
with the ongoing professional development requirements set up by regulators or employers; and

- partnerships with private companies and public entities aimed at the development of specialized courses
using the partners’ know-how and branding, coupled with Multiversity’s online e-learning platform,
teaching know-how and, in certain instances, its academic staff. These agreements give rise, for example, to
the specialist academies forming part of Pegaso and Mercatorum’s higher education offering, as further
described below.

Multiversity has established a nation-wide presence, with Pegaso’s approximately 100 exam venues located in
prestigious or historical buildings, Mercatorum’s leveraging of the system of the Italian chambers of commerce
and the institutions’ network of approximately 3,000 ELCPs, along with a strong online social community and
proprietary technology platforms for online classes, exams and tutoring.

The main objective underpinning Multiversity’s business strategy is to consolidate its market position and
become the leading entirely online education group in the Italian markets, employing both Business-to-Consumer
and Business-to-Business marketing strategies in order to target an ever-wider audience of students. See further

**_History_**

The Italian inter-Ministerial Decree (issued jointly by the MIUR and the Italian Ministry of Technological
Innovation) of April 17, 2003 paved the way for the establishment of private online universities in Italy. The
decree was aimed at increasing the percentage of Italians holding a bachelor’s degree (at the time, amongst the
lowest in Europe). Pegaso was founded in 2006 as a non-commercial entity, having been licensed by the
Ministerial Decree of April 20, 2006 of the MIUR, and launched its first two degree programs, one being a three
year bachelor’s degree and the other a single-cycle five year degree.

By 2015, Pegaso had over 65 examination centers in Italy. Pegaso further expanded its offering by the acquisition
of the majority stake in Mercatorum as it was complementary to its existing business and founded Pegaso
International Ltd. based in Malta. By 2019, Multiversity’s institutions had over 100,000 enrolled students.

In 2019, CVC acquired 50% of the share capital of Multiversity from the founder, Danilo Iervolino, and Pegaso
transformed into a private corporation in the form of a limited liability company (see “Regulation—Transformation
_of Pegaso into a private corporation”). The Principe di Napoli campus was also launched in the same year._

In 2020, Multiversity continued to expand its international business by opening an orientation center based in
Turkey.

In the 2020/2021 academic year, Multiversity had approximately 130,000 enrolled students and launched its new
student e-learning platform in order to accommodate its enrolled students across its educational institutions
offering new interactive and effective functionalities based on its experience in education and artificial
intelligence technology spanning over ten years.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Education and training is a large, resilient, underpenetrated market with strong fundamentals, particularly in_**
**_online segment_**

Global education and training is a large market, currently valued at over $5.0 trillion[63], and it is expected to grow
steadily across the whole spectrum, given significant white space and the need for re-skilling of a significant
portion of global population, mainly due to the digital evolution and the new competencies required (“Lifelong
Learning”).

Online education still represents a relatively small portion overall of the larger global education market, with an
estimated global online penetration of 3.6%[64] in 2020. However, the online education segment has and is
expected to continue to show strong growth, having outpaced traditional physical education growth in recent
years whilst progressively gaining market share and unlocking unaddressed areas of demand. This growth is
expected to continue, and in particular subcategories such as higher education, supplemental business–toconsumer (“B2C”) and corporate training are expected to accelerate on the back of COVID-19, which has
hastened the adoption of online learning and resulted in an acceleration of online academic offerings.

The global education market as a whole has historically grown at a slow but steady pace and has proven
resilient[65] through economic cycles, including the financial crisis. Future growth in this market is expected to be
supported by several strong structural trends, including: (i) continued student population growth globally and
economic expansion; (ii) a growing professional class willing to supplement formal education; (iii) rising levels
of participation in education; (iv) the need for employee re-skilling and (v) global investments to further advance
education and digitalization.

Undergraduate enrollment in Italy has proven resilient over time, displaying a counter cyclical correlation with
economic cycles and historically experiencing an increase in enrollments during economic downturns.[66]

Online universities have been the main contributor to the growth in undergraduate enrollment since they began
operating in the Italian market in 2006. More recently, the number of Italian first-timers (new university students
who have never been enrolled in university programs) and total students enrolled both maintained their growth[67],
in spite of the adverse impact to Italian GDP as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Italy, the overall undergraduate market—encompassing both traditional and online programs—grew steadily
at a 1% CAGR[68] over the past four years, reaching a total of 1.8 million students in the 2019-2020 academic
year, with enrolment expected to surpass the 2.0 million mark by the 2025-2026 academic year. The primary
beneficiary and driver of this growth in the undergraduate population was the online segment, which showcased a
20% annual growth rate between the 2015/2016 and 2019/2020 academic years, while the number of students
enrolled in traditional universities has remained substantially flat over the same period. Similar trends are
expected to continue, with the online segment anticipated to grow at an annual growth rate of 19% from the
2019/2020 through the 2025/2026 academic years, driving overall market growth even as enrolment at traditional
universities is expected to remain flat.

A lower percentage of degree holders and a gap in digital skills versus other industrialized peers means that Italy
has the potential to benefit disproportionately from these trends as it seeks to close the gap—both in terms of
education and digitalization—versus its European peers. Italy stands at 27.7%[69] (vs. 44.9% for OECD) in terms
of average population holding a degree and ranks fourth to last versus other developed countries in the DESI
digitalization index[70]. The higher education and skills gaps vis-à-vis populations in peer nations represent a
significant growth opportunity for online education in Italy, and in particular those programs specializing in
digital skills training.

Due to its aging workforce, Italy is also expected to require a large number of graduates across multiple
disciplines in the next five years, totalling nearly 900,000 in expected new hires according to Unioncamere[71].
Specifically with respect to the disciplines in which Multiversity focuses, the expected need over this period is
for approximately 120,000 graduates in Economics & Business Administration, 120,000 in Engineering, 105,000
in Teaching and Training and 90,000 in Law.

_Demand for graduates in the Italian job market_

The postgraduate market has grown even faster than the undergraduate market, experiencing a CAGR of 17%
from the 2015/2016 to the 2019/2020 academic years and reaching 96,000 students in the 2019/2020 academic
year. Over the same period, growth in online postgraduate enrollment, which already exceeds that of traditional
channels, was a CAGR of 30%. Postgraduate growth is expected to continue at a double-digit CAGR through the
2025/2026 academic year, driven primarily by the continued increase in the adoption of online education.

In addition to these secular long-term trends, growth in the online undergraduate and postgraduate education
markets, which comprise the Multiversity Group’s core addressable markets, has been buoyed by recent shortterm catalysts, including the COVID-19 pandemic which accelerated adoption of online channels, as well as
improving sentiment regarding online universities among prospective students. COVID-19 has boosted overall
internet penetration to levels significantly exceeding pre-crisis (e-commerce, e-health, e-learning), also including
the demand for online education. This has resulted in a pronounced short-term spike in expected growth which,
over the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 academic years, is expected to be more than double the annualized growth
rate expected from 2022/2023 to 2025/2026 (projected 28% over 2020/2021-2021/2022 academic years as
compared to 14% over 2022/2023-2025/2026 academic years, annual growth rates for the Italian online
undergraduate enrolled base). Students’ improving perception of online universities has been a key factor in
recent growth, as illustrated by the 83% of students[72] currently enrolled in online universities who think that the
quality of teaching they receive is on par, if not better, than that of traditional universities. This favorable
impression is also validated by employability statistics that put online universities slightly above mid-sized
physical universities among top employers selecting applicants[73] (over a period of 12 months, 8.6% of students
from online universities went to one of the top 50 employers in Italy, vs. 8.5% for mid-sized universities).

A rising proportion of Italian high school students is expected to be interested in attending an online university,
on the back of increasing perceived strength of their online education offerings. The proportion of first-timers
(new university students coming from high school who have never enrolled in university) is expected to increase
to 47% of new students in the 2025/2026[74] academic year as compared to 39% today in 2019/2020 and 33% in
2015/2016. Students are attracted to a model that they feel better suits their needs thanks to inherent flexibility,
more friendly study experience and better support, alongside lower costs (especially when considering costs
ancillary to education such as accommodation and travel).

_Structural tailwinds_

The education market has demonstrated steady and resilient growth on the back of various structural tailwinds:

- **Historical population growth and economic expansion: increasing population globally and economic**
growth will naturally expand the addressable market with an increasing number of people willing to get a
formal education;

- **Emerging middle class willing to supplement formal education: the middle class in particular sees**
education as an enabler of personal growth and wealth, thus making it likely to supplement formal, basic
education with additional courses;

- **Rising levels of participation in education: overall participation in education is rising, reflecting a need**
for skilled workforce globally due to trends in industrialization and modernization that have automated
many of the processes that previously employed unskilled workers;

- **“Lifelong learning”: even a skilled and educated labor force is likely to require additional skills training**
due to the speed of digital evolution and the implied new competencies required. Recently, due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, these programs have largely been restricted to online channels;

- **Government investments to increase levels of education: recognizing higher education as an indicator of**
citizens’ wealth, governments globally are investing in increased access to education in an effort to meet the
Sustainable Development Goals (“SDG”) 2030 Agenda: (i) ensuring inclusive and equitable quality
education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all and (ii) promoting continuous, inclusive and
sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.

Online education also benefits from the specific tailwinds inherent to a delivery model that provides access to
people that could not otherwise participate full time or afford to attend a traditional, physical university. Onlinespecific tailwinds in education include:

- **Increasing online penetration reaching new potential students: online education unlocks an addressable**
market by reaching previously underrepresented parts of the population, either due to economic or logistical
reasons;

- **Government investments in digitalization: focus on digitalization efforts with dedicated funds (i.e.**
€49.2 billion for Italy alone in the latest European Recovery Fund focused on digitalization of public
administration and of the industrial sector[75]);

- **Younger generations’ desire for higher education: new generations value both quality education and**
flexible career paths, which online universities offer, thanks a better-suited consumption model, especially
for part-time students;

- **Lower overall costs: not requiring costs for attending physical lessons (e.g. housing, transport, cost of**
living), online education is generally more affordable than traditional one and accordingly appeals to a
growing share of the population that desires an education but could not otherwise afford to attend a
traditional university;

- **Tapping unmet demand: online education offers to people who historically have not been able to obtain a**
university degree, or are currently working, programs addressing their demand for a more flexible path to a
degree;

- **Highly Scalable Supply: constrained by the practical limits of in-person education, traditional universities**
will struggle to meet increasing demand for graduates globally, while online universities’ business model is
highly scalable and can increase capacity as needed, leveraging existing platform without additional
required large investments in infrastructures.

_Current sentiment for online universities_

A market study conducted by a third-party commercial advisor (the “Third Party Commercial Advisor”)[76]
highlighted an overall very positive market sentiment towards online universities, which it found were
considered highly comparable to traditional ones from a teaching perspective. Of the respondents currently

enrolled in online universities, 83% consider teaching from online universities to be on par with, if not better,
than traditional universities, and this view is shared by 62% of respondents interested in online universities.[77]

A key differentiating point for enrollment in online universities is the perceived increased flexibility and time
saving according to 56% of enrolled students, with a faster academic path, higher university support and lower
overall cost being other key factors. The study also illustrates how the online education platform offered by
online universities is perceived of higher quality due to its “native” nature vs. online/ hybrid education models
offered by traditional channels.

Employability of online university graduates is on average in line with the levels registered in mid-size or largesize traditional universities: among graduates who switched jobs in the 12 months between January 2020 and
January 2021, 8.6% were hired full time by the top 50 Italian employers[78] from online universities, compared to
8.5% for graduates from mid-sized traditional universities and 9.5% for graduates from large-sized traditional
universities in the same time frame.

Multiversity enjoys a strong leadership position in the Italian online university market due to its combination of
strong operational expertise, a solid and difficult to replicate business model and a comprehensive and
complementary academic offering catering to the different needs of a large pool of students delivered through a
superior technological platform.

Pegaso, the largest and most widely known of Multiversity’s online universities, has the broadest academic reach
(with seven undergraduate degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single-cycle five-year degree and over
250 higher education / specialization and postgraduate master’s courses), offering courses across a variety of
disciplines including law, engineering, economics and literature, among others. Mercatorum, while smaller than
Pegaso, is best placed to capture emerging educational trends in fields such as design, food, big data and
sustainable mobility on the back of its strong ties to the territory and business communities, leveraging the
partnership with the Italian Chamber of Commerce (owner of a 33% stake in Mercatorum) and a highly tailored
offering (14 undergraduate degrees, four specialist master’s degrees and one PhD programme[79]). Finally, other
assets, such as Certipass (international certifications for digital competencies and IT skills), Principe di Napoli
and the academies, complement the breadth of the Multiversity portfolio and support the increasing
diversification of the business with no overlapping of educational contents between the two online universities.

The effectiveness of Multiversity’s business model also resides in its distribution platform, which allows it to
retain full and direct contact with students over the course of their enrollment through the control of distribution
and quality of education content. Students can be oriented directly by the universities or by the E-learning Center
Points (“ELCPs”). The ELCPs network of approximately 3.000[80] local affiliates guarantees Multiversity a
capillary presence all over the country, offering (in the case of Pegaso and Mercatorum) information and
orientation assistance and (in the case of Certipass) EIPASS Certifications and related services to new potential
students with a variety of different academic profiles, interests and backgrounds. This local presence throughout
Italy allows flexibility of strategy to adapt to future market changes as well as proximity to students. All ELCPs
are managed by external third parties that have entered into accreditation agreements with Multiversity’s
institutions. See “Business—Material Contracts—Accreditation Agreements for ELCPs.”

_A) Undergraduate market_

Multiversity enjoys a strong leadership position in the online undergraduate market, with a market share of circa
40%[81] as of academic year 2019/2020, more than two times bigger than the number two player in the online
undergraduate education universe. Leveraging on its ability to address a broad market with a unique quality offer,
year over year Multiversity has consistently gained market share in the undergraduate education segment,
becoming leader in the academic year 2017/2018 and, since then, consolidating its prominent position.
Multiversity’s share of this market has grown by 19.2% over the past four years, and has captured an estimated
over 55% of total market growth from academic year 2015/2016 to academic year 2019/2020.

The online undergraduate market is concentrated around the top five players, which represented ~90% of the
combined student population in academic year 2019/2020 and captured the majority of recent growth.

The landscape of key online universities active in the Italian undergraduate market includes:

 - **Multiversity, through its two universities Pegaso and Mercatorum, has a leading market share in the online**
Italian market, with a combined market share of approximately 40% in the academic year 2019/2020
(Pegaso: 34.7%, Mercatorum: 5.2%). Multiversity Group’s market share has increased since academic year
2015/2016 by 14.4% for Pegaso and 4.8% for Mercatorum. Pegaso has by far the most extensive capillary
network in the market and charges average annual tuition fees of €1,800[82];

 - **Università Niccolò Cusano (“Cusano”) is the second-largest player, with a market share of 18.6% in**
academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 10.1% since academic year 2015/2016.
Cusano charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €3,000[82];

 - **E-Campus Università (“e-Campus”) is the third-largest market player with a market share of 15.0% in**
academic year 2019/2020, representing a market share gain of 2.8% since academic year 2015/2016.
E-Campus charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €3,200[82];

 - **Università Telematica Internazionale Uninettuno (“Uninettuno”) is the fourth-largest market player**
with a market share of 11.2% in academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 4.1%
since academic year 2015/2016. Uninettuno charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €1,600.

 - **Guglielmo Marconi (“Marconi”) is the fifth-largest market player with a market share of 7.5% in**
academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 7.5% since academic year 2015/2016.
Marconi charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €1,760[82].

_B) Postgraduate master’s market_

The postgraduate master’s market accounts for approximately 5% of the total higher education market, as
opposed to 95% for the undergraduate market (95.0% in academic year 2019/2020). The online postgraduate
market is concentrated but is similarly concentrated around five top players collectively representing almost 90%
of the combined student population in academic year 2019/2020 and who have gained 21.6% in market share
from all other competitors in the past 4 years. Furthermore, the top two players, Multiversity and e-Campus,
together account for around 76% of the market, with e-Campus gaining the leading position over the last three
years.

The landscape of key online universities active in the postgraduate master’s market includes:

 - **e-Campus is the market leader, with a market share of 45.1% in academic year 2019/2020, a significant**
increase over the past three years considering that in academic year 2016/2017 it only had a market share of
2.3%;

 - **Multiversity is the second-largest player with a combined market share of approximately 31% in academic**
year 2019/2020 (Pegaso 29.4%, Mercatorum 1.6%). While doubling its enrolment in absolute terms over the
past four years, Pegaso, like all other key players aside from Mercatorum, experienced a decline in market
share since academic year 2015/2016 due to the strong growth of e-Campus (Multiversity Group’s
combined market share declined by 13.2% over this period). Multiversity benefits from a unique partnership
with the public sector thanks to the direct participation of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, which holds a
circa 33% stake in Mercatorum;

 - **Cusano is the third-largest player with 9.8% market share in academic year 2019/2020, having conceded**
6.2% in market share since academic year 2015/2016;

 - **Uninettuno is the fourth-largest player with a market share of 2.3% in the academic year 2019/2020, but**
has almost halved its market share since academic year 2015/2016.

 - **Guglielmo Marconi is the fifth-largest player with a market share of 1.2% in the academic year 2019/2020,**
but has lost 0.6% in market share since academic year 2015/2016.

The Italian university market, initially closed to online universities, was officially opened to online competition
in 2003 with a ministry decree in an effort to improve the percentage of Italian population with a higher
education degree (one of the lowest of Europe). Since the opening of the online Italian higher education market
in 2003, 11 private online universities were established, with online universities enrolling their first students in
2006. There are no public online universities and the online university market is structurally closed to new
entrants, as no further licenses are currently expected to be issued. In particular, the restriction for the
establishment of online universities in Italy is usually extended every 3 years, with the publication of the
Ministerial Decree governing Italian universities’ academic planning. The latest Ministerial Decree published in
March 2021 (Decree n. 289 of 25 March 2021) confirmed the restriction until the academic year 2023/2024.

As a result of the restriction on the establishment of new online universities, barriers to entry are particularly high
for any potential new entrant, whether domestic or from abroad. Even if the restriction were to be lifted,
prospective market entrants would face significant upfront investments, in terms of time and resources, to catch
up with established online players, like Multiversity, that has already established a nation-wide presence,
superior technological platform, well-recognized brand and significant scale.

Traditional universities have historically limited their focus and investments in online education platforms as a
result of various factors:

 - **Structural complexity of a hybrid education model: arising from the coexistence of traditional and online**
learning for the courses being offered and organizational complexity and teaching methodology change not
easy to replicate. There might also be resistance to change from academics, which tend to favour traditional
university teaching compared to online methods;

 - **Infrastructural gaps and investments required: given the geographic concentration of university facilities**
(generally in a single city, sometimes even a single campus/building) they lack the nationwide exam venues/
network reach of online universities. Furthermore, the need for IT investments to adapt the business models
is significant, both in terms of economic resources, as well as time and technical capabilities. Decisions over
these matters typically take longer times in traditional universities, in particular for public-owned
universities, given strategic agendas which do not prioritize online education and budget constraints;

 - **Perceived risks around potential brand dilution: for some of the most prominent names in the traditional**
education space, given the different offer and target markets.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional universities were forced by the circumstances to offer online
classes, but this is seen as only a temporary solution, with some already returning to forms of traditional
education in the academic year 2021/2022. Most importantly, traditional universities cannot offer a permanent
online solution without Ministry approval.

**_Compelling customer proposition, with capillary presence across the country and iconic venues_**

Online universities offer a value proposition capable of meeting the needs of a growing population seeking
higher education but dissatisfied with a traditional university learning experience and service delivery. The key
elements characterizing online universities’ value proposition are: (i) a “student-centric” learning experience;
(ii) convenience; (iii) equivalent legal value of degree (in most cases at a lower cost); (iv) extensive physical
network and iconic venues in city centers; (v) effective commercial strategy and (vi) credibility and
employability with employers.

Flexibility and convenience are the most important differentiating factors for students, chosen by 56% of
respondents as the main reason for preferring online versus traditional universities based on a survey of 800
current students of online universities. Another key reason, growing in importance, is the lower overall cost, as
distance learning removes a prominent barrier for many prospective students: the need to move to a different
location to attend university (thereby saving travel and accommodation costs).

These attributes have allowed online universities, like Multiversity, to unlock a market otherwise inaccessible via
traditional channels, catering to students that require flexibility (such as, for example, full-time workers) or that
considered university inaccessible due to costs (such as travel and accommodation costs).

The superior quality of Multiversity’s business model is evidenced by Pegaso’s “Net Promoter Score,” a grade
delivered by actual students for the quality of its online deliver. Pegaso’s NPS is the highest in the market, with

46%[83] of respondents happy to recommend Pegaso to a friend. This NPS favorably compares to 25% for the
number two player, and an overall average of 15% for all other online universities.

Student Centric Learning Experience

A key element distinguishing online universities from traditional universities is the high degree of flexibility. Not
only can students follow courses online from anywhere; they can also choose to attend their exams in multiple
venues across Italy, in up to 12 different exam sessions per year. Traditional universities, on the other hand, only
offer exams in one primary location, in up to 4 exam sessions per year.

Online universities also offer a more student-friendly study experience. Lessons can be followed from anywhere
via the online platform, with video-recorded classes lasting c. 25-30 minutes each, available 24/7 to students.
Study packs are provided for each lesson, as well as numerous online mock exams. The offering is
complemented by flexible additional services, such as dedicated tutors, online chat client and specific forums for
both students and professors. Traditional universities, by contrast, generally only offer lessons on campus, with
fixed schedules lasting 1-2 hours, and classes are usually not recorded. Specific textbooks are required, while the
supporting materials and mock exams are often limited. Office hours are fixed and must be booked in advance,
making communication between students and professors more difficult.

Beyond encompassing all of the key advantages common to online universities, Multiversity’s offering in
particular overperforms competitors thanks to its unique physical presence across Italy, including approximately
100 iconic exam locations, and a superior proprietary technological platform and contents.

More convenient alternative

Online education platforms offer students significantly decreased all-in costs of education versus traditional
universities. Tuition fees are aligned to those of competing public traditional universities, however since courses
can be attended remotely there is no need for students to acquire or rent accommodation to be close to the
university (that is often one of the most sizeable and prohibitive implicit costs of university attendance) or pay
for transit. Moreover, students can realize significant savings on course materials, given that all study materials
are made available online and are included in the tuition fee. In traditional universities, by contrast, the primary
source of information used in courses is physical textbooks, which students often need to purchase at significant
cost.

Multiversity’s pricing is highly competitive, both among other online universities and, to an even higher extent,
when compared to traditional universities. Pegaso, for example, offers an average undergraduate preferential
tuition fee per year of circa €1,800, compared to circa €3,000 per year for Cusano and e-Campus.

Officially recognized degree and equivalent legal value university degree

The degrees are accredited, have the same legal value and are verified in the same way as public and private
universities degrees in Italy by the MIUR.

The Italian national agency for the evaluation of university and research systems (Agenzia Nazionale di
_Valutazione del Sistema Universitario e della Ricerca or “ANVUR”) periodically inspects online and traditional_
universities to evaluate their services and provide them with an official accreditation. Pegaso and Mercatorum
received top marks among online competitors in their latest accreditation visits in 2017.

Multiversity’s wide and robust quality offering is continuously innovated through new courses (such as Big Data
approved for Mercatorum) to adapt to changing trends and needs. Multiversity’s reputation and brand awareness
has benefited from the experience and breadth of its academic staff, which includes 76 full and associate
professors (university professor holding a chair hired indefinitely), 155 extraordinary professors (experts on the
specific research development sector), 479 contract professors (discipline expert with renewable annual
assignment), 16 researchers (scholar of specific research fields) and 88 tutors developing cutting-edge proprietary
content. Among its speakers and guests, Multiversity has hosted a breadth of personalities including former
ministers, general secretary of the largest Italian labor union and award-winning film directors and screenwriters.

Capillary Physical Network and Iconic Venues

Proximity and ease of access to local infrastructure are key determinants for students when choosing between
traditional forms of higher education and online and, within the latter, selecting one university over another.

Multiversity enjoys a unique presence in Italy thanks to Pegaso’s approximately 100 iconic exam locations in the
most important Italian cities and a difficult to replicate network of approximately 820 Pegaso and 800
Mercatorum ELCPs located throughout the country.

The numerous locations across Italy allow students to sit for exams close to their home cities. The use of iconic
buildings as exam centers is also a contributor to establishing strong brand recognition with a unique positioning
and brand awareness, not only among the students’ population, but also among all the members of academic
staff.

The large E-learning Center network of affiliates guarantees Multiversity a capillary presence across the country,
offering orientation services and information to new potential students with a variety of different academic
profiles, interests and backgrounds. This local presence throughout Italy allows flexibility of strategy to adapt to
future market changes and proximity to students.

Effective commercial approach across traditional and online channels

Unlike their traditional counterparts, online universities generally display a more committed approach towards
marketing and advertising, engaging with potential and existing students both online and via traditional channels
such as billboards, television and radio. Multiversity has developed a particularly strong position across the
spectrum, thanks to a well-developed multi-channel marketing strategy coupled with its capillary nationwide
network.

Pegaso shows a higher social media following than most of online and traditional competitors, on the back of
strong student engagement. This level of interaction was aided in part by targeted advertising with exclusive
partners, such as a co-branding campaign with the movie Spider-man: Homecoming in 2017, and by airing TV
spots during peak times, for example during widely-followed shows in Italy.

The effectiveness of Multiversity online marketing strategy is particularly relevant when considering the
increasing penetration of first time students in the Italian online higher education channel, with such category—
by nature, given the younger age - being more receptive and used to online forms of advertising vs. traditional
ones.

Additionally, Pegaso and Mercatorum have established and consistently grown their unique network via
framework agreements with more than 1,500 associations including public bodies, trade unions, the Chamber of
Commerce, municipalities, cultural associations, private companies and sports associations. This network is over
six times larger than any of the key competitors’ and continues to grow, with approximately 350 new agreements
concluded by Pegaso in the last year alone, 1.6 times the number of total agreements that the second player in the
market had in 2020. These framework agreements are fundamental to Multiversity’s business model, as they
increase the possibility to secure a captive customer base.

Credible and Valid Access to Top Quality Employers

Multiversity’s strong link with the Italian Chamber of Commerce (through its stake in Mercatorum) allow
Multiversity’s students to be best positioned to meet Italy’s future employment needs. Multiversity’s offering is
tailored to respond to the future demands of the Italian job market. The latest estimates by Unioncamere relating
to employment needs between 2020 and 2024 predict that almost 900,000 graduates will find a job between 2020
and 2024. Specifically, in the fields in which Multiversity offers degree and other programs, the expected need
will be circa 120,000 graduates in Economics & Business Administration, circa 120,000 in Engineering, circa
105,000 in Teaching and Training and circa 90,000 in Law, collectively accounting for approximately 50% of the
total projected demand.

_Demand for graduates in the Italian job market and Multiversity offer[85]_

Multiversity single courses, including FIT (courses related to anthropo-phsycho-pedagological disciplines for
students striving to become 2nd grade teachers), FORM, and Single Courses, are aligned with Public
Administration hiring trends through “Concorso Pubblico” (i.e. public hiring tenders that require a specific
exam). These hiring trends were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing public tenders by
60-70%[86] compared to previous years, but a rebound is expected as these tend to be recurring hiring tenders over
the years. Through 2025, Unioncamere expects the need to hire 740,000 new employees into public
administration, either to replace workers who are retiring (93%) or for new positions (7%).

**_When assessing post-degree job opportunities, Multiversity benefits from both online sector and company-_**
**_specific trends._**

An analysis by a Third Party Commercial Advisor among the top 50 Italian employers shows similar
employability rates among online and traditional university graduates. Specifically, the percentage of online
university graduates that switched jobs over the last 12 months and were hired full-time by one of the top 50
Italian employers was on average 8.6%[87] as of June 2021. This is 0.1% higher than graduates of mid-sized
universities and only 0.9% lower than large universities. The comparable employment rate among online
university graduates supports the credibility and validity of online education as an alternative higher education
offer, which is expected to increase its overall appeal and spur demand across different segments of online
universities’ overall addressable market.

Compared to other online universities, Pegaso had the largest overall market share among online universities,
equal to 33% of graduates hired in the past 12 months by the top 50 employers in Italy. According to a survey of
1,000 respondents[88], Pegaso’s graduates find jobs in: (i) Public Administration (20% of total alumni); (ii) top 50
Italian employers and large companies (16%); iii) as independent professionals (17%) and (iv) small/medium
enterprises (47%). In addition, Multiversity is the market leader in terms of its graduates being hired in the
energy and utilities, financial services and industrial sectors[89].

**_Proprietary technological platform and content with superior user experience_**

development of this cutting-edge IT platform, hosting approximately 130,000 students over the 2020/2021
academic year, which was digital from its inception (versus traditional universities that are playing catch up with
online platforms). Students are able to access all video lessons, class materials and mock exams; interact via
video conference with professors and tutors; and even attend exams online, all through user-friendly Pegaso and
Mercatorum websites or mobile apps (first launched in 2018). Superior user experience is also at heart when
Multiversity creates its content for these platforms: while professors create the content, they are supported
throughout by Multiversity IT staff who ensure that materials produced are optimized to be deployed across all
its channels. Multiversity is currently serving one of the largest online student communities in Italy and has a
broad social network presence to further engage with its students.

The company has developed its platform mostly in-house or by personalizing open-source software, achieving a
strong back-end able to deliver seamlessly across all platforms and devices. Multiversity has also fully
transitioned its business to cloud-based servers provided by Amazon Web Services’ (“AWS”) cloud datacenters,
and currently hosts 150 terabyte/month of data storage and relies on a multi-server system, with a load balancer
to manage user traffic overload. This cloud structure adds an additional disaster recovery horizontal layer
(through AWS) to the existing redundant copy stored in the company’s Multimedia Centre in Naples.
Multiversity’s platform, in addition to leveraging the latest technology available such as facial recognition to
confirm student identity, offers advanced proprietary features such as a suggestion tool for its students (enabled
by artificial intelligence and machine learning) that prompts highly relevant content to each individual based on
their career path, grades and progress.

Quality of the IT platform is recognized by students compared to peers and traditional universities, demonstrating
students are highly satisfied with the technological tools at their disposal.

**_Attractive financial profile, with visible revenue, a scalable business model and high cash-flow conversion_**

Multiversity, benefiting from the positive structural tailwinds described above, was able to outpace its reference market
(thanks to the specific strengths of its business model), with Pegaso in particular growing its revenue at a CAGR of
27% from 2018 to 2020. In the academic years 2018/2019-2019/2020, the number of students grew by 22% for the
overall online market.

This growth was embedded with a certain amount visibility, as undergraduates (whose courses have a longer
duration) and freshmen (the vast majority of which stay with Multiversity up to completion of their degrees) had
a significant incidence on overall figures. In particular, undergraduate courses at Multiversity have an average
duration of 2.8 years and a strong conversion rate (40% of graduates from 3-year degree programs apply for 1- or
2-year master’s degrees). In addition, with Multiversity Group churn rates below those of the broader online
market (approximately 5% vs. 6%[90]), the potential negative impact on the overall student base from early exits is
limited, granting additional stability. The average backlog for Pegaso in academic years 2017/2018-2020/2021
was approximately 55%.

These dynamics are of particular relevance given that approximately 55% of the Group’s 2020 revenues were
generated from undergraduate programs, thus allowing valuable visibility on future top-line evolution.

Operating leverage is high, on the back of a significant business model scalability. In particular, the variable
component of our cost base is only related to the contributions recognized to the E-learning Centre Points, which
grow as the business grows. For instance, during the year ended December 31, 2020, contributions recognized to
the E-learning Centre Points accounted for 13% of our total revenues (and 26% of our total cost base), whereas
the advertising costs represented 14%, educational and didactic personnel costs were 4%, headquarters and nondidactic personnel costs were 6%, rental costs were 2% and we recorded 9% of our total revenues for other
expenses. As such, and given the asset-light nature of our business—with investments concentrated our around
IT platform—as our business grows, profitability and cash-flow based metrics are expected to grow more than
proportionally.

**_Significant opportunity to grow beyond the existing perimeter, without significant investments_**

Given Multiversity’s existing leadership position in online higher education, we expect to continue benefitting
from the sector’s structural tailwinds. Not only is the market expected to be larger in absolute size (reaching
379,000 undergraduate students in academic year 2025/2026[91] out of a total addressable base of approximately
1,000,000 individuals, vs. 135,000 as of academic year 2019/2020); it will also benefit from a different mix in
terms of levers of growth, both from a geographic and student profile perspective.

In particular, there is significant geographic white space to be addressed, especially in the Italian Northern
regions. While originally Southern Italy has seen the largest number of undergraduate students, strong growth in
the online undergraduate market will come from the Italian Northern regions, increasing from circa 27% of the
total undergraduate online student base to circa 34% in academic year 2025/2026, adding circa 60,000 new
students and doubling the current absolute number.

In addition, first-timers—which have been the highest growth category over 2015/2016—2019/2020 academic
years, with a 32% CAGR—will continue to increase their relative incidence versus overall undergraduate student
base, moving from 33% in academic year 2015/2016 to 47% expected by academic year 2025/2026.

Multiversity in-house skills and know-how allow the Group to benefit from several opportunities for additional
growth beyond its existing perimeter without the need for significant investments. These opportunities include
B2B and continuous learning, becoming a technology provider and international expansion.

B2B and continuous learning

There are significant opportunities to put the technological platform at the service of a number of prospective
clients for a variety of potential needs. In particular, the pandemic forced many companies to implement distance
learning initiatives for their employees.

Multiversity is already equipped to tap this opportunity through its proprietary technology platform and in-house
content. Leveraging our technological capabilities and the know-how and capabilities of our academic staff,
Multiversity could offer customized platforms, content and innovative learning programs for companies or
specific industries, coupled with our nationwide capillary presence through which we can also offer in-person
lessons.

Technological platform—“White Label”

Multiversity’s proprietary platform and in-house technological capabilities could also be exploited as a product to
be sold to third parties. In order to avoid potential conflicts of interests or providing competitors with our
technology, this offering could be tailored to K-12 or traditional universities addressing distinct student
populations.

International expansion

Although organic international expansion is rendered difficult by divergent regulatory environments and
requirements which reduce our ability to replicate or scale our model, there are potential opportunities in selected
international markets where Italian degrees are relevant and attractive. In particular, we are currently developing
an offering in Turkey, and will selectively expand to other countries by leveraging the same content and platform
to international students seeking an Italian degree recognized across the European Union.

**Strong and Aligned Management team**

Multiversity has a highly experienced and committed management team, with deep education know-how and rich
external professional experience, under the strategic vision of Danilo Iervolino founder of Multiversity and
pioneer in the industry.

The management team is composed of a corporate headquarter and independent academic departments, which
allow the optimal mix between the strategic vision, planning and control, and academic requirements.

**Business Strategy**

We consistently focus on the following elements of our strategy to maintain and strengthen our position as one of
the leading Italian online technology focussed educational groups.

**_We continue to deliver accessible education to students, addressing their needs and contributing to_**
**_democratising higher education learning_**

We believe our commitment to the provision of a high quality online educational experience to our students is the
foundation of our operating performance and growth.

We will continue to offer our students flexibility and constant support throughout their academic careers, an
excellent educational path and a cutting-edge platform, all with a compelling economic proposition. All of this is
possible as we recruit and retain experienced and highly qualified teachers and constantly refresh proprietary
content, with the aim of best positioning our students to respond to the future demands of the job market.
Furthermore, we remain committed to the development of a tailored educational offering and will continue to
implement innovative courses and approaches to education.

We intend to continue our strategy by attracting, retaining and investing in teaching professionals and prominent
Italian experts across various disciplines, all while delivering superior content. In this context, we believe
research plays a key role; our goal is to support our staff with the means and tools to continue to produce updated
content and publications.

We will allocate adequate financial resources to further enhance our tech platform, particularly in cybersecurity,
to support the protection of remote students while maintaining a high standard of service.

In line with the 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”), we remain loyal to our
commitment to ensure an inclusive and fair quality education, to promote opportunities of continuous learning
for everyone and sustainable and inclusive economic growth, facilitating access to honorable job opportunities
for everyone.

**_Continue to deliver educational content through a superior user experience and technology platform,_**
**_investing in improving academic quality and maintaining brand awareness_**

Providing our students with a superior experience is at the core of our operations.

128


-----

To achieve this goal, we will leverage our cutting-edge technological platform and continue improving our web
and mobile applications, with the aim of delivering educational content in the most streamlined, intuitive and
efficient manner as possible. Our IT staff will support our professors to ensure that all content is optimised for
deployment across our various delivery channels and guaranteeing the best possible online academic experience
to our students.

We also intend to continue investing in the back-end of our technological platform to ensure the highest quality
of service. We plan to further improve our cybersecurity operations, as protecting our remote students from
potential risks remains a key priority for us. We intend to continue our roll-out of the most up-to-date
technologies, including facial recognition and artificial intelligence software.

In addition to further developing our technology, we also remain committed to constantly improving the quality
of our academic offering and adapting it to market demand.

We believe that the constant improvement of our digital-born platform and academic offering, coupled with our
commitment to ensuring flawless delivery across all channels, will contribute to maintaining and reinforcing our
brand awareness.

**_Increase enrollment by focusing on segments with unmet demand_**

On the basis of our leadership position and the quality of our offering, we believe we are best positioned to tap
the significant white space in the Italian market, especially in the undergraduate segment. In an effort to address
the widest possible audience with our unique proposition, we will focus on optimizing our marketing and
advertising initiatives (including our presence on digital and traditional channels), strengthening our ELCPs
network and expanding our commercial partnerships.

A high level of student satisfaction is key for us and something we are highly committed to, as it translates into
higher retention rates and, consequently, a higher number of years students spend at Multiversity. We are
strongly convinced in the evolution of the market towards a “continuous learning” model; the more we are able
to retain our students and address their needs, the greater the chance that they will return to Multiversity for their
future educational needs.

**_Maximizing operating and financial performance_**

We continuously monitor and evaluate our operational performance to identify opportunities for enhancement
and to capitalize on embedded growth.

We continue to place significant emphasis on managing our costs efficiently, benefiting from higher operating
leverage and maintaining operational flexibility.

We also seek to consistently generate tuition fee growth above cost inflation—supported by the growing demand
for online education, our strong reputation and the quality of our educational offer—in order to grow our revenue
and expand our margins.

**_Pursue opportunity to grow selectively beyond the existing perimeter, leveraging existing in-house capabilities_**

We will continue to assess and develop opportunity beyond the existing perimeter, such as B2B and continuous
learning, becoming a technology provider, and international expansion.

**Recent Developments**

**_Trading Update_**

Based on our unaudited preliminary management accounts for the YTD period ended August 31, 2021,
Multiversity Group revenue amounted to €181.7 million and increased by 35% compared to the same period
ended August 31, 2020. EBITDA margin YTD period ended August 31, 2021 is generally in line with EBITDA
margin for the YTD period ended June 30, 2021. These results were driven by the increase of new enrollments
for the period and undergraduates students enrolled during previous academic years.

**_Online Universities_**

_Università Telematica Pegaso_

Pegaso is the largest online university in Italy by enrollment,[93] with approximately 105,000 students enrolled for
the 2020/2021 academic year. It is the largest single contributor to Multiversity’s results and accounted for 89%
(€167 million) of Multiversity’s revenues and 86% (€88 million) of Multiversity’s Adjusted EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 81% (€108 million) of Multiversity’s revenues and 76%
(€64 million) of Multiversity’s Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

Pegaso is physically present throughout Italy through its 96 exam centers located in city centers and a network of
approximately 820[94] ELCPs. Pegaso does not require students to pass any admission tests in order to be admitted
to its courses, and does not have any restrictions in terms of the number of students it can accommodate given its
online nature (without the logistical constraints of classrooms and campus facilities) and scalable model.

Pegaso uses IT and online technologies and maintains a proprietary platform capable of managing and making
high quality online university courses accessible to its students. The teaching support specialists who work
alongside teaching staff (tutors, mentors and coaches) assist the student throughout their course of study.
Advanced technological and interactive tools, TV learning and an inclusive online student community are all
tools employed by Pegaso to offer students a distinctive educational experience, bridging the gap between
distance learning and a traditional university experience. Academic qualifications awarded at the end of study
courses have the same legal value as qualifications issued by traditional universities. Pegaso’s online
undergraduate courses, postgraduate master’s courses and training courses represent a one of a kind educational
offer in Italy. Pegaso allows students to study anywhere with a high degree of flexibility (lessons are recorded
and accessible 24/7) and to take exams in one of its 96 examination centers throughout Italy or, recently, due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, online. It is not yet determined whether online examinations will be a permanent
offering or whether this option will be made available to students only during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under
the legislation governing the current state of emergency, academic institutions in Italy have the option to carry
out online examinations until December 31, 2021. Pegaso intends to appeal to the Council of State within the
required timeframe against a decision of the Administrative Court (TAR) of the Lazio region which upheld the
MIUR’s rejection of Pegaso’s proposed amendment to its internal procedures in order to permanently offer
online examinations to its students. See “—Litigation and legal, tax and administrative proceedings” below.

Pegaso has strengthened its international presence through a network of partners worldwide (“POU centers”), in
order to foster the development of its courses and study areas. The POU centers are responsible for conducting
student orientation activities and assistance, as well as providing support to meet local education needs and
facilitate contact with local academic institutions. Approximately six POUs are currently active. The POU based
in Turkey is the most active to date.

_Universitas Mercatorum_

Mercatorum accounted for 9% (€17 million) of Multiversity’s revenues and 6% (€6 million) of its Adjusted
EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 17% (€23 million) of revenues and 16.8%
(€14 million) of Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021. It had approximately 23,000 students
enrolled for the 2020/2021 academic year.

Mercatorum is a non-commercial entity and the first public-private jointly owned university institution in Italy Unioncamere indirectly owns 33.33%. Mercatorum was established with the objective of becoming a market
leader in business training, with a direct linkage to the job market and Italian corporations. As with Pegaso,
Mercatorum does not require students to pass any admission tests in order to be admitted to its courses.

Similarly to Pegaso, Mercatorum also has a strong physical presence throughout Italy, with approximately 800[95]
ELCPs and 56 exam centers (through the Italian chambers of commerce network).

**_Pegaso International_**

Pegaso International Ltd. (“Pegaso International”), headquartered in Malta, is a lifelong learning higher
education institution accredited by the Malta Further & Higher Education Authority. It accounted for less than
1% of Multiversity’s revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 and for

the six months ended June 30, 2021. It provides online courses and other training activities in English and Italian,
and has formed an international network of public and private academic institutions, organizations, companies,
research institutes and foundations globally aimed at facilitating access to study.

Thanks to its political, cultural and strategic location in southern Europe, Pegaso International aims at building
and spreading a platform of knowledge in a global perspective. More specifically, Pegaso International aims to
promote the development of the geographical area in which it is located (i.e. southern Europe and the
Mediterranean region) through lifelong learning, by providing international students worldwide with flexible,
inclusive and accessible education.

Pegaso International is currently being subjected to a routine evaluation by an external commission appointed by
the Malta Further & Higher Education Authority (“MFHEA”) in order to obtain the renewal of its license as a
Maltese higher education institution, which expires in January 2022. The on-site visits and other components of
the evaluation are expected to be completed in early 2022.

**_Certifications_**

_Certipass_

Certipass accounted for 1.7% (€3.2 million) of Multiversity’s revenues as of December 31, 2020 and 1.7%
(€2.2 million) for the six months ended June 30, 2021.[96] Over 678,977 users have purchased EIPASS digital
services since 2009.

Certipass is a provider of international certifications for digital and IT skills known as “EIPASS”. EIPASS, the
European Informatics Passport, is a program for the certification of digital competences in line with European
standards, recognized throughout Europe. All EIPASS certificates are devised with common standards at
international level, which is necessary for the recognition of the digital certificate in different countries and is of
significant use to companies requiring qualified personnel.

Certipass users have the choice from a wide spectrum of qualifications, depending on their learning level (basic/
intermediate/advanced). Certipass offers 19 different EIPASS certifications.

Certipass is recognized and accredited by the MIUR both in Italy and the rest of the EU. Preparation for exams
takes place through DIDASKO, a 3.0 online classroom proprietary platform, internally developed by Certipass,
which includes all the necessary teaching material in e-book format as well as assessment simulations, interactive
channels through which to communicate with customer service or an EIPASS trainer or EIPASS Study Center.
Certipass is also active through approximately 1,300 EIPASS Points which on-sell EIPASS certifications to
customers and has 3,400 EIPASS trainers.[97]

The Certipass certification has an addressable market of its own, but is also highly complementary as an add-on
for students of Pegaso and Mercatorum that are pursuing an undergraduate or postgraduate degree.

_Language Certifications_

Through its language center, Pegaso offers a number of language certifications, most prominently the English
Lion Certification (“ELC”). The ELC is a B2 level language certification created and delivered exclusively by
Pegaso, inspired by the principles set forth by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages
(CEFR). Pegaso is the first online university in Italy to have created its own language certification. The ELC is
an officially recognized certification under the Italian education framework, pursuant to Ministerial Decree no.
353 of May 23, 2014.

**_Academies_**

Pegaso and Mercatorum have established a number of specialized academies in collaboration with its business
partners, as summarised below. Multiversity is also developing further partnerships and academies as part of its
strategy to form close relationships with employers with the aim of developing skills in various vertical sectors
through its unique teaching methods.

96 As at December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, Certipass was consolidated by Multiversity using the proportional method, in relation to its
shareholding of 50%. The data shown is therefore reflective of the shareholding of Multiversity.

connection with the concession agreement entered into on June 20, 2019 with the Municipality of Agerola in the
Campania region. The agreement governs the management and use of the property Colonia Montana Principe di
_Napoli as a center for higher education and postgraduate studies in the gastronomy and tourism sectors. The_
center was designated as such by the Municipality of Agerola following a public tender awarded pursuant to
decision no. 105 of the Municipal Council (Giunta Comunale) of Agerola dated September 14, 2018 and by the
subsequent authorization no. 140 granted on September 19, 2018 by the Public Works and Environmental Unit of
the Municipality of Agerola.

Principe di Napoli is led by Heinz Beck (three Michelin star chef) as scientific director and offers, through
Pegaso and Mercatorum, three degree courses, three vocational training courses and five amateur courses, with
the possibility of interning at one of Heinz Beck’s restaurants.

Since Principe di Napoli offers in-person courses on its premises, the courses are currently suspended due to the
COVID-19 pandemic and the current state of emergency.

**_Postgraduate School in Legal Professions_**

The Postgraduate School in Legal Professions, offered in partnership between Pegaso and Mercatorum, offers
skills training to Italian magistrates, lawyers and notaries, including practical legal training through the use of
role play. Courses take place at Pegaso’s and Mercatorum’s offices in Naples and Rome, as well as in e-learning
modules. The in-person teaching is divided into intensive training sessions, so as to facilitate study alongside
other professional activities.

**_Digital Learning for Schools_**

_LAF School_

134


-----

Sannio), of which Pegaso owns a 63% stake as of 2020 (increased from 20.27% in 2019). Multiversity’s decision
to increase its stake was driven by the need to centralize its research activities, with a particular focus on
environmental sustainability matters.

Benecon is responsible for carrying out analysis and territorial redevelopment, through the recovery and
maintenance of landscape, archaeological and urban settings. In addition, it engages in the design and
construction of ‘green companies’ and eco-museum structures.

**Offering**

Multiversity’s core offerings, which make up its largest revenue share and student base, are its undergraduate
bachelor’s degree courses in the areas of economics and business administration (nine courses), engineering (six
courses), teaching and training (eight courses) and law and legal services (three course) offered across
Multiversity’s institutions and are the courses that are expected to be the most in demand over the next five years.
However, one of the strengths of Multiversity’s offering is its large and diversified portfolio of courses, designed
to appeal to a broad demographic.

The following table shows the current course offering, course duration and tuition fee range on a per-course basis

**_Pegaso International_**

Pegaso International offers four bachelor’s degrees, EQF/MQF Level 6, in Italian and English, in the areas of
Business Administration, Civil Engineering, Education Sciences, and Exercise Science.

It offers a bachelor’s degree, EQF/MQF Level 7, delivered in English, in Informatics, with a duration of one
year. It also offers a newly accredited, English-language PhD, EQF/MQF Level 8, in Sustainable Development,
for which course content is in development.

In addition to the accredited courses, Pegaso International offers some courses held accredited by Pegaso such as
a three-year bachelor’s degree in Tourism Sciences, a master’s degree in Economics and a five-year single-cycle
degree (laurea magistrale) in Law, and a PhD in Law, Education and Development.

Pegaso International’s annual tuition fee for the degree courses is €3,000 euros. Some agreements with certain
commercial partners have been entered into providing for the application of preferential rates equal to €2,000 per
academic year.

107 In partnership with Pegaso.

108 No fee is payable by successful Ph.D. candidates, who receive a grant from the university to conduct research for the duration of the
Ph.D.

109 Total number of enrolled students includes an additional 224 students enrolled in the undergraduate degree course Tourism Sciences,
which has been discontinued as of the 21/22 academic year

137


-----

The cost of the PhD is €7,500 for the terms of the three year course (if paid as one lump sum, upon enrollment,
the student will be entitled to a preferential rate totalling €6,000).

For the 2020/2021 academic year, 715 students were enrolled in Pegaso International (90 undergraduate courses
and 625 in postgraduate and language courses).

_Ancillary Fees and Services_

Various other services are offered to the students Pegaso and, where indicated, Mercatorum for additional fees,
representing additional revenue streams, such as:

Undergraduate ancillary fees and services:

- Alternative exam location fee (equal to €150): this service, applicable to students of Pegaso and Mercatorum
and payable on an annual basis, enables the student to attend the exam sessions in alternative examination
centers outside of the default location in Naples (as regards Pegaso) or Rome (as regards Mercatorum).
Paying such fee allows the student to attend examinations at any of the other exam centers amongst
Pegaso’s 96 or Mercatorum’s 56 locations across Italy;

- Supplemental tuition fee (equal to €282[110]): payable by default by each student of Pegaso in the first year of
undergraduate enrollment;

- Certificate fee (€50 per certificate): payable in order to obtain official transcripts or other official university
documents from either of Pegaso or Mercatorum; and

- Supplemental diploma fee (equal to €70): payable by students in order to obtain an additional copy
supplementing the official qualification obtained at the end of a course of study. The supplemental diploma
provides a description of the nature, level, context, content and status of the studies carried out and
completed by the student according to a standard eight point model, developed at the initiative of the
European Commission, the Council of Europe and UNESCO, and is in Italian and English.

Postgraduate ancillary fees and services:

- Supplemental tuition fee (equal to €116[111]): payable by default by each student of Pegaso upon postgraduate
enrollment;

- Certificate fee (equal to €50 per certificate): payable in order to obtain official transcripts or other official
university certifications from either Pegaso or Mercatorum.

_Learning Method_

Multiversity’s e-learning institutions’ educational methods involve setting learning objectives (units of learning
content) that are to be achieved through a multitude of tools, materials and services. For each video class, these
are:

- the written core text of the lecture, with bibliographical references and notes;

- slides (supplemented with text, tables, images, graphs) with audio commentary by the lecturer;

- video recordings of the lessons, available to view in either real-time or subsequently at any other time on the
online platform; and

- self-assessment exercises to evaluate the student’s progress.

Final examinations take place at Multiversity’s examination centers throughout Italy (or, in the case of Pegaso
International, Malta) and are overseen by a commission appointed by the rector and chaired by a university
professor. During the COVID-19 pandemic, due to emergency measures adopted by the government, exams have
been taking place online through the platform.

In order to complete a specific course, students are required to:

- carry out a number of interim assessments (on-line tests to verify learning stages, development of papers,
any laboratory activities, etc.);

- view at least 80% of the online lessons available on the platform; and

- pass the final examination, to be taken in person at the university facilities (or, for so long as emergency
measures are in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, online).

110 Previously €172 until February 2020

111 Previously €50 until February 2020

138


-----

Within each course, students are subject, for each discipline, to interim assessments which are compulsory but
not a prerequisite to qualify for the final examination, in order to constantly monitor learning levels. The
assessments may consist of tests (closed-answer, open-answer, multiple-choice, etc.), exercises, simulations or
group projects.

_Credit and qualification frameworks_

Pegaso and Mercatorum’s undergraduate courses confer the qualifications provided for under the Italian
Qualifications Framework, as established by the Italian Ministry of Education in accordance with the
Qualifications Framework for the European Higher Education Area.

The European Credit Transfer System (“ECTS”), an EU-wide education metric aimed at making studies and
courses more transparent, applies to the courses offered at Multiversity’s core institutions. This allows students to
move between countries to obtain their academic qualifications and study periods abroad which are recognized
by allowing credits taken at one higher educational institution to be counted towards a qualification acquired at
another educational institution. One CFU is equivalent to one ECTS credit and students must cover
approximately one third of studies online in order to meet the requirements to pass the examinations

Pegaso International’s courses provide qualifications recognised under the ECTS system, applied within the
European Qualification Framework (“EQF”). The EQF is an eight-level learning outcomes-based framework for
all types of qualifications that serves as a harmonisation tool between different national qualifications
frameworks. This framework helps improve transparency, comparability and portability of qualifications and
makes it possible to compare qualifications from different countries and institutions. The EQF covers all types
and all levels of qualifications and the use of learning outcomes to acknowledge the actual skills and
qualifications of individuals. The level increases according to the level of proficiency, level 1 being the lowest
and level 8 the highest. Courses offered by Pegaso International are EQF level 6 or level 7. The EQF is closely
linked to national qualifications frameworks, thereby providing a comprehensive map of all types and levels of
qualifications in Europe, which are increasingly accessible through qualification databases.

_Amount of content available and frequency of refresh_

The course content is typically refreshed every three years. However, some courses that by their very nature are
subject to more frequent updates, such as law or legal studies, are updated as required on a rolling basis (usually
every six months) by academic staff. Each professor is required to confirm on an annual basis that the teaching
materials relating to their courses are up-to-date.

_Quality assurance_

In order to ensure the professionalism and quality of degree courses, the MIUR conducts quality assessments
through the Agenzia Nazionale di Valutazione Del Sistema Universitario e della Ricerca (the Agency for the
Evaluation of the University and Research System or “ANVUR”), which is vested with the authority to, among
other things, evaluate procedures, results and outputs of institutions’ management, teaching, research and
technological transfer activities, and conduct the rankings of merit and prestige of both traditional and online
universities. The assignment of such rankings is a legal requirement for the operation of (i) universities offering
at least 30% of courses as distance learning courses or (ii) online universities, which are both scored on a scale
from A-tel (very positive) to E-tel (unsatisfactory), with the consequential closure of the online delivery platform
in the event of a negative outcome.

In its most recent research quality evaluation, the commission of experts appointed by ANVUR assigned a Level
C-tel score to both Pegaso and Mercatorum (respectively the second and third highest scores with respect to the
other Italian online universities in 2017),[112] corresponding to a satisfactory grade in accordance with applicable
Italian regulations.

The periodic accreditation assessments are processed following on-site visits to the universities by the
commission appointed by ANVUR. The periodic accreditation visits are carried out in three phases: (i) a remote
examination of the documentation made available by the university to the commission, (ii) the actual on-site visit
in order to examine the degree programs and the departments selected by ANVUR for each university and
(iii) the drafting of a report by the commission. See “Regulation” below.

Pegaso International, as a provider authorized to deliver courses of study with MFHEA (formerly NCFHE)
License n.2006-001, is required to ensure compliance with the ten standards of quality assurance established by
the MFHEA in the performance of its internal administrative and teaching procedures. The MFHEA conducts
periodic audits of providers to determine compliance with QA requirements and the subsequent renewal of the
license.

112 https://www.anvur.it/attivita/ava/accreditamento-periodico/rapporti-anvur-di-accreditamento-periodico/

139


-----

Pegaso International is periodically evaluated by an external commission appointed by the MFHEA in order to
obtain the renewal of its license as a Higher Education Institution, which is due to be evaluated in February 2022.

In view of the audit, all operational procedures have been drawn up in an internal quality assurance manual and
evaluated through a self-assessment process whose results, reported in a self-assessment report, have been
presented to the panel of Auditors.

The assessment of the submitted documentation will be followed by an on-location visit and interviews with
faculty, students, staff and management, and will be completed in early 2022.

For further information on the quality assurance framework to which the universities of Multiversity are subject.
See “Regulation” below.

_Performance monitoring systems for academic staff_

Although there is no requirement under the applicable Italian legislative framework to monitor the performance
of academic staff in private universities, Pegaso and Mercatorum have both established the respective
procedures, as indicated in the “Quality Assurance” section of their respective websites. There are also models
for evaluation of professors by students (required by ANVUR) which are carried out periodically. The
performance of university professors is also evaluated on the number of academic papers published by them (i.e.
on the basis of their personal research track record).

Professors are contractually required to ensure their course materials remain up to date and the majority of the
materials are updated on a rolling basis, while a full content update is required every three years.

See “—Employment—Faculty training and development” below.

**Awards/Accolades**

In the most recent research quality evaluation carried out by ANVUR in 2017, Mercatorum’s business law course
was ranked first in Italy among small universities.

**Research**

**_General_**

In line with the general principles set out in its articles of association, the universities of Multiversity (Pegaso and
Mercatorum) promote the international development of teaching, research and studies, in particular through
cultural exchange between countries and by instituting collaborations with the most prestigious universities in the
EU.

With regard to Mercatorum, its core mission focuses on recognizing equal dignity and importance of all cultures,
and the opportunity to evolve through research and teaching. This mission is pursued through development of
professional competence in the educational process, fostering conditions favourable to raising the moral and civil
awareness of students, setting up academic activities on the basis of meritocratic and transparent criteria,
protection of integrity and individuality of each student and promotion of the values of equality and social
responsibility.

For further information about each university’s rankings, see “Regulation” below.

Multiversity’s institutions are very active in funding campaigns focusing on training and research. In respect of
Mercatorum, since 2020 grants related to 45 projects have been awarded for a total amount of approximately
€1.7 million (of which approximately €1,1 million was awarded in 2021). In respect of Pegaso, since 2019,
grants related to 21 research projects have been awarded for a total amount of €4.1 million.

In 2020, numerous three-year research projects were launched totalling approximately €916 thousand, financed
in part (€260 thousand) with funds from the ‘5 per mille’ (0.05% accrual collected from Italian taxpayers, a
portion of which is distributed to research and education institutions) allocated to universities by the MIUR.
Grants and research projects contributed to approximately 1% of Pegaso’s revenues and 8% of Mercatorum’s
revenues in each case for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Over the past three years, Multiversity’s institutions have been involved in the publication of more than 30
research volumes in various subjects, including psychology, philosophy, law and economics.

**_Benecon_**

In accordance with its corporate mission, Benecon carries out scientific research into airborne sensors,
specifically aircraft that are designed to perform aerial remote sensing actions thanks to hyperspectral, thermal,
photographic sensors developed by Benecon for the monitoring of environmental matrices (air-land-water). Two
researchers out of a total of Benecon’s 15-strong team are from Pegaso.

Benecon is sponsored by UNESCO and therefore participates in its international research projects in conjunction
with other UNESCO partners.

Because of the average tuition fee applied by Multiversity’s institutions (pursuant to the captive agreements that
provide for the application of reduced corporate rates for certain categories of students—see “—Preferential and
_corporate rates” below) and the duration of the various categories of courses identified in the table above, the_
absolute number of enrollments is not indicative of the weight of tuition fee revenue, being just one of the key
indicators of Multiversity’s revenue streams. The evolution of the student base demonstrates a fast-growing trend
in the undergraduate degree offering, which represents the largest contribution to revenue given the higher tuition
fee, ancillary services revenue on top of the tuition fee and duration of the students’ academic career
(undergraduate degrees have a duration spanning from three to five years, whilst postgraduate courses), whilst
showing a decline in enrollments in postgraduate and individual courses. The latter is due to the seasonality
effect linked to public tenders (concorsi pubblici) for specific professions such as teachers. Such public tenders
are usually carried out every two years by the public administration and therefore the decrease in enrollments for
the 2020/2021 academic year is expected to be recovered once the tenders are launched once again by the public
administration in the coming year. Such expected recovery will be further positively affected by the expected
increase of hirings in the public education sector in Italy.

**_Demographics of Multiversity’s Student Population_**

Undergraduate students form the majority of Multiversity’s institutions’ student base. In particular, there is a
high incidence of younger generations and first-timers and students from southern Italy, the latter being reflective
of Pegaso and Mercatorum’s origins as universities based in the southern and central regions of Italy. However,
the volume of students from northern Italy has steadily increased in recent years. The demographic profile of
Multiversity’s student population plays a critical role for its operations, with undergraduate students building the
majority of Multiversity’s institutions’ student base. For the academic year 2020/2021, 65% of the total number
of Multiversity’s institutions’ students were enrolled in undergraduate courses whereas 35% of its students were
enrolled in graduate courses. In addition, students aged 18-34 represented approximately 70% of the total number
of enrolled undergraduate students in 2020/2021 academic year, compared with approximately 60% for the

-----

2019/2020 academic year. First-timers (i.e. students accessing higher education for the first time) accounted for
47% of the total number of enrolled undergraduate students in 2020/2021 academic year, compared with 44% in
the previous academic year, and are expected to grow further in the near future.

The student base is mainly composed of students coming from Southern Italy, both in the undergraduate courses
(61% for the 2020/2021 academic year) and the postgraduate courses (52% for the 2020/2021 academic year). A
strong expansion of Multiversity’s student base into Northern Italy can be observed for enrollments in both
undergraduate courses (23% in the academic year 2020/2021 as compared to 15% in the academic year
2018/2019) and postgraduate courses (25% in the academic year 2020/2021).

For further details on the breakdown of Pegaso and Mercatorum’s undergraduate and postgraduate student
population for the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 academic years by age, geographical provenance and the incidence
of first timers, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Key Performance Indicators.”_

The overall churn rate across Pegaso and Mercatorum for the 2020/2021 academic year was equal to
approximately 5%.

The value of sales and services amounting to €132,963,726 euro as at June 30, 2021, mainly includes revenues
deriving from the educational offer of Multiversity’s universities, training courses and EIPASS cards offered by
Certipass, and all other operating income related to teaching. The increase over the period is mostly due to the
growing number of new enrollments in the universities. Almost all of Multiversity’s revenues are derived in
Italy, given that the operations are almost entirely based and performed in Italy.

**_Preferential and corporate rates_**

Pegaso has in place over 1,350 commercial agreements securing captive customers which provide for the
application of corporate rates for undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses. The majority of these provide
for the application of a reduced tuition fee with respect to the full tuition fee (as set out above in “—Offering”).
Such reduced tuition fees range from €1,500 to €2,000 per annum for undergraduate degree courses, depending
on the terms of the relevant agreement. Mercatorum has similar agreements in place with approximately 202,
mainly public, entities, including the employees of the Italian chambers of commerce and of the ELCPs, and
members of the armed forces. Mercatorum also has a number of programs in place providing for the application
of discounted rates to pregnant women and people with disabilities, among others. The reduced tuition fees range
from €800 to €2,000 per annum for undergraduate degree courses.

The vast majority of students enrolled at Pegaso and Mercatorum are entitled to the application of reduced
corporate rates under such agreements, a strong indication that the volume and geographic distribution of
Multiversity’s commercial partnerships across the Italian territory, coupled with the appeal of an innovative and
flexible training method, is key to Multiversity’s business strategy.

**_Student funding_**

Tuition fees paid to Multiversity are in the majority of cases funded by the students themselves, with the very
rare use of scholarships. There are no instances of payment by employers on behalf of their employees, nor of
students benefiting from government loans.

142


-----

In terms of preferred payment method, approximately 60% of tuition fees are paid via bank transfer, with the
remainder mainly paid online.

In respect of undergraduate courses and academic master’s degrees, payment of tuition fees is due in four equal
instalments payable in November, May, June and July of each academic year. The tuition fees for postgraduate
master’s courses and single courses are paid as a lump sum payment.

**Employment**

**_Number of employees (including faculty members) by entity_**

As at June 30, 2021, Multiversity employed a total of 1,080 people on a permanent or temporary basis across its
institutions, including extraordinary professors (i.e. professors with fixed term contract falling within the scope
of article 1, comma 12 of Law no. 230 of 2005), tutors and administrative staff, of which 670 are retained by
Pegaso, 410 by Mercatorum and 15 by Certipass.

The below table illustrates the current breakdown of teaching staff and administrative staff employed across
Multiversity and its core institutions.

The table above does not include Pegaso International, Benecon and other minor entities. Of these, the most
relevant employer is Pegaso International which has entered into employment contracts with approximately 100
professors for the purposes of producing course content and materials for the five undergraduate degrees
currently offered by the institution, and two further courses that are currently in development but not yet
accredited.

In terms of cost of personnel for Multiversity, the table below illustrates the entire expense for employees
(excluding contract professors and other academic staff engaged by Multiversity as external consultants)

The increase shown above is mainly due to the increase in the number of employees of Pegaso and Mercatorum
as a result of increased enrollments and the expansion of the course offering which has led, among other things,
to increased revenue growth.

Academic staff is recruited through either a public bid process with respect to the associate and tenured
professors, researchers and rectors or through a CV selection process with respect to extraordinary professors,
tutors and contract professors. Academic staff tend to come from traditional universities, often the institutions at
which they qualified and had subsequently gained teaching experience.

**_Remuneration of Professors and Researchers_**

The Italian national legislative framework on the remuneration of professors, which sets out in specific tables the
range of wages payable to tenured professors and associate professors at all universities across the country (such
wages varying on the grade of professor and based on whether the professors are permanent professors[117] or full
term professors[118], provided that both tenured professors and associate professors are employed under permanent
contracts) and researchers, which are instead employed on fixed term contracts. Such statutory provisions apply
to all universities, with no distinction between public or private, “traditional” or online universities. Specifically,
pursuant to Italian Presidential Decree 232/2011 (“PR 232”), specifying the regulations governing the
remuneration of university professors and researchers, and setting out the aforementioned tables (as updated from
time to time based on the calculations carried out by ISTAT), the following range of annual wages will apply for
each main category of professor employed at Pegaso and Mercatorum:

**Category of professor** **Approximate wage range (p.a.)**

Tenured Professor (permanent) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €75,500-131,500
Tenured Professor (full term) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 49,500-72,000
Associate Professor (permanent) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 53,000-96,000
Associate Professor (full term) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 36,000-54,500
Researcher (permanent) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 36,000-47,000
Researcher (full term) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 26,000-34,000

The level of remuneration applicable to the relevant professor within the ranges specific above will depend on
the grade of such professor. Following an assessment of the relevant professor’s scientific production (e.g.,
researches activities, publications, etc.) and a formal evaluation based on criteria regulated by law, tenured and
associate professors may progress to a higher grade every three years, thereby becoming entitled to the next level
of remuneration.

Researchers have temporary contracts that may be: (a) 3 years contracts, with the possibility of a 2 further years
extension[119] for once, based on an assessment of the educational and research activities carried out; or (b) 3 years

117 Pursuant to Article 6 of Law 240/2010, for the purposes of reporting of the research activities, the annual activities of research, study and
teaching, with the related preparatory tasks, verification and organization, is equal to 1,500 hours per year for permanent professors and
researchers. Furthermore, permanent professors carry out research and scientific updating activities and, on the basis of criteria and
procedures established by university regulations, are required to allocate annually for teaching and student service tasks, including
orientation and tutoring, as well as activities of verification of learning, not less than 350 hours.

118 Pursuant to Article 6 of Law 240/2010, for the purposes of reporting of the research activities, the annual activities of research, study and
teaching, with the related preparatory tasks, verification and organization, is equal to 750 hours per year for full term professors and
researchers. Furthermore, full term professors carry out research and scientific updating activities and, on the basis of criteria and
procedures established by university regulations, are required to allocate annually for teaching and student service tasks, including
orientation and tutoring, as well as activities of verification of learning, not less than 250 hours.

119 Researchers falling in this category may be qualified either as permanent or full term. Pursuant to Article 24, paragraph 4, of Law
240/2010, the total annual commitment for the teaching, supplementary teaching and student service activities is 350 hours for permanent
researchers and 200 hours for full term researchers.

contracts without possibility of extension.[120] In this respect, it is worth noting that the remuneration due to
researchers under letter (b) above may be increased up to a maximum of 30%.

In respect of extraordinary professors and contract professors appointed by Pegaso and Mercatorum, PR 232 does
not apply. Such professors have temporary contracts and are paid based on their actual work. The below table
sets out the range of annual wages applied by Pegaso and Mercatorum to extraordinary professors and contract
professors:

**Category of professor** **Approximate wage range (p.a.)**

Extraordinary Professor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €5,000-30,000
Contract Professor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 3,000-5,000

**_Stock option plan and incentives_**

At its meeting held on May 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of Multiversity approved a stock option plan
comprising 1000 options with regard to the shares of Multiversity S.r.l. (the “Plan”) for the benefit of directors,
employees and/or collaborators of the Group and its subsidiaries to be identified by the Board of Directors from
time to time.

The Multiversity shareholders’ meeting of June 25, 2021 approved a non-proportional share capital increase by a
nominal amount equal to €1,000 in favour of some key managers of the Group, who have been assigned the
option rights to subscribe the capital increase once some relevant conditions are met. The stock options conferred
pursuant to the Plan can be exercised upon the occurrence of certain events and subject to certain conditions.
Since the key conditions are not met at the time of preparation of the Multiversity Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements, the share capital was not subscribed. Such new shares are reserved for
subscription within the final deadline of December 31, 2035.

The key managers of the Group, as approved by the Board of Directors meeting held in February 2021, are
attributed a bonus if some key parameters, in terms of Group and individual economic performance are met,
based on the year end results. An estimate of year-end bonuses is accrued in the Group financial statements.

_Faculty retention and churn rates_

The associate or tenured professors of Pegaso or Mercatorum that were originally in the organization have rarely
left the Multiversity educational institutions voluntarily. In certain instances, faculty staff employed on
temporary contracts have been offered positions elsewhere. Professors that are not tenured are engaged through
fixed term contracts, which are renewed on an annual basis. Many junior professors are employed as researchers
on fixed term contracts and are subsequently employed indefinitely after winning tenure as associates.

Researchers are offered a three-year contract that may be extended by the institution for a further two years if
their research meets certain criteria.

As part of Multiversity’s talent retention strategy, temporary personnel that qualify for associate professorship
typically commence the process of becoming tenured professors within approximately four months.

_Faculty training and development_

Pegaso has opened a Teaching and Learning Center dedicated to the training of faculty members with a particular
focus on remote learning techniques. Mandatory training courses are also made available to professors on the elearning platform (e.g. techniques/guides for organizing materials, courses on interactive teaching) and training
for tutors (led by more experienced tutors and professors).

The same applies to Mercatorum where, in addition, given the university’s assistance to the Italian chambers of
commerce, focus groups are established to monitor and study legislative developments that are relevant to the
chambers of commerce.

With a view to attracting talent, the Boards of Directors of the two universities consider all faculty who have
passed into the first rank for the role of full professor, which is an uncommon practice in the industry.

**Student Orientation and Marketing and Sales**

Around 60% of total students across Pegaso and Mercatorum partake in orientation activities at the ELCPs that
make up Multiversity’s national network. Approximately 40% of students are reached through traditional

120 Researchers falling in this category may only be qualified as permanent. .

marketing methods, e.g. billboards and televised advertising campaigns on both private and public Italian
channels, as well as through its extensive online presence on social media and online advertising, thereby gaining
access to the widest possible audience. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, advertising costs represented,
together with the contributions payable to the ELCPs for their educational activities, approximately 54%[117] of
Multiversity’s total consolidated costs. Students are on-boarded and enrolled directly by Pegaso or Mercatorum,
as applicable, which retain full control of the enrollment process and maintain direct contact with the student.

Along with as its numerous websites, Pegaso has a significant online following on all major social media outlets.
Pegaso also runs an online streaming channel, UniPegaso TV, on which users can stream video content such as
descriptions of the courses offered and interviews with current students as well academic staff. In addition, the
online blog “MyPegaso” is open to contributions from teachers, researchers and students.

**Technology Platform**

The e-learning platform utilized by Pegaso and Mercatorum, which is proprietary and owned by Multiversity[118],
was among the first e-learning platforms in Italy to be run through mobile applications, combining innovative
technology with modern e-learning methods. Key characteristics of the platform are the following:

- the platform may be run from any device, including iOS and Android;

- student-friendly and available 24 hours a day;

- allows immediate access to the entire online university educational offering;

- creates and encourages student community in an online hub, aimed at team building and the stimulation of
ideas for the creation of new businesses; and

- contains interactive modules with innovative live-chat technology including multichannel chat systems,
videochat and virtual classrooms, as well as online self-assessment (exercises and mock tests).

Students can—via the app (first launched in 2018) or web platform—watch lessons, access class materials and
thematic blogs, interact with professors and tutors, participate with other students in the social community.

Course content is prepared by academic staff, with the support of Multiversity IT staff who, among other things,
professionally edit files and enable their delivery across all e-learning platforms. All original course content is
owned by the relevant institutions of Multiversity.

Certipass uses only a small part of the Multiversity e-learning platform, as it has developed its own proprietary
platform which is used solely for the assessments required to grant the EIPASS certifications. Certipass uses the
same cybersecurity and data protection systems as Multiversity.

**_Core systems_**

Multiversity has continuously invested in its IT platform and systems from its inception in order to deliver the
highest quality online learning platform.

The platform does not run on external software and is entirely owned by Multiversity. The e-learning platforms
and core systems are developed fully in-house, originally leveraging an open-source software that was
customized to develop a unique proprietary platform. Since 2017, the platform has been run and stored on servers
hosted by AWS cloud data centers to maximize efficiency, with horizontal and physical back-up for disaster
recovery. A backup copy of the stored data is kept at the data center at Pegaso’s headquarters in Naples, which is
activated in the event of disaster recovery to ensure zero time loss of service. The current package contracted
with AWS is for 150 terabyte/month of data storage and relies on a multi-server system, with a load balancer to
manage user traffic overload.

In the period from 2018 to 2020, Multiversity launched: (i) a mobile app; (ii) a platform for online exams, due to
the impossibility of taking exams in person given COVID restrictions; and (iii) machine learning algorithms that
guide the user in the learning experience and increase their qualifications and skills. Through the use of cookies
and app tracking, personalized content is provided to users with respect to their university career, including
suggestions for postgraduate pathways and invitations to continue studying if certain academic targets are
reached.

117 Net of depreciation and devaluation

118 By means of a deed dated October 25, 2019, Multiversity S.p.A. transferred the business unit that carries out university training support
services, including proprietary rights in the IT platform to Multiversity S.r.l. As a result of the aforementioned contribution, all existing
relationships and all new activities relating to the aforementioned business unit are managed by Multiversity S.r.l.

-----

Multiversity has registered the IT platform’s trademark, “Iuniversity” with the Italian Society of Authors and
Publishers (“SIAE”), the algorithm underlying the platform’s flowchart having also been registered in the public
register of software held by SIAE. Pegaso, Mercatorum and Pegaso International use Multiversity’s proprietary
IT platform in order to deliver their courses.

Multiversity’s IT team is currently composed of 25 employees.

A new web version of the platform was launched over the summer of 2021, incorporating several updates
including a new design, more interactive interface and other user experience improvements.

While delayed by the COVID pandemic, Multiversity is in the process of obtaining the following ISO
certifications:

- UNI EN ISO 9001:2015;

- UNI EN ISO 14001:2015;

- UNI EN ISO 45001:2018;

- UNI EN ISO 20000:2018;

- UNI EN ISO 22301:2012; and

- UNI EN ISO 27001:2013.

_Evaluation and compliance of IT platform_

Pegaso and Mercatorum must meet legal requirements, which are reviewed by the ANVUR Evaluation
Committee every five years. Pegaso and Mercatorum scored high rankings/ratings with respect to the technology
used during the last evaluation in October 2017.

Under the previous legislative framework, periodic evaluations needed to be carried out every five years through
a five-day site visit by the ANVUR Evaluation Committee. Pegaso obtained the highest rating among online
universities during the last periodic evaluation and on that basis the site visit (which would be necessary in case
of an insufficient rating) is no longer required. As a result, it is sufficient to provide a report to the ANVUR
Evaluation Committee. The most recent report was provided to the ANVUR Evaluation Committee on June 30,
2021.

_Cybersecurity_

Multiversity has established and maintains cybersecurity systems that are developed and updated internally,
including a monitoring system that monitors the platform and code transactions on it. The cloud data centers are
only accessible through Pegaso’s headquarters in Naples, by authorized members of the IT team through a
two-tier security system. In particular, Multiversity employs a cybersecurity program leased from Amazon in
order to protect against the risk of DDoS[119] cyber-attacks.

Users’ passwords are tokenized; access to servers is allowed only through the network and firewalls present at
the business center at headquarters. Access to all externally-facing applications is protected by a web application
firewall and users are required to register and create a personal profile accessible through a username and
password, which is encrypted and tokenized, ensuring that the specific user may only view areas within the
application to which it has been granted access. In addition, a secure hash algorithm protects users’ stored
credentials on the server side. The security measures adopted under the platform ensure protection of user’s
personal data in compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection
Regulation or “GDPR”) and Multiversity provides information to its employees on an annual basis as to the data
protection measures that need to be put in place. Multiversity has procedures in place for data collection and
processing in accordance with the GDPR and Italian applicable law (including in order to ensure that any
revocation of permission by users to process their personal data is actioned within 24 hours).

In terms of client/server side security, the devices used by the students and academic staff are separate and there
is no direct client-side access to the servers.

In terms of protection against data loss, a back-up copy of stored data is accessible from the data center at
Pegaso’s headquarters in Naples and is activated in the event of disaster recovery to ensure zero time loss of

119 ‘Denial of Service’ cyber attacks in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users
by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.

service. In the event of a system memory overload, temporary servers are created ensuring sufficient system
memory/CPU to run the platform. Through the use of this system, the platform does not have a limit to the
maximum number of users that may access it simultaneously.

Multiversity carries out penetration tests internally every time a new IT procedure is created, and risk
assessments are also carried out on an annual basis and in conjunction with any penetration test).

_Future developments_

Multiversity’s focus is to invest further in cybersecurity to continue to strengthen its (already advanced) IT
platforms.

There may also be opportunities for expansion to provide IT services to third parties or, in the case of the
purchase or establishment of additional online institutions, to migrate them to Multiversity’s systems. However,
this may involve substantial investment.

_Key differentiating platform features_

The following characteristics are the key differentiating features of Multiversity’s IT platform:

- the platform is entirely responsive;

- all the functions that are accessible through the web browser are also available on the application for mobile
devices;

- it uses a social learning system to assist users in the study process by enabling the formation of an online
student community.

In addition, the platform employs machine learning algorithms that propose the best paths for the training of
specific users. The study process “adapts” to the user performance, raising or lowering the difficulty of the
learning model according to the user’s intermediate results. For example, the algorithm may suggest additional
exercises on subject where students underperformed, or, alternatively, more advanced studies to highly
performing students. Such algorithm is used to market additional learning pathways to individual users, through
the use of cookies, tracking apps, questionnaires, grades, the number of times that an exam is repeated and other
tools.

**Presence and Property**

**_Number of locations/centers (available venues) by entity_**

Overall, Multiversity has contractual arrangements in place with service providers for the operation of
approximately 3,000[120] ELCPs across Italy. The table below summarizes the number of ELCPs and exam centers
by entity as at September 30, 2021.

Multiversity’s headquarters, the Group’s administration in Naples where the Group’s management, teaching,
technical-IT, administrative and financial offices are located, is rented from the Group company Bellerofonte
S.r.l. The headquarters of Pegaso located in Naples in Piazza Trieste e Trento are leased from Mr. Danilo
Iervolino. See further “Related Party Transactions”.

**ELCPs**

_ELCP Points and EI-Points_

In the case of Pegaso and Mercatorum, the ELCP Points and EI Points are the ELCPs where students can request
information regarding the services offered by the relevant education institution. Such ELCPs provide orientation
and support services to students across Italy in order to prepare and enable them to effectively use the online
resources available to them. Such ELCPs also provide technical assistance such as recovery of access credentials
to the platform.

120 Pegaso, Mercatorum and Certipass in some cases each have accreditation agreements with the same ELCP, which therefor performs
services for more than one such institution

148


-----

_EIPASS Points_

In respect of Certipass, of the approximately 1,300 EIPASS Points, indicatively:

    - 510 are “Business Centers” such as training centers;

    - 350 are “Academies” based in state educational institutions;

    - 33 are “Master Centers” such as second-level centers that can affiliate with other Business Centers; and

    - 15 are “Partner Centers” such as third-level centers that can affiliate with both Business Centers and
Master Centers.

The centers directly affiliated with Academies, Master Centers and Partner Centers, and which therefore have an
indirect relationship with Certipass, total about 360.

Multiversity’s objective is to enlarge the network with new types of centers including, for example, universities.
The ELCPs are located on the premises owned and controlled by third-party service providers that have entered
into accreditation agreements with the relevant institution. See “Material Contracts—Accreditation agreements
_for ELCPs.” Such third parties include language centers, basic IT course providers, education facilities,_
municipalities and centers to help prepare for traditional university admission tests. Prior to the execution of each
accreditation agreement, each center is assessed by the relevant institution as being a qualified center for carrying
out teaching, education and training projects, in line with that institution’s objectives.

_Examination Centers_

Exams usually take place at the central examination headquarters of Pegaso in San Giorgio a Cremano, however,
upon payment of the alternative exam location fee (detailed above under “Offering—Ancillary Fees and
_Services”), students may choose to take their exams at one of Pegaso’s other examination centers._

As regards Mercatorum, oral examinations are held in Rome at the headquarters of Unioncamere, whereas
written examinations are held across several large Italian cities at the headquarters of the local Chambers of
Commerce. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and a state of emergency being declared across the
country, exams are being taken exclusively online. However, unless the state of emergency is extended and
national regulations are not amended in order to permit online examinations on a regular basis, on premise
examinations are currently expected to resume after December 31, 2021.

_Center location mapping_

The below graph illustrates the geographic distribution of the various learning and examination centers across the
Italian territory. As is shown, these are more highly concentrated in the southern part of the country.

Multiversity’s IT staff, with no outsourcing to third parties. Multiversity has a central database that collects all
the multimedia content of the lessons, which can be used by other Multiversity educational institutions or by
external partners in accordance with the commercial partnership agreements in place. All the post-production is
done in Naples at Multiversity’s business center. Pegaso and Mercatorum’s employment contracts provide that
all intellectual property rights over such materials are the property of the relevant institution, including following
the termination of the employment relationship.

**Material Contracts**

**_Accreditation agreements for ELCPs_**

As at September 30, 2021, there are approximately 3,000 accreditation agreements (each, an “Accreditation
**Agreement”) in place between the institutions of Multiversity and the entities accredited as ELCPs across the**
Italian territory.

_ELCP Points and EI-Points_

Generally, each Accreditation Agreement in respect of Pegaso’s ELCP Points and Mercatorum’s EI-Points has a
duration of 36 months from the date of its execution. Each entity accredited as an ELCP Point or EI-Point is
required to meet and maintain certain standards including in relation to physical storage, technological
equipment, minimum number of employees, etc.

Each ELCP Point and EI-Point is remunerated by way of a contribution of up to (i) 20% of the tuition fees paid
by each student enrolled in undergraduate degree courses, excluding any ancillary fees, and which benefits from
the orientation services provided by the relevant ELCP Point and EI-Point, and (ii) 25% of the tuition fees paid
by each student enrolled in postgraduate or post-diploma master’s or training courses and which benefits from
the orientation services provided by the relevant ELCP Point or EI-Point. There is no obligation for ELCP Points
or EI-Points to enroll or to recruit students.

_EIPASS Points_

With regard to Certipass’ EIPASS Points, the terms of the relevant accreditation agreement have an initial
duration of two years. Pursuant to the relevant agreement, the EIPASS Point acquires a package of EI cards at
wholesale price and agrees to resell them to customers at the retail price detailed in the contract All agreements
confer the right on the relevant center to promote and disseminate the programs, EIPASS certifications and
services provided by Certipass itself, and the authorization to represent a Certipass exam physical venue.
Certipass agrees to provide to each EIPASS Point the necessary know-how and technical resources in order for it
to offer Certipass services, and also provides it with technical support and assistance as well as access to its
platform. The relevant EIPASS Center can apply for Ei cards, online courses, credits, and/or the qualification of a

150


-----

new supervisor and/or trainer through the DIDASKO platform and undertakes to resell them at the minimum
prices indicated in the reference price list attached to the agreement. The commercial terms of each type of
contract are summarised below:

- Business contract: provides the center with an activation kit composed of 30 “pocket skills” courses, for an
activation price of € 1,727;

- Master contract: provides the center with an activation kit composed of 300 Ei cards, for an activation price
of €16,770. The EIPASS Point undertakes to activate a minimum of five EIPASS Point affiliates within the
first year of the agreement and at all times to maintain such number of affiliates for the duration of
agreement (alternatively the center will become a Business EIPASS Center);

- Partner contract: provides the center with an activation kit composed of 300 Ei cards, 200 online course and
60 loyalty promotional credits, for an activation price of €24,400. The EIPASS Point undertakes to activate
a minimum of 20 affiliated EIPASS Point within the first year of the agreement and at all times to maintain
such number of affiliates for the duration of agreement. Should it fail to activate the 20 affiliated EIPASS
Points indicated above, the EIPASS Point undertakes to purchase 2,500 Ei cards for the second year of
activity (alternatively the center will become a Master EIPASS Center).

_Commercial agreements securing captive customers_

Pegaso and Mercatorum together have over 1,500 agreements in place with associations of public bodies, trade
unions, municipalities, cultural associations, private companies and sports associations for, inter alia, employee
training and which provide for the application of preferential rates for their employees. Partners’ employees are
incentivized to attend these courses in order to accelerate their career paths or to comply with requirements of
regulators or employers. As such, this market is captive in nature and exposes Pegaso and Mercatorum to a large
potential customer base for its entire service offering.

The vast majority of such agreements are Business-to-Customer and apply directly to students. Preferential rates are
applicable upon verification at the time of enrollment that the student is entitled to benefit from the preferential rates
pursuant to the relevant agreement. The terms of such agreements are negotiated on a case by case basis with each
partner and therefore vary (see “—Preferential and corporate rates” above), however most provide for a reduction
of the full annual degree course tuition fee of €3,000 to €2,000. These rates may apply to specific degree, master’s
or higher education courses, and in some cases may also apply to certain categories of students—for example, new
graduates or pregnant women, in order to render the course offering more attractive to such groups. For courses that
last more than one year, the preferential tuition fee will apply for each year of the course.

_Partnerships_

Multiversity has entered into collaboration agreements with approximately 19 partners for the purposes of
creating and offering highly specialized courses for professionals in areas such as sustainability and the
environment, media and communications, corporate social responsibility and smart mobility. Examples of such

Proprietary title of the course materials used for the specialized courses developed as a result of the collaboration,
as well the remuneration, if any, offered to the relevant partner for their collaboration on the relevant project, is
agreed with the relevant partner on a case by case basis.

_Cooperation agreements with international institutions_

In order to promote internationalization in the fields of research, teaching and learning, every year Pegaso enters
into cooperation agreements with universities, including in connection with the Erasmus + Program, from all
over the world and actively participates in prestigious international networks.

Such agreements with international universities are made for a variety of purposes, including joint scientific
projects, exchange of materials and publications, creation of new courses of study, organization of conferences,
seminars and cultural initiatives.

Pegaso currently has 84 such agreements in place with higher education institutions in 32 countries (excluding
Italy).

_Material investments and financing arrangements_

On July 12, 2021, Pegaso invested €20 million in a medium/high risk investment portfolio managed by Banca
Generali S.p.A.

For a description of any material financing arrangements, see “—Description of certain Financing
_Arrangements.”_

**Sustainability**

**_Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”)_**

Achieving inclusive and quality education for all people reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most
powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development. The SDGs initiative established by the UN aims to
provide equal access to affordable vocational training, eliminate gender and wealth disparities and achieve
universal access to a quality higher education by 2030.

In line with the SDGs, Multiversity remains loyal to its commitment to ensure an inclusive and fair quality
education, to promote opportunities of continuous learning for everyone and a sustainable and inclusive
economic growth, facilitating access to honourable job opportunities for everyone. In this context the online
education has no geographical barriers, flexible and democratic approach and can play a relevant role to attain
some of the main goals of the 2030 SDG agenda.

**Insurance**

Multiversity maintains insurance cover in respect of various insurable risks under a range of insurance policies,
including in particular the civil liabilities of its directors and officers, members of its management and
supervisory bodies.

Mercatorum also maintains existing insurance policies covering fire risks and theft risks, as well as damage
caused to third parties and damage caused to Mercatorum’s employees.

Pegaso also maintain existing insurance policies covering damages to third parties and damage caused to
Pegaso’s employees.

**Litigation and legal, tax and administrative proceedings**

**_General_**

From time to time, Multiversity is subject to legal or administrative proceedings or claims arising in the ordinary
course of our business, including claims from employees and former students.

The provisions made for disputes in Multiversity’s consolidated financial statements for the six months ended
June 30, 2021 is equal to €90,349, which includes the risk of loss of ongoing disputes. Such amount has been
allocated on the basis of the merits of the relevant case, as advised by counsel.

_Administrative proceedings_

On May 29, 2020, Pegaso received a note issued by the MIUR and including the National University Council’s
(Consiglio Universitario Nazionale) negative opinion on the proposed amendment of Pegaso’s university internal
regulations in order to allow examinations to take place online. In this respect, Pegaso is petitioning for the
annulment of the note issued by MIUR before the Administrative Court (TAR) of Latium. On May 17, 2021, the
Administrative Court (TAR) of Lazio with decision no. 5797 rejected Pegaso’s petition, stating that the
possibility for students to take examinations online has been allowed only on an exceptional basis, due to the
COVID-19 state of emergency. Pegaso intends to appeal against the decision of the Administrative Court (TAR)
of Lazio within the required timeframe. As noted above, online exams have only been introduced following the
COVID-19 pandemic by all universities; other than in the recently declared state of emergency, exams have
always taken place physically also for online universities.

_Tax audit by the Italian revenue agency_

On November 20, 2019, a tax audit was commenced by the Italian revenue agency concerning (i) the
non-commercial nature of Pegaso in the years preceding its transformation into a limited company (a concern
that should be overruled by the Provision Of Authentic Interpretation; see “Regulation—Transformation of
_Pegaso into a private corporation”); (ii) the VAT treatment applicable to the promotion and support contract_
between Pegaso and Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. resolved on 31 December 2019 and (iii) the tax
treatment of certain donations made by Pegaso in the 2015 and 2016 financial years in favour of two foundations.
The revenue agency’s investigation and document acquisition activities are in progress and, with the support of
Pegaso’s tax advisors, Pegaso is promptly responding to the requests and questions raised by promptly providing
the agency with legal and tax reports on the main issues identified by it. As at the date hereof, the tax audit has
not been concluded and no report of findings has been drawn up yet by the Italian revenue agency.

Other than as stated above, Multiversity is not currently subject to any material legal, governmental, tax or
arbitration proceedings that it believes could reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The outcome of legal
proceedings, however, can be difficult to predict with certainty, and Multiversity can offer no assurances in this
regard.

**REGULATION**

The following provides a brief description of the primary regulations that govern the activities carried out by
Multiversity in Italy. Although the following brief description contains the principal information concerning such
regulations that are considered material by the Issuer in the context of the issue of the Notes, it is not an
exhaustive account of all applicable laws and regulations. References and discussions to laws, treaties,
regulations and other administrative and regulatory documents are entirely qualified by the full text of such laws,
treaties, regulations and other administrative and regulatory documents themselves. In addition, prospective
investors and/or their advisers should make their own full analysis of the legislation and regulations which apply
in the other countries where Multiversity operates and of the impact they may have on an investment in the Notes
and should not rely on the content of the following paragraphs only. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Multiversity’s Business and Industry”_

**Regulation**

The implementation of national regulations on online universities was encouraged at European level with the
European Resolution 2001/C 204/02) of 13 July 2001 issued by the European Council on e-Learning. This
Resolution invited both Members State and the European Commission to consider adopting a series of actions
aimed at implementing and strengthening the e-Learning system in the educational sector, as well as to seek new
learning methods and approaches, and promote virtual mobility and transnational campus projects.

The European Parliament and the European Council later, pursuant to Decision No. 2318/2003/CE of
5 December 2003 aimed to support the initiatives of the EU Member States in the field of distance learning, with
the effective integration of information and communications technologies (“ICT”) systems in education and
training, prioritizing the university as a sector of focus.

Following a proposal made by the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (“ENQA”)
in cooperation with the European Students’ Union (“ESU”), the Ministers responsible for higher education
adopted the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (“EHEA”)
in 2005 and revised the standards in May 2015 (the “2015 ESG”). The 2015 ESG are a set of standards and
guidelines for internal and external assurance of quality in higher education and are focused on ensuring the
quality of learning and teaching in higher education, including learning and appropriate links with research and
innovation.

In this respect, the purposes of the 2015 ESG are to:

(i) improve the educational offering for EHEA students;

(ii) help higher education institutions manage and improve their quality and thereby justify their autonomy;

(iii) provide for work carried out by quality assurance agencies; and

(iv) make external quality assurance more transparent and easier to understand by all stakeholders.

**_The Regulatory Context of Online Universities_**

Online universities (“Università telematiche”) began in Italy after Article 26 of Law no. 289 of 27 December
2002 entered into force, as implemented by the Ministerial Decree 17 April 2003, issued by MIUR and the Italian
Ministry for Innovation and Technologies (“Ministero per l’Innovazione e le Tecnologie”), the so-called
“Moratti-Stanca” Decree.

To acquire the relevant authorisation, online universities shall:

- implement a flexible organisational structure allowing the use of different technologies to properly manage
different activities;

- promote a consistent and teaching-tailored integration of teaching support services;

- ensure the selection, planning and design of adequate e-learning resources for each coursework;

- ensure adequate resources exist for the administration and management of disseminating teaching resources,
including through the offer of articulate tailored teletutoring service; and

- ensure adequate procedures for knowledge assessment; provide for research and development of innovative
e-learning systems capable of supporting the dissemination of multimedia data linked to the range of
learning products offered.

154


-----

Since 2004, 11 online universities have been established and obtained the relevant authorisation
(“accreditamento”) with the MIUR, before a ban was imposed on the establishment of new online universities
(most recently pursuant to Decree 289, which extended the ban to the period 2021-2023).

On October 14, 2021, the new Ministerial Decree regarding the self-evaluation, evaluation, initial and periodic
accreditation of study centers and courses (“DM 2021”) issued by the MIUR was registered in the official
Register of Decrees. Such decree, among other things and in line with industry guidelines, updates the criteria for
the allocation of academic staff by degree program. The operational aspects and terms of implementation of DM
2021 will be defined by means of a special Decree - as yet unissued. Once in force, when published in the Italian
official gazette, DM 2021 will replace Decree 6 as of the 2022/2023 academic year. All (traditional and online)
universities will have approximately five years from the 2020/2021 academic year to gradually implement the
new measures.

The impact of DM 2021 on the Group’s operations and financial performance will be determined once the final
operational aspects and terms will be defined, and will lead to a progressive increase of the teaching cost base
over 5 years and eventually may lead to improving the quality and reputation of the academics in the sector. See
further “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Business and Industry—Any termination, suspension,
_revocation or non-renewal of any of Multiversity’s licenses and authorisations could result in the temporary or_
_permanent cessation of the activities being conducted pursuant to such license and/or authorisation, impact its_
_ability to enroll new students, adversely affect Multiversity’s reputation or cause it to incur unanticipated costs._
_Any of the circumstances described above are likely to have a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business,_
_financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Regulatory changes and investigations may be driven by_
_political and public opinion affecting providers of higher education.”_

_Courses that can be provided by online universities_

Pursuant to Decree 289, online universities are allowed to provide:

- distance learning courses, where over two thirds of the educational activities are delivered at a distance; and

- distance learning courses provided entirely at distance, where all the educational activities are delivered at a
distance, save for exams and discussions relating to final tests, which are taken in person.

Online universities cannot therefore setup classes for courses for which only a mixed mode of delivery is
envisaged (i.e. when distance learning does not exceed two thirds of all educational activities) and cannot set up
courses in the Medicine, Dentistry and Health Professions. However, online universities are allowed to offer
courses in a mixed mode of delivery by pairing with traditional universities or highly specialised research
laboratories[121].

_Academic degrees that can be granted by online universities_

Pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 2 of the “Moratti-Stanca” Decree, online universities can issue the following
academic diplomas and decrees as prescribed by Article 3 of the MIUR Decree No. 270 of 22 October 2004:

- Degree (“Laurea”);

- Master’s Degree (as defined by Ministerial Decree 270/2004, which updated the Ministerial Decree No. 509
of 3 November 1999) (“Laurea specialistica”);

- Specialization Diploma (“Diploma di specializzazione”);

- Ph.D. (“Dottorato di ricerca”); and

- first-and second-level master study programmes.

In addition, online universities can confer 24 CFUs and other qualifying titles.

However, online universities cannot:

- grant academic degrees in courses relating to health professions; or

- establish professionally oriented degree courses[122] as defined in Article 8, paragraph 2 of Ministerial Decree
No. 987 of 12 December 2016 and in Ministerial Decree No. 446 of 12 August 2020.

121 Source: CUN opinion dated 28 September 2016 (https://www.cun.it/uploads/6359/Parere_28_09_2016.pdf?v=)

122 Professionally oriented degree programs are degree programs that include laboratory activities for at least 48 CFU alongside another
48 CFU for internship-related activities.

_The ANVUR “Periodic Accreditation Process”_

After obtaining the initial authorisation, online universities need to undergo a “Periodic accreditation process”
(the “Periodic Accreditation Process”) conducted by ANVUR.

The Periodic Accreditation Process consists of a verification by ANVUR, using remote documentary review
combined with on-site visits, to confirm that the requirements necessary for the initial accreditation of the online
university still remain effective as well as to confirm that the online universities provide quality, efficient and
effective educational activities. The verification process takes into consideration:

- periodic reports online universities prepare regarding their compliance, on an ongoing basis, with the
requirements that led to their initial accreditation[123]. The information to be included in such reports is listed
in Annex E of Ministerial Decree no. 6 of 7 January 2019 (“Decree 6”); and

- the “Indicators of Quality Assurance” in Annex C of Decree 6.

The “Indicators of Quality Assurance” are specified in the guidelines issued by ANVUR pursuant to the 2015
ESG and are aimed at confirming compliance with the following requirements:

- _R1 Requirement: vision, strategies and policies of the university relating to the quality of teaching and_
research;

- _R1T Requirement for on-line universities: methods of delivery for distance learning and related_
technological equipment required and used;

- _R2 Requirement: effectiveness of university policies for quality assurance (“AQ”);_

- _R3 Requirement: quality of educational courses; and_

- _Requirement 4: quality of research and third mission._

Further technical requirements for periodic accreditation of remote educational courses are envisaged, including:

- planning and organisation of teachers and tutors;

- teaching interaction and formative assessments for telematics courses;

- staff qualification and provision of teaching materials for telematics courses;

- assessment of student learning outcomes;

- system integration; and

- quality of teaching interaction.

Pursuant to the combined provisions of Article 3 and Article 6 of Decree 6, for the purpose of the Periodic
Accreditation Process, ANVUR shall also take into account the following criteria, separate and in addition to
those outlined in Annex C:

- the annual report, prepared by the university’s Evaluation Team (“Nucleo di Valutazione”), concerning the
outcomes from their ongoing monitoring and quality control of teaching procedures and research; and

- evaluation of information outlined in the “Unique Annual Form” (“Schede Uniche Annuali”) relating to
courses and research activities.

Thus, based on the above-mentioned criteria, ANVUR shall assess the degree of satisfaction of the Indicators of
Quality Assurance in points 1 to 4 of Annex C to Decree 6. In particular, such requirements implement and
mirror the recommendations envisaged by the 2015 ESG, thereby establishing guidelines for the proper
development of national and institutional quality assurance systems across the EHEA, including cross-border
cooperation.

Pursuant to Article 3 of Decree 6, periodic accreditation of educational premises is accredited to those premises
meeting the requirements for initial accreditation in Annex B (i.e., transparency and integrity) together with the
quality requirements in Annex C, following verification by ANVUR on the basis of outcomes from on-site visits
carried out by the Commission of Experts for Evaluation (“Commissione di Esperti per la Valutazione” or
“Commission of Experts for Evaluation”).

123 Please refer to Article 9, paragraph 2, of Legislative Decree no. 19 of 27 January 2012.

156


-----

Pursuant to Article 5 of Decree 6, periodic accreditation of educational courses is granted to courses meeting the
requirements for initial accreditation together with those set out in Requirement R3 in Annex C; this also takes
into account the periodic evaluation indicators in Article 6. The verification of these requirements is carried out
remotely by ANVUR and is also based on activities of the Evaluation Units (“NUV”).

Depending on the outcome of the verification process, ANVUR grants a score ranging from “A” (“very
positive”) to “E” (“unsatisfactory”). If the Periodic Accreditation Process for an online university is unsuccessful,
the initial authorisation will be revoked using a specific decree of the MIUR.

The Periodic Accreditation Process is carried out every five years on universities, and every three years on
educational courses.

_The ANVUR Research Quality Assessment_

Since its establishment, ANVUR has assessed the quality of the research produced by universities and research
institutions, mainly using peer review, as prescribed by the Presidential Decree no. 76 of 1 February 2010
(Article 3, paragraphs 1(a) and 2(b)).

The Research Quality Assessment (“Valutazione della Qualità della Ricerca” or “VQR”) evaluates the research
conducted by public universities and research institutions; private institutions voluntarily submit their research
for evaluation. The VQR provides an up-to-date assessment of the state of research in various scientific fields, in
order to promote improvements to research quality in the institutions under scrutiny and to allocate performancebased shares of the Ordinary Financing Fund for the Italian university system (“Fondo di Finanziamento
_Ordinario” or “FFO”)._

Currently, VQR is carried out every five years (pursuant to Law No. 232) once a special decree is issued by the
MIUR establishing the guidelines for the VQR and providing the resources necessary to carry out this research
assessment exercise.

The most recently available results are those from the second VQR (covering the years 2011-2014), published in
February 2017. The third VQR (covering the years 2015-2019) was launched with the approval of the Ministerial
Decrees No. 1110 of 29 November 2019 and of 11 August 2020; the findings from this VQR will be made public
in October 2021.

**Pegaso**

Pegaso was established as an online university by a MIUR Decree given on 20 April 2006 and was initially
authorised to setup and provide the following courses:

- Law (Class LMG/01), within the Faculty of Law; and

157


-----

In general, Multiversity’s institutions have a 95% course accreditation rate.

**_Results of the ANVUR Periodic Authorisation Process_**

During the last Periodic Authorisation Process (concluded with MIUR Decree of 25 February 2019), Pegaso
obtained the result “Satisfactory” based on a score of 5.55[128] (i.e. level “C-Tel” under paragraph 3 of Article 3 of
Decree 6).

The evaluation process lasted around 8 months. In addition to the university-wide QA system, four courses (Civil
Engineering, Exercise Sciences, Economic Science and Law) and two faculties (Law and Human Sciences) were
assessed. The final report of the Commission of Experts for Evaluation was submitted to ANVUR on 30 April
2018.

**Mercatorum**

Mercatorum was established as an online university by MIUR Decree on 10 May 2006.

**_Results of the ANVUR Periodic Authorisation Process_**

During the last Periodic Authorisation Process, Mercatorum obtained a 5.51 rating.

Nucleus is working on monitoring the criticisms and presenting ANVUR with a report to objectively asset out
how the criticisms will be addressed.

The evaluation process lasted around 8 months. In addition to the university-wide QA system, all three courses
(Tourism Sciences, Business Management and Management) and the Economics faculty were assessed. The final
report of the Commission of Experts for Evaluation was submitted to ANVUR on 22 February 2018.

Mercatorum obtained positive evaluations of:

- the adequacy of teaching and research policies;

- planning of courses of study and updates of the same;

- establishing an internal research register; and

- its strategy for the third mission.

_Establishment of Pegaso and Mercatorum_

According to their respective by-laws, both Pegaso and Mercatorum qualify as private entities pursuant to Article
1, para. 2 of the Royal Decree No. 1592/1933, having legal personality and, in the case of Mercatorum, with the
aim of pursuing public purposes. As for all the Italian universities, under article 33 of the Constitution of the
Republic of Italy, Pegaso and Mercatorum have didactic, organizational, administrative, financial and
disciplinary autonomy.

To pursue their respective institutional purposes, Pegaso and Mercatorum have, according to Article 26 of Law
No. 289/2002 and ministerial decree of April 17, 2003, the primary task of carrying out, in addition to research
and study activities, training activities through the use of distance learning methodologies with particular regard
to e-learning applications.

Pegaso is promoted and supported by Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. whereas Mercatorum is promoted and
supported by the company Unimercatorum S.r.l., (each a “Promoter”). Pursuant to the by-laws of each of Pegaso
and Mercatorum and of each Promoter, each institution’s Promoter shall ensure the pursuit of the relevant
university’s institutional objectives and provide the means and any specific services as may be necessary,
indispensable and instrumental, also through the provision of funding and/or arrangements with suppliers, for the
functioning and pursuit of the relevant university’s institutional purposes.

The by-laws also provide that each university may also regulate its relationship with its Promoter by means of a
specific agreement in order to pursue its institutional purpose and the related means and specific services as may
be necessary, indispensable or instrumental, for its functioning and the pursuit of its institutional purposes.
Pegaso and Mercatorum each have in place specific agreements/arrangements with their respective Promoters
that serve to guarantee the financial capability of the universities and, as a consequence, ensure the continuity of
their didactic activities. Since Mercatorum recorded a net profit for the 2020 financial year, thereby concluding it
with a positive net equity and achieving full economic and financial balance, it recognized the amount required to
be calculated under the promotion and support agreement to the Promoter in the profit and loss statement. The

contribution is accounted as a cost in Mercatorum and as income in Unimercatorum s.r.l., with no effect at
consolidation level. As a consequence, the income of Mercatorum remains within the Group.

Further to the reorganization in 2019, Pegaso was transformed into a private corporation (see “—Transformation
_of Pegaso into a private corporation” below), whereas Mercatorum remains a non-commercial entity._

_Transformation of Pegaso into a private corporation_

On November 19, 2018, Pegaso’s board of directors resolved upon the transformation of Pegaso, as a private
online university, into a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) named “Università
Telematica Pegaso S.r.l.”, and the relevant amendments to the by-laws in order to effect such change.

With its note No. 5726 of November 20, 2018, Pegaso notified the MIUR of the abovementioned resolution, in
order to obtain its favourable opinion. Given the complexity of such decision, the MIUR, with its note No. 645 of
January 14, 2019, informed Pegaso that the approval of the transformation should have been subject to the prior
opinion of the Council of State (i.e. the Supreme Administrative Court).

In the plenary assembly (adunanza plenaria) of May 9, 2019, the Council of State granted its favourable opinion
confirming that the current legislation on universities set out under the Royal Decree No. 1592/1933 (as
subsequently amended) and Law non-commercial entities into private corporations. However, in the absence of a
specific regulatory framework on the implementation of the corporate models with regard to universities, the
Council of State however, required an intervention by the Italian Legislator aimed at realigning and reorganising
the sector following and as a result of the introduction of the new possible corporation structure of private
universities, as recognized by the Decision of the Council of State which was not in this orientation initially
issued. A partial modification was made with the inclusion for the first time in the 2020 Italian Budget Law
(Legge di Bilancio 2020), in article 1, paragraph 721, concerning the treatment of non-public universities for the
purposes of income taxes, of a provision for legally recognized free non-public universities not constituted in the
legal form of commercial companies. Postulating, therefore, already de facto existence. In light of this, the
Council of State recommended that the Government should further evaluate whether to propose legislative
reforms before the Parliament, also to the consolidated text referred to in Royal Decree no. 1592/1933, in order
update the regulatory framework and adapt it better to the transformation of open private universities into private
corporations. See further “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Business and Industry—Multiversity is
_subject to various licensing and accreditation requirements in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and its_
_failure to comply with these requirements could expose Multiversity to financial losses and lead to loss of_
_qualified personnel and students.”_

Following the favourable opinion of the Council of State, the MIUR, with note No. 10282 of June 19, 2019
granted its favourable opinion on said transformation and gave its clearance to the consequential amendment of
the Pegaso’s by-laws.

On June 25, 2019, the procedure for the transformation was positively concluded with the registration of Pegaso
in the companies register (registro delle imprese) as a “limited liability company” and the publication in the
Official Gazette of the Italian Republic of the new Pegaso by-laws.

With reference to the tax regime applicable to Pegaso before its transformation into a private corporation, it has
to be noted that the Italian Legislator—in order to clarify the fiscal nature of “free” (or non-State) universities
established by private initiatives—enacted a special provision of authentic interpretation having retroactive
effect—Article 1, paragraph 721, Law 27 December 2019, n. 160 (hereinafter, the “Provision Of Authentic
**Interpretation”)—according to which, only for income tax purposes, the educational activity carried out by the**
said free universities shall be considered as exercise of State functions by a public body and, therefore, not
relevant (i.e. non-commercial activity) for Italian corporate income tax purposes according to Article 74, para. 2,
let. a of the Presidential Decree 22 December 1986, No. 917. The above with the consequence that the concern of
the Italian revenue agency (in the context tax audit commenced on November 20, 2019—see “Business—
_Litigation and legal, tax and administrative proceedings”) regarding the non-commercial nature of Pegaso in the_
years preceding its transformation should not be grounded as the issue has been expressly addressed by the
Provision Of Authentic Interpretation.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following is a summary of the material terms of the Group’s principal financing arrangements in addition to_
_the Indenture after giving effect to the Transactions. The following summaries do not purport to describe all of_
_the applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the_
_actual agreements. You should refer to the actual agreements for further details, copies of which are available_
_upon request._

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

Capitalized terms used in this section shall have the meanings given to them in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement unless otherwise defined.

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the transaction, the Issuer (as company and original borrower), certain affiliates of the Initial
Purchasers and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as facility agent (the “Agent”) and Security Agent, among
others, have entered into or will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of
€100 million on a committed basis. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future
borrower (subject to certain exceptions) under the Revolving Credit Facility in euro, US dollars, pound Sterling
or certain other currencies (if agreed) by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of Letters of Credit and by way
of Ancillary Facilities.

Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time. Borrowings are
available for, among other things, general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group and, without
prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, to fund (i) any acquisition (including the Acquisition), investment,
joint venture, restructuring, reorganization or capital expenditure; (ii) the payment of any stamp, registration and
other taxes arising and/or incurred in connection with the Acquisition and/or any transaction relating thereto;
(iii) the rolling over, repayment, financing, refinancing, backstopping, discharge and/or acquisition of existing
indebtedness and/or any existing ancillary facilities, letters of credit or bank guarantees of the Group or the
Target Group or providing cash collateral or other credit support for the same and any breakage costs, any
redemption premium and any other fees, costs and expenses financing costs relating to the same (provided that,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Revolving Credit Facility shall not be utilised for the purposes of repayment of
principal with respect to, or redemption or defeasance of, the Senior Secured Notes); (iii) bridging Target Group
cash at the Closing Date; (iv) the payment of any original issue discount, fees, costs (including Acquisition
Costs) and expenses and stamp, registration and other taxes; (v) any purchase price, closing or other adjustments
or other payments in connection with any acquisition (including the Acquisition); and/or (vi) any other payments,
adjustments, purposes or transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, the Tax Structure
Memorandum and/or the Funds Flow Statement.

**_Additional Facilities_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contemplates the incurrence of additional uncommitted revolving
facilities, provided that the underlying incurrence of such debt is permitted by the covenant described in
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”, whether as a new facility and/or as
an additional tranche of any existing facility and/or by increasing the commitments under an existing facility.
Such additional facilities may be secured and may rank pari passu with, or subordinated to, the Revolving Credit
Facility, provided that any such additional facility that is to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility
shall be incurred pursuant to the “credit facilities” basket for super senior indebtedness.

The availability, maturity, pricing and other terms of any additional facility will be those agreed between the
Issuer and the relevant lenders of that additional facility, provided that any such additional facility that is to rank
_pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility shall have a final maturity date which is no earlier than the_
Revolving Credit Facility’s termination date.

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility (other than any Rollover Utilisation or a Renewal Request made available
thereunder) may, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized from time to time until
the date falling one month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. Any Rollover Utilisation or
a Renewal Request may, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized from time to
time until to (and including) the Termination Date for the Revolving Credit Facility.

163


-----

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

The Issuer is the original borrower and original guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility. A mechanism is
included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to enable certain of its subsidiaries to accede as additional
borrowers or additional guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain conditions. The
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires that in the future each member of the Group which is or
becomes a Material Company or is otherwise required to satisfy the Guarantor Coverage Test (as defined below)
becomes an additional guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (subject to Agreed Security
Principles and guarantee limitations included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

**_Maturity and Repayment Requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility matures on or about April, 2028. Each advance will be repaid on the last day of the
interest period relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All
outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date
for the Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit
Facility may be re-borrowed during its availability period, subject to certain conditions. The termination date for
any additional facility is the date agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders (provided that, if the
additional facility ranks pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility, the termination date cannot be earlier than
the termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility).

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at rates per annum equal to the aggregate of the
applicable margin plus (a) in relation to advances in euro, EURIBOR (subject to a zero floor), (b) in relation to
advances in sterling, a compound reference rate based on SONIA (subject to a daily rate zero floor) or (c) in
relation to advances in US dollars, LIBOR (until agreed otherwise between the Issuer and the relevant US dollar
lenders upon the US dollar LIBOR cessation date) (subject to a zero floor). The initial margin under the
Revolving Credit Facility will be 3.00% per annum. Beginning on the date which falls six months from closing
and provided that no Event of Default relating to non-payment of principal or interest, insolvency or failure to
deliver a compliance certificate under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement such that the margin cannot be
determined has occurred and is continuing, the margin on the loans will be reduced if certain total net leverage
ratios (which are to be calculated substantially consistently with the calculations set forth in the Indenture, as
described in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) are met.

If closing occurs, a commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the
Revolving Credit Facility from (and including) closing to (and including) the date the Revolving Credit Facility
is drawn and/or cancelled in full at the rate of 30% of the then applicable margin for the Revolving Credit
Facility. The commitment fee will be payable quarterly in arrear, on the last day of the availability period of the
Revolving Credit Facility and (in respect of any cancellation of commitments) on the date any commitments
under the Revolving Credit Facility are cancelled or on the date on which a lender cancels its commitment.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the Agent and the Security Agent in connection with
the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Guarantees_**

The Issuer has provided a senior guarantee of all amounts payable to the Finance Parties by any of its
subsidiaries which accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional borrowers or additional
guarantors and to the hedging banks under certain secured hedging agreements.

Under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer must ensure that by no later than the earlier of the
date falling 120 days after (and excluding) (a) the effective date of the Post-closing Reorganisation and (b) the
first anniversary of closing (the “First Coverage Test Date”), each Material Company (which definition
includes, among other things, any wholly-owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer incorporated in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction (being Italy) which has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization representing more
than 5% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group) (subject to Agreed Security Principles) accedes to the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as an additional guarantor. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and
certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—_
_Limitations on Granting Security Interests and Guarantees under Italian Law”, if the aggregate of earnings_
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility

164


-----

Agreement is less than 80% of the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the whollyowned members of the Group incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction, the Issuer is also required to ensure that
each other member of the Group as may be necessary to ensure that the Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied
accedes to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as a guarantor.

Furthermore, if on the last day of a fiscal year of the Issuer, the Guarantor Coverage Test is not met and/or each
Material Company is not a guarantor, the Issuer must, within 120 days of receipt by the Agent of the annual
financial statements (commencing with the first set of annual financial statements delivered for the fiscal year
ending at least six months after the First Coverage Test Date), cause sufficient members of the Group to accede
to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional guarantors (subject to agreed security principles and
limitations under applicable laws) to ensure that each Material Company accedes as a guarantor and the
Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied.

**_Security_**

The Notes will benefit from substantially the same security as the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the collateral (whether or not shared with the
holders of the Notes) will be required to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility in priority to the Notes.

Any Material Company or other member of the Group located in a Guarantor Jurisdiction which becomes a
guarantor of the Revolving Credit Facility is required (subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles and certain limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”) to grant_
security over shares in any Material Company that is its wholly-owned subsidiary and (if wholly owned by other
members of the Group) to have its shares (or equivalent ownership interests) secured in favor of the Security
Agent (including on a limited recourse basis if the relevant shareholder is not a guarantor). Security is also to be
granted (subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares in any additional
borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility (including on a limited recourse basis if the relevant shareholder is
not a guarantor). For the avoidance of doubt, no security shall be granted by (or over the quota in or loans made
to) Target or MultiSpA.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, subject to
certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets, and with certain
representations and warranties being repeated, including: (i) status and incorporation; (ii) binding obligations;
(iii) non-conflict with constitutional documents, laws or other obligations; (iv) power and authority; (v) validity and
admissibility in evidence; (vi) ranking and (vii) accuracy of most recent financial statements delivered.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments) that apply to the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants. Set forth below is a brief description of such
covenants, all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge or other qualifications, exceptions
and baskets.

_Affirmative Covenants_

The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information, including annual
audited and quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates; (ii) authorizations, (iii) compliance with
laws; (iv) payment of taxes; (v) maintenance of pari passu ranking of the Revolving Credit Facility;
(vi) maintenance of Guarantor Coverage Test, granting of additional guarantees and security in prescribed
circumstances; (vii) access to books, accounts and records in prescribed circumstances only; (viii) further
assurance provisions and (ix) certain conditions subsequent.

_Negative Covenants_

The negative covenants include restrictions, among others, with respect to deliberately changing the center of
main interest of a borrower or guarantor. Otherwise, the negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement are substantially the same as the negative covenants in the Indenture.

165


-----

**_Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control_**

The Issuer is required to notify the Agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement of a Change of Control,
following which each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is entitled to notify the Issuer
requiring repayment of all outstanding amounts owed to that lender and the cancellation of that lender’s
commitments.

**_Financial Covenants_**

There are no maintenance or springing financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for some of the same events of default, with certain
adjustments, as under the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for certain customary events
of default, all of which are subject to customary materiality and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or
grace periods, as appropriate, including: (i) representations or warranties found to be untrue or misleading in any
material respect, which materially and adversely affects the interest of the lenders (taken as a whole) under the
Finance Documents, when made or deemed made subject to a 60-day grace period; (ii) unlawfulness and
invalidity which materially and adversely affects the interest of the lenders (taken as a whole) under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to a 60-day grace period; (iii) failure by a Shareholder Creditor to
comply with a material term of the Intercreditor Agreement which materially and adversely affects the interest of
the lenders (taken as a whole) under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to a 60-day grace period;
and (iv) repudiation and rescission which materially and adversely affects the interest of the lenders (taken as a
whole) under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to a 60-day grace period.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The Issuer, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “RCF Lenders”), each obligor in
respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Security Agent and the Subordinated Creditors (as that term is
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), among others, have entered into or will enter into an intercreditor
agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) to which the Trustee shall accede on or around the Issue Date.
Certain hedging providers and certain subsidiaries of the Issuer (such subsidiaries together with the Issuer, the
“Debtors”) may accede in the future. By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have
agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and shall be deemed to have
authorized the Trustee to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement and which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes following the Trustee’s
accession to the Intercreditor Agreement on the Issue Date. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its
entirety. As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the description that
follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the
Debtors, the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors, when payments can be made in respect of
debt of the Debtors, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that indebtedness, the terms pursuant to
which certain of that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and
turnover provisions. Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict
between the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. Capitalized terms used below shall have the meanings given to them
in the Intercreditor Agreement unless otherwise defined.

**_Overview_**

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Group (as defined below);

- the relative ranking of certain security granted by certain members of the Group and the Third Party
Security Provider;

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Group;

- when enforcement action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions)
(“Enforcement Action”) can be taken in respect of the Transaction Security (as defined below);

166


-----

- provisions relating to the making of any acceleration or demand for payment in respect of the Notes and any
Senior Notes;

- the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

- the requirement to turn over amounts received from enforcement of the Transaction Security;

- when the Transaction Security and any guarantee(s) issued by certain Obligors will be released to permit an
enforcement sale;

- the circumstances in which creditors’ claims (including noteholders’ claims against the Issuer and/or any
Senior Notes Issuer (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)) might be required to be transferred to third
parties or released to assist in enforcement; and

- the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security and other amounts
received by the Security Agent.

**_Parties_**

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the principal parties to the Intercreditor Agreement will be: (i) Paganini
Investments S.à r.l. as Original Shareholder Creditor and Original Third Party Security Provider, (ii) the Issuer
(as Original Debtor and Original Intra-Group Lender), (iii) the agent for the finance parties under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement (the “RCF Agent”), (iv) the RCF Lenders, and (v) the Security Agent.

The “Super Senior Creditors” include the RCF Lenders and the RCF Agent (and, upon accession, any future
lenders (“Credit Facility Lenders”) in respect of future credit facilities which rank super senior as to the
application of proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security (“Credit Facilities”)) together with,
upon accession, the Priority Hedge Counterparties (as defined below). The “Senior Secured Creditors” include
the holders of the Notes, the Trustee together with, upon accession, the Non-Priority Hedge Counterparties (as
defined below), the Future Pari Passu Creditors (as defined below) and the Cash Management Facility Creditors
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)[130]. The “Senior Creditors” include, upon accession, any Senior
Notes Creditors and the Future Senior Creditors (as defined below).

The Intercreditor Agreement therefore allows for accession by certain future creditors in order to share (to the
extent set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) in the relevant security, including (i) hedge counterparties pursuant
to hedging agreements which are secured on a super senior basis with (among other liabilities) the Revolving
Credit Facility (the “Priority Hedging Agreements” and the providers thereof the “Priority Hedge
**Counterparties”), (ii) hedge counterparties pursuant to hedging agreements which are secured on a pari passu**
basis with (with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of security (among other liabilities)) the Notes (the
“Non-Priority Hedging Agreements” and the providers thereof, the “Non-Priority Hedge Counterparties”
and together with the Priority Hedge Counterparties, the “Hedge Counterparties”), (iii) creditors of future loan
or bond indebtedness of the Debtors (which is permitted by or not restricted under the terms of the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture and any Senior Notes Indenture (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement), and which is not subordinated in right of payment to the liabilities owed to the Super Senior
Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors) (the “Future Pari Passu Debt”), including any senior secured notes
issued after the Issue Date pursuant to the Indenture (the “Future Pari Passu Creditors”) and (iv) creditors of
future loan or bond indebtedness of the Debtors (which is permitted by or not restricted under the terms of the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture and any Senior Notes Indenture (if any), and which is pari passu with
respect to the proceeds of enforcement of security, and not subordinated in right of payment to, the liabilities
owed to the Senior Creditors) (“Future Senior Debt”), including any senior notes issued after the Issue Date
pursuant to a Senior Notes Indenture (the “Future Senior Creditors”).

130 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Intercreditor Agreement includes a mechanic whereby a Cash Management Facility may be
designated by a debtor as a Credit Facility (and thus giving such Cash Management Facility and relevant Cash Management Facility
Creditors super senior status as to the proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security. Accordingly, certain concepts where
referred to in the Intercreditor Agreement (and hence in this summary) in respect of any such cash management facility may also
constitute more than one defined term used in the Intercreditor Agreement (and hence in this summary) including, without limitation,
Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date and Cash Management Facility Discharge Date) (a “Dual Term Concept”). Where an existence
of a Dual Term Concept in the Intercreditor Agreement would give rise to any inconsistency or ambiguity, or where the two relevant
defined terms cannot co-exist or both be true, when interpreting the Intercreditor Agreement, the relevant defined term corresponding or
relating to Credit Facilities (i.e. Super Senior Liabilities) shall prevail for all purposes.

Neither the Issuer nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (each a member of the “Group”) nor any shareholder of
a member of the Group which is not otherwise party to (1) a document creating security in favor of the Super
Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Creditors or (2) the debt documents thereby secured,
will be party to the Intercreditor Agreement save for (i) any shareholder of the Issuer or any direct or indirect
shareholder of the Issuer which has made a loan to a member of the Group (each a “Shareholder Creditor”) (the
Intercreditor Agreement contains customary subordination provisions and restrictions relating to the receivables
owing from any Senior Notes Issuer or any member of the Group to any Shareholder Creditor (the “Shareholder
**Liabilities”)) (ii) any holding company of the Issuer which is designated a “Parent Borrower” by the Issuer under**
the Intercreditor Agreement (each a “Holdco Lender”) which has made a loan to a the Issuer (the “Holdco
**Liabilities”) and (iii) certain members of the Group that lend to another member of the Group (each an**
“Intragroup Lender”) that will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the loans or indebtedness
owing from such members of the Group to such Intra-Group Lenders in respect of intra-group loans (the “Intra**Group Liabilities”). The Intercreditor Agreement contains subordination provisions relating to any Subordinated**
Liabilities. However, members of the Group will not be prohibited from incurring, amending or making
payments in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities until an acceleration event under the Revolving Credit Facility
or the Indenture is continuing and at any time prior to such acceleration event, such Intra-Group Liabilities may
be converted into equity (subject to certain security being granted where required).

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Indebtedness_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities of the Debtors shall rank in right and priority of payment
in the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

(a) _first, the liabilities owed to the Super Senior Creditors (the “Super Senior Liabilities”), the liabilities owed_
to the Senior Secured Creditors with respect to the Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities”), the
liabilities owed to any Hedge Counterparty (the “Hedging Liabilities”) (to the extent not already included
in the Super Senior Liabilities), the liabilities owed to the Cash Management Facility Creditors (the “Cash
**Management Facility Liabilities”), the liabilities of any Senior Notes Issuer in respect of any Senior Notes**
(the “Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities”), the Future Pari Passu Debt, the Future Senior Debt of any future
issuer of senior debt to the Future Senior Creditors (the “Future Senior Issuer Liabilities”), and certain
customary costs and expenses of the Trustee and any Senior Notes Trustee (the “Trustee Liabilities”) pari
_passu and without any preference between them;_

(b) _second, the guarantee liabilities owed to the Senior Creditors with respect to any Senior Notes (the “Senior_
**Notes Guarantee Liabilities” and, together with any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities, the “Senior Notes**
**Liabilities”), together with any guarantee liabilities owed to any Future Senior Creditor pari passu and**
without any preference between them;

(c) _third, the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Holdco Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between_
them; and

(d) _fourth, the Shareholder Liabilities, pari passu and without any preference between them._

The Intercreditor Agreement contains an acknowledgment by all parties thereto that any Senior Notes Issuer
Liabilities and the Future Senior Issuer Liabilities are senior obligations of the relevant issuer, and provides that
nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall impair the right of the Senior Creditors to institute suit for the
recovery of any payment due by such an issuer in respect of any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities or the Future
Senior Issuer Liabilities (as applicable), but provides that the Senior Creditors shall not, until the Senior Secured
Discharge Date, take any steps to appropriate the assets of such an issuer subject to the Transaction Security in
connection with any Enforcement Action other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Priority of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security provided for the liabilities described in paragraphs (a) and
(b) below (the “Transaction Security”) shall rank and secure these liabilities in the following order (and subject
to the proceeds of such security being distributed in accordance with the Payments Waterfall defined below):

(a) _first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities (to the extent_
not already included in the Super Senior Liabilities), the Cash Management Facility Liabilities, the Future
Pari Passu Debt and the Trustee Liabilities, pari passu and without any preference between them (but only
to the extent that such Transaction Security expressed to secure those liabilities); and

(b) _second, any Senior Notes Liabilities and the Future Senior Debt pari passu and without any preference_
between them (but only to the extent that such Transaction Security is Shared Security (which term shall

168


-----

include, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, certain other security as may be granted in the
future and designated by the Issuer as “Shared Security”)).

The Intercreditor Agreement further provides that any security provided for any Senior Notes only (of which
there is none as at the date of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Issue Date) (the “Senior Notes Only Security”)
shall rank and secure only any Senior Notes Liabilities and the Future Senior Debt, pari passu and without any
preference between them (but only to the extent that such Senior Notes Only Security is expressed to secure such
liabilities).

The Shareholder Liabilities, the Holdco Liabilities and the Intra-Group Liabilities (the “Subordinated
**Liabilities”) shall not be secured by the Transaction Security or any Senior Notes Only Security.**

If security is to be granted for certain future indebtedness (including Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, Cash
Management Facility Liabilities, additional senior secured notes, Future Pari Passu Debt, Future Senior Debt and
any future Senior Notes) (“Future Debt”), to the extent such Future Debt cannot be secured with the agreed
ranking without the existing security first being released, the Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions that
such Future Debt will (to the extent permitted by applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of
additional security documents securing the same assets subject to the relevant security on a second- or
lesser-ranking basis and such Future Debt will nonetheless be deemed and treated for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by such security pari passu with corresponding liabilities which would
otherwise have the same ranking as contemplated above and any amounts to be applied towards such Future Debt
shall be applied accordingly. In the event that it is not possible to permit the recreation of additional security
documents as referred to above, no amendments or release and retaking of security under the existing security
documents shall be permitted without the consent of the required creditors under the documents thereby secured
unless permitted by such documents.

_Payments and Prepayments; Subordination of any Senior Notes_

The Debtors and the Third Party Security Provider may make payments and prepayments in respect of the
Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes at any time in accordance with their terms and may prepay or acquire the
Notes.

Any Senior Notes Issuer may make payments and prepayments in respect of any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities
(including by prepaying or acquiring any Senior Notes) at any time in accordance with the terms of any Senior
Notes Indenture, any Senior Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement provided that such payment is not made from
assets subject to Transaction Security and not financed by a payment from a member of the Group that was
prohibited at such time by any of the Credit Facility Documents, Senior Secured Notes Documents and Future
Pari Passu Debt Documents.

Prior to the discharge of all Senior Secured Liabilities, no Debtor, Third Party Security Provider or other member
of the Group may make payments in respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities without the consent of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors and Majority Senior Secured Creditors except as described in the foregoing paragraph or
as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement including (without limitation and subject to conditions where
applicable) the following:

(1) if:

(a) the payment is of: (i) any of the principal or interest (including capitalized interest) amount of any
Senior Notes Liabilities which is either (1) not prohibited from being paid by the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Cash Management Facility Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Documents
or any Future Pari Passu Debt Document or (2) is paid on or after the final maturity of any Senior
Notes; or (ii) any other amount in respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities which is not an amount of
principal or capitalized interest accrued due and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of any
Senior Notes Documents or a corresponding amount under any Holdco Debt Document (as that term is
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(b) no notice delivered pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement blocking payments in respect
of any Senior Notes Liabilities (a “Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice”) is outstanding; and

(c) no Senior Secured Debt Payment Default (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has
occurred and is continuing; or

(2) certain amounts due to any Senior Notes Trustee for its own account; or

(3) payments of amounts equal to any payment accrued pursuant to any Senior Notes or any Senior Notes
guarantee immediately after the period during which any Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice is outstanding
or a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default ceases to be continuing and which would otherwise have been a
permitted payment pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; or

169


-----

(4) for so long as a Senior Secured Debt Event of Default is continuing certain payments as a result of any
Senior Notes Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged in exchange for the issuance of shares in any
holding company of any Senior Notes Issuer, subject to certain conditions;

(5) certain payments of non-cash interest by way of capitalization;

(6) payments funded with the incurrence of Senior Notes Liabilities;

(7) costs, commissions, taxes, advisory or professional fees, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect of (or
reasonably incidental to) any Senior Notes Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing
requirements under any Senior Notes Documents), subject to certain conditions;

(8) audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes and other proper and incidental expenses required to maintain existence or
any other reasonable and ordinary course administrative and maintenance costs of a Senior Notes Issuer or
its Affiliates;

(9) costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to)
any refinancing of any Senior Notes in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Credit
Facility, the Senior Secured Notes Documents, the Cash Management Facility Documents and any Future
Pari Passu Debt Document, subject to certain conditions;

(10) payments of certain reasonable and customary consent or amendment/waiver fees in connection with
amendments to any Senior Notes Documents;

(11) payments in connection with purchases, repurchases or redemptions of Senior Notes permitted under the
Credit Facility Documents, Cash Management Facility Documents, Senior Secured Notes Documents and
Future Pari Passu Debt Documents; or

(12) payment of any other amount not exceeding €3,500,000 in aggregate in any twelve month period (which
may be carried forward if not used).

Substantially equivalent provisions and restrictions apply in respect of any Future Senior Debt, mutatis mutandis.

Prior to the discharge of all the Senior Secured Debt, if a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default (as that term is
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has occurred and is continuing all payments in respect of any Senior
Notes Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors and certain amounts due to any Senior Notes Trustee for its own account) will be suspended.

In addition, if a Senior Secured Debt Event of Default (other than a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default) (each
a “Senior Secured Default”) has occurred and is continuing and any Senior Notes Trustee has received a Senior
Notes Payment Stop Notice from either the RCF Agent, the Cash Management Facility Agent or the Trustee or
the representative of the Future Pari Passu Debt (the “Relevant Representative”), all payments in respect of any
Senior Notes Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority
Senior Secured Creditors and certain amounts due to any Senior Notes Trustee for its own account) are
suspended until the earliest of:

(a) the date on which there is a waiver, remedy or cure of such Senior Secured Default in accordance with the
relevant finance documents; or

(b) 179 days after the receipt by any Senior Notes Trustee of the Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice;

(c) the repayment and discharge of all obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities;

(d) the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice (and, if
at such time a Senior Secured Default is continuing in relation to the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than
the Senior Secured Liabilities in respect of which the notice was given), the Relevant Representative(s) in
respect of those other Senior Secured Liabilities) notify/ies (amongst others) any Senior Notes Trustee that
the Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice is cancelled;

(e) the date on which the Security Agent or Senior Notes Trustee takes any Enforcement Action against a
member of the Group which it is permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(f) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Default is no longer continuing and if the relevant Senior
Secured Liabilities have been accelerated such acceleration has been rescinded (and if such acceleration
consisted solely of declaring the relevant debt payable on demand, such rescission can be effected by the
relevant majority creditors in respect of the relevant debt); or

(g) if a Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of a Senior Notes Payment
Stop Notice, the date on which the Standstill Period expires,

170


-----

provided that none of the circumstances described in this paragraph, nor those described in the paragraph above
shall prevent any Senior Notes Issuer from making payments in respect of any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities in
accordance with the terms of the relevant documentation from its own assets (excluding at all times any assets
which are subject to Transaction Security) provided that such payment is not financed by a payment to any
Senior Notes Issuer from a member of the Group that was prohibited by then existing (if any) Credit Facility
Documents the Senior Secured Notes Documents and Future Pari Passu Debt Documents.

Unless waived by any Senior Notes Trustee, (a) no new Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be served by a
Relevant Representative unless 360 days have elapsed since the immediately prior Senior Notes Payment Stop
Notice and (b) no Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Secured Debt Event of
Default more than 60 days after the date that the Relevant Representative received notice of that Senior Secured
Default. No Relevant Representative may serve more than one Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice with respect to
the same event or set of circumstances, and no Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a
Senior Secured Event of Default notified to a Relevant Representative at the time at which an earlier Senior
Notes Payment Stop Notice was issued.

If a Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding or the relevant Senior Secured Debt Payment
Default has ceased to be continuing (by being waived by the Relevant Representative or remedied) the relevant
Debtor may then make those payments it would have otherwise been entitled to pay under any Senior Notes and
if it does so promptly any event of default under any Senior Notes caused by such delayed payment shall be
waived and any enforcement notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be
waived. A Senior Secured Debt Payment Default is remedied by the payment of all amounts then due.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by any Senior Notes; Senior Notes Standstill_

Without prejudice to the rights of the Senior Creditors to take Enforcement Action in relation to any Senior Notes
Issuer Liabilities and/or any Senior Notes Only Security, prior to the discharge of all the Senior Secured
Liabilities, neither any Senior Notes Trustee nor the holders of any Senior Notes may take Enforcement Action
with respect to any Senior Notes (including any action against any Senior Notes Issuer or the guarantors of any
Senior Notes (if any)) or direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any
relevant Transaction Security document (including the Shared Security) without the prior consent of or as
required by an Instructing Group (as defined below), except that such restriction will not apply in relation to any
Senior Notes Guarantee Liabilities and Shared Security if (1) an event of default has occurred under any Senior
Notes resulting from failure to pay principal at final maturity or (2):

(a) an event of default under any Senior Notes Indenture is continuing;

(b) the RCF Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities have received notice of the
specified event of default from any Senior Notes Trustee;

(c) a Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

(d) the relevant event of default is continuing at the end of the Standstill Period.

A “Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that any Senior Notes Trustee serves an
enforcement notice on the RCF Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities until the
earliest of:

(a) 179 days after such date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes Enforcement Action (including the enforcement of any
Transaction Security permitted to be enforced under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), provided that
any Senior Notes Trustee and holders of Senior Notes may only take the same Enforcement Action against
the same entity as is taken by the Senior Secured Creditors and may not take any other action against any
other member of the Group;

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of any guarantor of any Senior Notes against whom
Enforcement Action is to be taken; and

(d) the expiration of any other Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the current Standstill
Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or permitted remedy thereof).

If an Event of Default ceases to be continuing then (provided the relevant parties are made aware of such fact)
any relevant enforcement process (including any requirement of consultation relating to enforcement) relying
solely on that Event of Default shall cease to continue.

Substantially similar provisions to those described in this section with respect to any Senior Notes are included in
the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to Future Senior Debt and related Future Senior Creditors.

171


-----

If the Security Agent has notified any Senior Notes Trustee that it is enforcing Transaction Security, no other
Senior Notes Creditor may take any enforcement action against the Third Party Security Provider, that Debtor or
any subsidiary of that Debtor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Transaction Security where
such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be
derived therefrom. If any Senior Notes Creditors are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to
require the enforcement of such Transaction Security, such Enforcement Action must require the realization of
the relevant Security by way of a sale or disposal conducted in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Consultation_

Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction
Security and/or the requesting of a distressed disposal and/or the release or disposal of claims and/or Transaction
Security on a distressed disposal (“Enforcement”), the relevant representative of the Super Senior Liabilities or the
Senior Secured Liabilities (as applicable) shall notify the Security Agent and the creditor representatives for each of
the Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors that the applicable Transaction Security has
become enforceable. As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent
to solicit instructions with respect to the enforcement of the Transaction Security or the taking of any other
Enforcement Action by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following which,
the RCF Agent (acting on the instructions of the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors), the Cash Management
Facility Agent, the representative of any Future Pari Passu Creditors and the Trustee will consult in good faith with
each other and the Security Agent for a period of 15 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or
such shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an
Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy (the “Consultation Period”).

No such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of the
Consultation Period), in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security Enforcement Principles
set forth below (“Qualifying Instructions”) where:

(a) any of the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting any
Senior Notes Issuer, the Issuer, or a borrower or a guarantor or any member (or members) of the Group that
is or are a Significant Subsidiary or a Significant Group (each a “Relevant Company”); or

(b) subject to no instructions having been given by an Instructing Group in the circumstances described below,
the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine in good faith
(and notify each other representative agent of the Super Senior Creditors, each Cash Management Facility,
the Senior Secured Creditors, the Future Pari Passu Creditors and the Security Agent) that any delay caused
by such consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be realized to a level such
that (following application thereof in accordance with the Payment Waterfall described below) the Super
Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full and in this case any instructions will be limited to those
necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors or, as the case may be, the
Super Senior Creditors, on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent
shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

If following the Consultation Period, the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement
the same.

Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes the failure to
give instructions is deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received by the end of the Consultation Period, the
Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security and/
or take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors, in each case provided such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all
instructions received by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be
deemed revoked.

If the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably)
consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the security in a manner which is not consistent with the Security
Enforcement Principles, subject to (a) and (b) above, the relevant representative shall give notice to the other
representatives after which each such representative shall consult with the Security Agent for a period of 10 days
(or such lesser period as the relevant representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of
Enforcement, provided that such representatives shall not be obliged to consult more than once in relation to each
Enforcement Action.

172


-----

For the purposes of Enforcement, an “Instructing Group” means if prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge
Date (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if:

(a) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been repaid in full within six months of the end of the Consultation
Period (or within six months of the delivery of a specified notice by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
where no consultation period is required);

(b) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement
Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period (or within three months of the delivery of a
specified notice by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, where no consultation period is required); or

(c) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not
commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with
respect to such Relevant Company,

then the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by the Super
Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions) to the
exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting with any
instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) and the Instructing Group in
relation to such Enforcement shall mean the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors. Subject to the
foregoing, in the event of Conflicting Enforcement Instructions, the “Instructing Group” shall mean the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors provided that such instructions from the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors are Qualifying Instructions, it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the timeframe for the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction
Security or Distressed Disposal pursuant to such instructions will be determined by the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors.

Prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date: (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not
to enforce or to cease enforcing the Shared Security; or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing
Group in relation to the Shared Security, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any
instructions to enforce the Shared Security which the Majority Senior Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) are then entitled to give to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, as
described under the heading “—Restrictions on Enforcement by any Senior Notes; Senior Notes Standstill”
below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time any Senior Creditor or its Creditor Representative is then
entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Shared Security and the Majority Senior Creditors
do not give such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group
may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Shared Security as the Instructing Group sees fit in
lieu of any instructions to enforce given by the Senior Creditors or its Creditor Representative under this
Agreement and Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of any Senior Notes Only
Security where the Security Agent will act in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Creditors
(as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

_Security Enforcement Principles_

Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Cash
Management Facility Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Senior Secured Notes Required
Holders (as defined below) (if prior to the Senior Secured Notes Discharge Date), the Future Pari Passu Debt
Required Holders (as defined below) and the Issuer, enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted
in accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which are summarized as follows:

(a) It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize, so
far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from Enforcement of the Transaction
Security, the recovery by the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Notes Creditors and the Future Pari
Passu Creditors (the “Security Enforcement Objective”).

(b) The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either
(i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all cash) for
distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or (ii) if Enforcement is at the direction of the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Senior Creditors, sufficient proceeds from Enforcement
will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance

173


-----

with the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Super
Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(c) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject to the other
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the Enforcement
of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal (as defined below) pursuant to Enforcement will be
determined by the Instructing Group provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(d) On (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a member
of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5,000,000 (or its equivalent); or (ii) a
proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member of the
Group over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent shall (unless such enforcement is made
pursuant to a public auction or process supervised by a court of law which makes a determination as to
value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized investment bank or international
accounting firm or other reputable, third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing
valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to
be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert (A) on the optimal method of enforcing the
Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Principles and maximize recovery of any
such Enforcement Action, (B) that the proceeds received from enforcement is fair from a financial point of
view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance
with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a
Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement. The liability of any
Financial Advisor in respect of the opinions referred to in paragraph (d) above may be limited to the amount
of its fees in respect of such engagement.

(f) The Financial Advisor’s opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to
any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view
after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security
Enforcement Objective has been met.

(g) In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares referred to in (d)(i)
above and such Enforcement is conducted by way of public auction, any equity investors of the Group shall
be entitled to participate in such auction. There is no requirement in the Security Enforcement Principles
that requires the Enforcement of Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction.

(h) In the absence of written notice from a creditor or group of creditors that are not part of the relevant
Instructing Group that such creditor(s) object to any Enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds
that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an
“Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security is
in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(i) If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to
rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance with this Agreement), a Financial
Advisor’s opinion to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving
the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the requirement of paragraph (a) above
has been met.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of any Senior Notes Only
Security.

_Turnover_

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if any Super Senior Creditor, Cash Management Facility Creditor,
Senior Secured Notes Creditor, Senior Creditor and Future Pari Passu Creditor receives or recovers the proceeds
of any Enforcement of Transaction Security (whether before or after an insolvency event) or any Senior Notes
Only Security other than in accordance with Payments Waterfall that it shall (subject to certain prior actual
knowledge qualifications in the case of the Trustee and any Senior Notes Trustee, as applicable):

- in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold an amount of that
receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities of that creditor (or, if less, the amount received or
recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount or an amount equal to that amount
to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

174


-----

(ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant

(other than a member of the Group) shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any
Debt Document required to facilitate the matters described in each of the above paragraphs under the heading
“—Provisions Following an IPO.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Senior Notes and any Future Senior Debt are not refinanced in full on or
before the date of such IPO, for the purposes of the Group or Senior Liabilities, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall

purposes of the Group or Liabilities other than the Senior Liabilities (and all related provisions), the IPO
Pushdown Entity shall be the direct subsidiary thereof and (ii) if the Senior Notes and any Future Senior Debt
have been refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO Event but the Senior Secured Notes and any Future
Pari Passu Debt have not been refinanced in full on or before then, the Issuer shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity
and the Group (and all related provisions) shall continue to comprise the Issuer and each of its Restricted
Subsidiaries from time to time.

Borrower (a “Debt Transfer Borrower”) in respect of its Liabilities (including borrowing liabilities) under the
applicable Debt Documents be novated or otherwise transferred by that Debt Transfer Borrower (a “Debt
**Transfer”). Any Debt Transfer may be effected on a cashless basis, by way of book entries and not as physical**
cash movement to repay and re-borrow any applicable Liabilities.

held by Multiversity S.p.A. and confirmed to the lender of the Bridge to Cash Facility on or prior to the Issue
Date in accordance with the mechanic set out in the Bridge to Cash Facility (and in any case the Bridge to Cash
Facility shall not exceed a principal amount of €250.0 million).

Following the Post-Closing Reorganisation, Multiversity will assume the Cash Available, along with the rights
and obligations of Paganini BidCo S.p.A. under the Indenture, the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility (as
defined herein) and the Bridge to Cash Facility will be repaid from the Cash Available within the earlier of (a)
two Business Days following the completion and effectiveness of the Post-Closing Reorganisation and (b) 15
December 2022.

Other than security over the Cash Available on and from closing (following completion of a “white wash”
procedure pursuant to Article 2358 of the Italian Civil Code) held by Multiversity S.p.A., the Bridge to Cash
Facility will not benefit from any guarantees, security, or other credit support.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading
“Certain Definitions”. For purposes of this “Description of the Notes”, references to the “Issuer”, “we”, “our”,
and “us” refer only to Paganini BidCo S.p.A.

The Issuer will issue €765.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2028
(the “Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of October 27, 2021 (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the
Issuer, BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee and agent (mandatario con rappresentanza)
(the “Trustee”) and Noteholders’ Representative (as defined below), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as
security agent (the “Security Agent”) and Security Representative (as defined below), and The Bank of New
York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent. The Notes will not be guaranteed by any of the Subsidiaries of
the Issuer. The Indenture will not incorporate or include, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
as amended.

The offering of the Notes is expected to be consummated on October 27, 2021 (the “Issue Date”), which is
expected immediately prior to the acquisition of (i) the entire issued share capital of Wversity S.r.l., an entity
incorporated under the laws of Italy (“Wversity” and Wversity, together with its subsidiaries, the “Target
**_Group”) and (ii) the entire issued share capital in Multiversity S.r.l., (“Multiversity”) an entity incorporated_**
under the laws of Italy and an indirect subsidiary/joint venture investment of Wversity (together, such
investments being the “Multiversity Investment”) such that, at completion of the Multiversity Investment, the
Issuer will own, directly or indirectly, the entire issued share capital of Multiversity. The Initial Purchasers will,
concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the
offering of the Notes into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) pursuant to the terms of an escrow deed
(the “Escrow Agreement”) dated as of the Issue Date among the Issuer, the Trustee and The Bank of New York
Mellon, London Branch, as Notes escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). If the Multiversity Investment is not
consummated on or prior to January 31, 2022 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), the Notes will be redeemed at a
price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See
“—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”.

The Issuer will enter into the Bridge to Cash Facility to partially fund the Multiversity Investment. The quantum
of the Bridge to Cash Facility will be a principal amount of €221.6 million which represents an amount equal to
the Cash Available held by Multiversity S.p.A. (“MultiSpa”) for the purposes of the Multiversity Investment.
The Bridge to Cash Facility will be repaid within two Business Days following the completion and effectiveness
of the Post-Closing Reorganisation (as defined herein) (but in any event no later than December 15, 2022). As
described under “Summary—The Transactions” in this Offering Memorandum, Wversity and MultiSpa, an entity
incorporated under the laws of Italy and a wholly owned subsidiary of Wversity, hold cash (the “Cash
**Available”), which the Issuer will pay to the Seller in connection with the Multiversity Investment. The Cash**
Available will ultimately be used to discharge the Bridge to Cash Facility.

On the Acquisition Closing Date and upon release from the Escrow Account the proceeds of the offering of the
Notes sold on the Issue Date, amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Bridge to Cash Facility and
the Equity Contribution will be used by the Issuer to fund the Multiversity Investment and to pay the estimated
costs and expenses associated with the Transactions (as defined under “Summary—The Transactions”) as set
forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds”. In due course, the Issuer will use
reasonable endeavours to, within 18 months following the Issue Date, merge along with Wversity and
Multiversity S.p.A. into Multiversity under a reverse merger (the “Post-Closing Reorganisation”) with the
surviving entity being Multiversity. Following the Post-Closing Reorganisation, Multiversity will assume the
Cash Available, along with the rights and obligations of Paganini BidCo S.p.A. under the Indenture, the Notes
and the Revolving Credit Facility and the Bridge to Cash Facility will be repaid from the Cash Available within
two Business Days following the completion and effectiveness of the Post-Closing Reorganisation.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €765.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Notes will be issued in this Offering. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal
amount of additional Notes (the “Additional Notes”). We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in
compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of
Indebtedness (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). Except with
respect to right of payment and optional redemption, and as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Notes
issued in this Offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under
the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase; provided that such Additional Notes will not have the same CUSIP number, ISIN, Common Code or
other identifying number as the Notes Unless the Additional Notes are fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal

183


-----

income tax purposes. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes”, references to the
“Notes” include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the
terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes. Please see “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor_
Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the
Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you
should refer to the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations
of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon request.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will, upon issuance:

- be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer and other
obligations that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Revolving
Credit Facility;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- rank effectively senior to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is unsecured to the extent of
the value of the Collateral;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are
not Guarantors.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, such
Subsidiary will pay the holders of its debt and its trade creditors before it will be able to distribute any of its
assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor, if any.

Following the Issue Date, it is expected that the primary operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its
Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and
creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes therefore
will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders
(if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than future Guarantors, if any).

As of September 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its
consolidated subsidiaries would have had €806.7 million principal amount of indebtedness, of which
€765.0 million is represented by the Notes and €38.7 million would be drawn under the Revolving Credit
Facility. This does not include the Bridge to Cash Facility that will be secured by the Cash Available held by
Multiversity S.p.A., to the extent of the amount of the Cash Available and will be repaid from the Cash Available
within 2 of Business Days following the completion and effectiveness of the Post-Closing Reorganisation.
Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of
Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture
does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

184


-----

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue €765.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes on the Issue Date. The Notes will
mature on October 30, 2028. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**_Interest_**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to the sum of

(i) three-month EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero) plus

(ii) 4.25% per annum, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”), who shall initially be
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. Interest on the Notes will:

   - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;

   - be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30, commencing
on January 30, 2022;

   - be payable to the holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the
related interest payment date; and

   - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest
on the Notes.

“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the
Determination Date; provided that, EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does
not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London or
Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to
provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m.,
Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a
Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, EURIBOR for the
Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided,
the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London or Frankfurt, as selected by the Issuer, to provide
such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such
Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month
period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two
such rates are so provided, EURIBOR for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer
than two such rates are so provided then EURIBOR for the Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with
respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

If the Issuer determines, prior to any Determination Date, that:

(1) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR;

(2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently;

(3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR;

(4) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital markets
applicable generally to floating rate notes; or

(5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to calculate
any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR,

a Rate Determination Agent, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall select with the
prior consent of the Issuer a successor rate to EURIBOR that has been recommended or selected by the relevant
monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association
or body or that is expected to develop or has developed as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments
such as or comparable to the Notes in the European leveraged finance market or which has been adopted in other

185


-----

debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Notes which have been issued by a company owned by the
Sponsor in the European leveraged finance market (with no applicable adjustment spread) for use in calculating
the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to
each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least three Business Days prior to any
Determination Date, such Successor Rate (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and Paying
Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or
liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate.
Holders shall be bound by any such Successor Rate without any further action or consent by the Holders or the
Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the Successor Rate shall, in all cases, not be less than 0%. The
Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate. Following the adoption of any
Successor Rate, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate.

“euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the
first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date.

“Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an
independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed by the
Issuer at the expense of the Issuer, or, (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under
(a), the Issuer.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a
single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page EURIBOR01” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may
replace that page on that service, or, if no such page is available, such other page as may replace that page on
such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following
Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable
Rate to the principal amount of each Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying
each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages
resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth
of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or
.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the
Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be
final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate
permitted by applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying
that the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable law. The Issuer shall pay interest
(including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal at a rate that
is 1% higher than the then-applicable interest rate on the Notes to the extent lawful; it will pay interest (including
post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue instalments of interest, if any
(without regard to any applicable grace period), at the same rate to the extent lawful.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the
place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount
due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other
payment as a result of any such delay.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be
payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with
respect to the Notes represented by one or more Global Note registered in the name of or held by a nominee of a
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**

186


-----

for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by bank transfer to the
person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent,
_Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes”._

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be The Bank of
New York Mellon, London Branch (the “Principal Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar and Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch. The
Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and
will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice to
the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the
rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any change of Paying
Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is
expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Such notice of the change in a Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
may also be published on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent
and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

The Notes will not be guaranteed. Although there will be no initial Guarantors, if required by the covenant as
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit
Facility, Public Debt or certain other indebtedness shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor
of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined
herein), post-closing, sufficient guarantors will accede within 120 days of the earlier of (a) the Post-Closing
Reorganisation and (b) the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date such that entities contributing 80%
of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group that are located in Guarantor Jurisdictions (as defined herein) and
each Material Company (being each contributing 5% or more of Consolidated EBITDA of the Group on an
unconsolidated basis) become, subject to Agreed Security Principles, guarantors, see “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility—Guarantees”. In addition, security is to be granted (subject_
to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares in any additional borrower under the
Revolving Credit Facility (including on a limited recourse basis if the relevant shareholder is not a guarantor),
and any Material Company or other member of the Group located in a Guarantor Jurisdiction which becomes a
guarantor of the Revolving Credit Facility is required (subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles and certain limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—_
_Limitations on Granting Security Interests and Guarantees under Italian Law”) to grant security over shares in_
any Material Company that is its wholly-owned subsidiary and (if wholly owned by other members of the Group)
to have its own shares (or equivalent ownership interests) secured in favor of the Security Agent (including on a
limited recourse basis if the relevant shareholder is not a guarantor). For the avoidance of doubt, no security shall
be granted by (or over the quota in or loans made to) Target or MultiSpA.

To the extent provided in future, any Notes Guarantee will be a joint and several obligation of each Guarantor.

Each Notes Guarantee, if any, will:

- be a general senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor, secured as set forth under “Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes Guarantee, including obligations in respect
of the Revolving Credit Facility;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes Guarantee; and

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the applicable Guarantor
that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation.

187


-----

Any Notes Guarantees that are subject to limitations under applicable law will be contractually limited under the
applicable Notes Guarantee to reflect such limitations with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate
benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and
their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. In addition, each Notes Guarantee (if any) will be
limited to the maximum amount that would not render the relevant Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance
under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable
provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with
corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under
its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. For a description of such contractual limitations,
see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Issuer is
_incorporated in Italy, and Italian insolvency laws may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as insolvency_
_laws in other jurisdictions with which they may be familiar ”, “—Fraudulent conveyance and similar laws may_
_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes and the Collateral”,“—The Collateral and any future_
_guarantees of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity_
_and Enforceability of any Future Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations”._

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of
guarantees and security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other
legal or regulatory limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference
rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims, works council or other
employee consultation requirements and similar principles.

The Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor, if any, will automatically terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge”;_

(4) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its
liability with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) does not guarantee any other Credit Facility
which is a term facility which constitutes Senior Secured Indebtedness or Junior Lien Indebtedness or Public
Debt;

(5) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Notes Guarantees”;_

(8) as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited by the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;_

(9) in connection with an IPO Debt Pushdown in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

Upon the request of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions, including the
granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to
effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections
and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of
the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

188


-----

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

- Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited
with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/
or Clearstream.

- Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The
Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their
respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation
**S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written**
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A BookEntry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and
in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

189


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Note as the
owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the purposes
of the Indenture. Under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary”, we will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Our_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption_**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent,
pursuant to which the Initial Purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross
proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will
be pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to an escrow
charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). The initial funds
deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other
property and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.”

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Release”), the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, an Officer’s
Certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall rely, without further investigation, to the
effect that the following conditions (collectively the “Escrow Conditions”) have been met or will be satisfied:

- the Multiversity Investment will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Sale and Purchase
Agreement, within three Business Days following the release of the Escrowed Property, except for any
changes, waivers or other modifications that will not, individually or when taken as whole, have a material
adverse effect on the holders of the Notes;

- immediately after consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will own the entire share capital of Wversity
and, together with the shares owned by Multiversity S.p.A. in Multiversity, the entire share capital of
Multiversity; and

- as of the date thereof, there shall not have occurred an Event of Default under clause (5) of the first
paragraph under the heading titled “Events of Default” with respect to the Issuer.

The Release shall occur following receipt of the Officer’s Certificate in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. Upon the Release, the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall be
paid out in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agreement will provide that if an interest
payment date on the Notes occurs prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer may, at its option, elect to make
such interest payment with the Escrow Property upon delivery of an Officer Certificate to the Trustee, and the
Trustee will release the amount due for the payment of such interest, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, from the Escrow Charge. In the event that, notwithstanding the certifications contained in the
Officer’s Certificate delivered by the Issuer to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee pursuant to the immediately
preceding paragraph, the Multiversity Investment is not consummated within three Business Days following the
Release of the Escrowed Property further to the such delivery, the Issuer shall immediately redeposit with the
Escrow Agent the Escrowed Property (which for the avoidance of doubt shall be in an amount equal to the
amount of the Escrowed Property so released) and the Escrowed Property shall thereupon be (i) held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge, (ii) subject to the Lien of the
Escrow Charge to the same extent as it was immediately preceding such Release and (iii) subject to further
Release of the Escrowed Property in accordance with Release provision in the immediately preceding paragraph;
_provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall apply only with respect to the first Release_
and not any subsequent Release.

190


-----

In the event that (a) the Acquisition Closing Date does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date,
(b) the Issuer notifies the Escrow Agent and the Trustee that in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the
Multiversity Investment will not be consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date (c) the Issuer notifies the
Escrow Agent and the Trustee that the Investment Agreement has been fully and finally terminated at any time
on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date in accordance with its terms, (d) the Initial Investors cease to
beneficially own and control a majority of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Issuer or (e) an Event
of Default arises under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “Events of Default” on or prior
to the Escrow Longstop Date with respect to the Issuer (the date of such event being the “Special Termination
**Date”), the Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principle amount of the Notes (the “Special**
**Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the**
aggregate issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, plus accrued and
unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but
excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to the right of holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, and will provide
that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is given
by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption
**Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent (or other holder of the Escrow Property)**
shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such
Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if
any) to the Issuer.

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption
exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, Paganini Investments S.à r.l. will be required to fund the accrued
and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the Holders. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_the Transactions—If the Offering closes prior to the consummation of the Multiversity Investment, if certain_
_conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will be required to redeem its_
_Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes”._

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Issuer will grant to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Holders of the Notes a security interest in the Escrow Account. Upon receipt by the Trustee of an
Officer’s Certificate (upon which the Trustee shall be entitled to rely without liability) for the release (provided
funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price are in the Escrow Account) the Trustee shall be
deemed to consent to the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special
Mandatory Redemption.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date the Notes will be secured by a first-ranking security interest in the Escrowed Property. See
“—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”.

On or about the Issue Date (except as otherwise specified below), the Notes will be secured, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement, certain legal reservations and perfection
requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by security interests granted on an equal and ratable firstpriority basis over the following property, rights and assets:

(1) limited recourse pledge over Paganini Investments S.à r.l.’s shares in the Issuer;

(2) limited recourse security interest agreement over Paganini Investments S.à r.l.’s intercompany receivables
owing to it by the Issuer (if any); and

(3) within 20 Business Days following the Post-Closing Reorganisation, limited recourse pledge over Paganini
Investments S.à r.l.’s shares in Multiversity;

together, the “Collateral”.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, additional security interests_

191


-----

may be granted over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, including for the benefit of any Additional Notes issued by the Issuer as permitted under
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and
_any Future Notes Guarantees”._

Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Notes
Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral”. All Collateral will be subject to the operation of
the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees”, certain property, rights and assets (other than the Collateral described_
in the first and second paragraphs of this section) may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and
assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The
following is a summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles:

- general legal, regulatory and statutory limitations, financial assistance (including under Article 2358 and/or
2374 of the Italian Civil Code), capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, transfer pricing, “interest stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax
restrictions, “exchange control restrictions”, “liquidity impairment” rules, thin capitalization rules, retention
of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a Notes Guarantee or
security or may require that the Notes Guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any
such limit applies, the Notes Guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount
which the relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any
jurisprudence) and subject to fiduciary duties of management;

- a key factor in determining whether or not a guarantee or security shall be taken is the applicable time and
cost (including material adverse tax consequences or adverse effects on interest deductibility and stamp
duty, registration taxes, notarisation and registration fees) which shall not be disproportionate to the benefit
to the Holders of the Notes of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- the giving of a Notes Guarantee, the granting and the terms of security or the perfection of the security
granted will not be required to the extent that the Group would incur any legal fees, registration fees,
notarial fees, stamp duty, taxes and any other fees or costs directly associated with such security or Notes
Guarantee which are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the secured parties and/or having regard to
the extent of the obligations which can be guaranteed or secured by that security and the priority that will be
offered by taking or perfecting the security. In particular, it is acknowledged that the Issuer and/ or
Guarantor have agreed not to opt (where possible) for the Imposta Sostitutiva regime pursuant to article 15
and subsequent of Italian Presidential Decree No. 601/1973 as amended and supplemented from time to
time. Accordingly, Italian security that requires payment of an ad valorem registration tax on the amount of
the secured obligations will not be taken unless it can be executed by way of exchange of correspondence or
minimised upon execution (including through a cap on the amount of the secured obligations agreed
between the Security Agent and the Issuer, each acting reasonably). Non-Italian security that requires
payment of an ad valorem registration tax on the amount of the secured obligation will not be taken if tax
duty cannot be minimized upon execution (including through a cap to the secured obligations agreed
between the security agent and the Issuer (each acting reasonably));

- where there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets owned by the Issuer or
any Guarantor in a particular category, the principle stated in the second previous bullet above shall apply
and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, only the material assets in that category shall be subject to
security;

- in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible, impractical or disproportionately costly to grant Notes
Guarantees or create security over certain categories of assets, in which event such Notes Guarantees will
not be granted and security will not be taken over such assets;

- certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external
body’s or person’s consent may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or
security. Such guarantee and/or security shall not be required unless such consent has been received;

- any assets subject to legal requirements, licenses or any other third-party arrangements (including, without
limitation, any trade receivables) which may prevent those assets from being charged (or assets which, if
charged, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or
obligations of the Group in respect of those assets or require any member of the Group to take any action

192


-----

materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof) will be excluded from any relevant
Security Document; no security shall be required over (and no consent or waiver request submitted with
respect to) assets which are required to support indebtedness assumed in connection with an acquisition to
the extent permitted by the terms of the Notes Documents to remain outstanding following a Permitted
Acquisition (“Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness”) and no member of the target group acquired pursuant
to a Permitted Acquisition where Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness remains outstanding following
completion of such Permitted Acquisition shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security with
respect to the Notes Documents if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing such Assumed
Acquisition Indebtedness;

- members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into Security Documents if
they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the
relevant members of the Group or if the same would conflict with the fiduciary duties of those directors or
contravene any legal prohibition, bona fide contractual restriction or any regulatory condition or prohibition
or result in (or in a material risk of) personal or criminal liability on the part of any Officer or result in any
significant risk of legal liability for the directors of any Group company. Furthermore, members of the
Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into Security Documents if the foregoing may,
in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer, have an adverse impact on the credit rating of any member of the
Group or any debt or other instrument issued by a member of the Group or in respect of which a member of
the Group is a trustee, corporate administrator or similar or analogous function or if the relevant member of
the Group is acting as a trustee or similar or analogous function in a securitisation, structured financing or
other similar arrangement;

- additional guarantee limitation provisions may be included in any supplemental indenture if required by any
Officer of any member of the Group in connection with the granting of a Notes Guarantee in order to protect
that Officer from potential liability or other legal risk;

- the terms of the security should not be such that they materially restrict the running of the business of or
materially adversely affect the tax arrangements of the relevant member of the Group in the ordinary course
as or otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents;

- the security will be first ranking, to the extent possible and subject to any Permitted Liens, and shall be
limited to security over the shares in each Guarantor, provided that the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that the liabilities in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations shall
effectively rank in priority to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with respect to proceeds from the
enforcement of such security;

- information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if and only to the extent, required by local law and local
market practice to be provided solely to perfect or register the relevant security interests will be provided
annually upon the reasonable request of the Security Agent or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and notice has been provided in accordance with the terms of the Indenture such that immediate
repayment of the Notes is required (and such notice has not been withdrawn, cancelled or otherwise ceased
to have effect), at the Security Agent’s reasonable request;

- perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as reasonably
practicable. The giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of
security interests granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
relevant Issuer or Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise
permitted by the Notes Documents (and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek
consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph);

- any Security Document entered into by a member of the Group shall be governed by the law of and secure
assets located in or otherwise governed or expressed to be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of
incorporation of that member of the Group, provided that security over shares shall be governed by the
jurisdiction of incorporation of the member of the Group whose shares are the subject of security;

- access to the assets of the Issuer or a Guarantor and the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be
restricted or limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and
duties where the benefit of increasing the Notes Guarantee or secured amount is disproportionate to the level
of such fees, taxes and duties (and in any event the maximum aggregate amount payable by the Group in
respect of fees, costs, expenses, disbursements and non-recoverable value added tax (“VAT”) relating to the
provision of guarantees and security shall be limited to an amount to be agreed between the security agent
and the Issuer and no guarantee or security will be required until such amount is agreed);

- no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where a member of the Group is not incorporated;

193


-----

- no perfection action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group;

- the Security Agent will hold one set of security interests for the secured parties to the extent reasonably
practicable taking into account local law considerations;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over, or over the assets of, or loans to, any joint venture
or similar arrangement or any minority interest or from any member of the Group which is not incorporated
or established in a Guarantor Jurisdiction;

- no guarantees or security will be required to be given by Wversity or Multiversity S.p.A. or in respect of the
shares or other interests held in such entities (or loans made to such entities) by other members of the
Group. If required to be granted in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, any pledge to be granted
over the shares in Universita Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. shall be granted by Multiversity as the surviving
entity of the Post-Closing Reorganisation;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security
over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over
the material assets only;

- each Security Document should contain a clause which records that: (i) if there is a conflict between the
Security Document and the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement then (to the extent permitted by law) the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, shall take priority over the provisions of the Security
Document; (ii) notwithstanding any provision of a Security Document, nothing which is permitted to be
done under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be
deemed to constitute a breach of any term of a Security Document; and (iii) no representation, warranty,
undertaking or other provision contained in a Security Document shall be breached to the extent it conflicts
with (or is more onerous than an equivalent provision in) the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or prohibit or condition any transaction or matter which would
otherwise be permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

- no Notes Guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations’
Implications for Loan Documentation”, and any update thereto by the LSTA;

- any Security Document shall only be required to be notarized or notarially certified if required by law in
order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence or for the document to bear a
“certified date” as a matter of Italian law;

- no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required;

- no member of the Group will be required to create security over, or otherwise encumber the shares or assets
of, or any loans to, any Unrestricted Subsidiary or any subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary and no
Unrestricted Subsidiary or any subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be required to become a
Guarantor;

- in the Security Documents, there will be no repetition or extension of clauses set out in the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, such as those relating to notices, costs
and expenses, indemnities, tax gross-up, distribution of proceeds and release of security; and

- no member of the Group will be required to create security over or otherwise encumber any asset which is
excluded by virtue of the application of the other Agreed Security Principles.

The Agreed Security Principles also set out certain additional factors which will apply when determining the
extent of the guarantees and the security to be provided and certain additional principles which will be reflected
in any security taken.

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility as
well as certain Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes and may also secure certain future indebtedness;
_provided, however, that pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility_
and counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations will receive the proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral in priority to the holders of the Notes and any Additional Notes. See “—Priority” below. See also,
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—Creditors under

194


-----

_the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging liabilities and certain debt that we may incur in the future will be_
_entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes.”_
The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
holders of the Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature, some
or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the
Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral_
_may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes”._

**_Priority_**

The relative contractual priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the
Security Documents (the “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility,
(b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations and (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders
of the Notes under the Indenture, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Indenture, the Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility, and such
Hedging Obligations, which provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Notes will receive
proceeds on enforcement of security over the Collateral only after the claims of the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and such Hedging Obligations and any future Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super
priority basis in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement are satisfied.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. In addition, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral
may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens”, “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”._

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure, inter alia, the payment
when due of the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be
entered into among, inter alios, the relevant security provider, the Security Agent, also as Security
Representative (as defined below) and agent (mandatario con rappresentanza), and, with respect to the Security
Documents governed by Italian law, the Trustee acting for itself and in its capacity as trustee and agent
(mandatario con rappresentanza), under the Indenture and also as Noteholders’ Representative (as defined
below).

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws,
only the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) will have the right to enforce the
Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee (including in its role as Noteholders’ Representative) and the
holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to
take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the
Indenture (including in its role as Noteholders’ Representative), who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) for the
Collateral. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain hedging agreements in relation to the Security
Interest in favor of such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and
the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the
Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees”. The validity and enforceability of the_
Security Interests will be subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any_
_Future Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents and the Indenture must be
exercised by the Security Agent. The Holders may only act through the Trustee (including in its role as
Noteholders’ Representative), who will instruct the Security Agent (including in its role as Security
Representative) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interest created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the

195


-----

Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interest or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any
_Future Notes Guarantees”._

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the
Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in
certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. These limitations are
described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of any Future Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency_
_Law Considerations”. The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future_
indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of Notes, the counterparties to Hedging
Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee (including in its role as Noteholders’ Representative) have,
and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent
under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security
Documents. Furthermore, each holder will have deemed to have appointed the Security Agent as agent
(mandatario con rappresentanza) pursuant to article 1704 of the Italian Civil Code and as security representative
(rappresentante per le garanzie) pursuant to article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code to act on its
behalf. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of Notes, the counterparties to Hedging
Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed
to have, authorized the Security Agent (and, where applicable, the Trustee) to (i) perform the duties and exercise
the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together with any other
incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification,
amendment, confirmation, extension, renewal, replacement or discharge expressed to be executed by the Security
Agent (or, where applicable, the Trustee) in its name and on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the
section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

The Indenture will also provide that each holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements;

(2) authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee, as applicable, to act in its name and on its behalf to enter into
the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby and to perform their
respective obligations and exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith;

(3) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(4) agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as security representative
(rappresentante per le garanzie) of the Holders for the purposes of Article 2414-bis, third paragraph of the
Italian Civil Code;

(5) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents; and

(6) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act in its name and on its behalf to enter into
and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Please see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes
_Guarantees—The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral” and_
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements”._

**_IPO Debt Pushdown_**

On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) will provide (and the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such
provisions) that the Issuer or its successor shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the
Security Agent) that the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice) as
described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Release and/or
_Transfer of Claims and Liabilities in Respect of any Senior Notes and the Notes and the Transaction Security—_
_Provisions Following an IPO.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any_
amendment to the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or
the Security Documents required by the Issuer and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer in order
to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by this paragraph, including releasing security and
guarantees, provided that any such amendment or action will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee
or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—There are circumstances_
_other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be released automatically_
_without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Issuer, its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to the release of the Security Interest in
respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) (a) subject to clause (b) below, in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (i) a Person
that is not a Parent, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
_Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or (ii) any Restricted Subsidiary;_
_provided that this clause 1(a)(ii) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of capital stock or of_
accounts receivable to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless the relevant
property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes
following such sale or disposal; and

(b) any release of the Security Interest in respect of the Capital Stock of the Issuer pursuant to clause 1(a)
shall only be permitted if such Capital Stock is subject to a Lien of at least equivalent ranking (in the
good faith judgment of the Issuer) in favor of the Holders of the Notes as soon as reasonably
practicable after such release;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or defeasance or discharge
of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary and intercompany receivable claims against such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary following the release of its Liens
granted in favor of the Revolving Credit Facility (other than in connection with a repayment or refinancing
of the Revolving Credit Facility in full), so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
release of the property and assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary, provided that there is no
other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary that would result in the
requirement for the Notes and the Notes Guarantees to be secured on such property, assets or Capital Stock
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” or the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(7) with respect to the Security Interests in respect of the entire Capital Stock of the IPO Entity and any security
granted by any of its holding companies (and security over intercompany receivables owing by the IPO
Entity and any of its holding companies), within a reasonable time to facilitate an Initial Public Offering of

197


-----

the relevant IPO Entity; provided that (a) security interests under Security Documents exist or will upon the
Initial Public Offering exist over the shares in a member of the Group as selected by the Company which
holds (directly or indirectly) all or substantially all of the assets of the Group plus (if the shares in Certipass
S.r.l. are still held by the Issuer at such time as a sister entity, subject to and in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles) a security interest over the shares in Certipass S.r.l. (ignoring, for the avoidance of
doubt, assets which are the shares in that member of the Group and the shares of any Parent of that member
of the Group) (the “Going Concern Assets”) such that a single point of enforcement in respect of the Going
Concern Assets will be maintained after the Initial Public Offering of the IPO Entity (in each case, as
determined by the Company in good faith)) and (b) such Security Interests so released shall be promptly
granted in favor of the Notes in the event that the Initial Public Offering does not complete for any reason
and any other releases in respect of an IPO Debt Pushdown in addition to the foregoing in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(9) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interest created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”.

At the request of the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Trustee (if required) will take all necessary action
required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without
the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.

**_Optional Redemption_**

Except as described below and except as described under “Redemption for Taxation Reasons”, the Notes are not
redeemable until October 30, 2022. On and after October 30, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to
time, part of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a price of 100.000% plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date. In addition, prior to October 30, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time
to time, a part of each of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price
equal to 100.000% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right
of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent. If such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any
or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in
the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or
more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may provide
in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to
such redemption may be performed by another Person, and such notice of redemption may be extended if such
conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the Issuer by notice to the Holders.

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise. Notice of
redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

198


-----

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any such
redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

If requested in writing by the Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or
pursuant to the applicable Officer’s Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed,
designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the
Holders prior to the applicable redemption date; provided, however, that Holders shall have received at least
three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of
redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable
redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or
any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a Global Note deposited with a
common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as
participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system.
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be liable to any Holder by virtue of the Issuer instructing the Trustee
or the Paying Agent to make an early distribution of funds as described in this paragraph.

**_Sinking Fund_**

Other than a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments
or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**_Post-Tender Optional Redemption_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase for the Notes
(including, without limitation, any Change of Control Offer and any Asset Disposition Offer), if holders of not
less than 90% in aggregate principal amount outstanding of a series of Notes validly tender and do not validly
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of
the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such holders, all of the
holders of the Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and accordingly, the Issuer or
such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than
30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in
whole, but not in part, following such purchase, at a price equal to the price offered (excluding any early tender
premium or similar payment) to each other holder of Notes in such tender offer or other offer to purchase, plus,
to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding such redemption date.

**_Redemption at Maturity_**

On October 30, 2028, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and
cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if
any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Principal Paying Agent or the Registrar will select
Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which
the Notes are listed, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not
so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or
Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis by use of a pool
factor; provided, however, that no Definitive Registered Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less
shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Principal
Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in a daily newspaper with general circulation
in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) and in addition to such publication, not less than
10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. While in global
form, notices to Holders may be delivered via Euroclear and Clearstream in lieu of notice via registered mail.
Such notice of redemption may also be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu) in lieu of publication in the Luxemburger Wort so long as the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange are complied with.

199


-----

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive
Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note
redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive
Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

**_Redemption for Taxation Reasons_**

The Issuer may redeem any series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the relevant series of Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts
(as defined below under “Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as
a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or
rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Notes
would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such series of Notes (but, in the case of a
Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another
Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and such obligation
cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be
announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions
shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of
Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional
Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any series of Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to
its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing
to the effect that the Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change
in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as
sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in
which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**_Withholding Taxes_**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or
with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by
law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made by or on behalf of a Payor, or
any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise
considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof
or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

200


-----

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with
respect to any Note, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor
will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such
withholding, or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not
be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note in the
absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable
for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of,
or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including,
without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying
on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights
under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the
Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least
30 days before any such withholding would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or
other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to
make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or
beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment of the principal of, premium, if
any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are on account of imposta sostitutiva (pursuant to Italian Legislative
Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time (“Legislative Decree
**No. 239”) and any related implementing regulations, and pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of**
November 21, 1997 (“Legislative Decree No. 461”) and any related implementing regulations)) and any
related implementing regulations; provided that:

(i) Additional Amounts shall be payable in circumstances where the procedures required under Legislative
Decree No. 239 or Legislative Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption from imposta
_sostitutiva have not been complied with due solely to the actions or omissions of the Payor or their_
agents; and

(ii) for the avoidance of doubt, no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to Taxes to the extent
such Taxes are on account of imposta sostitutiva if the Holder becomes subject to imposta sostitutiva
after the Issue Date by reason of amendments to the list of countries which allow for a satisfactory
exchange of information with Italy, currently provided for by Italian Ministerial Decree dated
September 4, 1996, as subsequently amended, or by reason of the approval of the ministerial Decree to
be issued under art. 11 par .4 let c) of Legislative Decree No. 239, as subsequently amended or
superseded, providing for a new list of countries which allow for a satisfactory exchange of
information with Italy, whereby such Holders country of residence does not appear on the aforesaid
amended or new list (the “White List”);

(7) any Taxes to the extent that such Taxes result from payment to a non-Italian resident legal entity or a
non-Italian resident individual which is resident in a country which does not appear on the White List;

(8) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version
of such sections that are substantively comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official

201


-----

interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement
between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing or any agreements
entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect
to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if,
notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available,
certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made
available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Notes Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and
the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay
Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts
arises less than 30 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s
Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay (and will indemnify the Holder for) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) or
any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or
additions to tax) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of any
Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Security Documents, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto (other than, in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this Offering) or the
receipt of any payments with respect thereto or any such taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related
interest, penalties, collection duties or additions to tax) imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in
connection with, the enforcement of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee or any Security Documents (limited,
solely in the case of any such taxes or similar charges or levies attributable to the receipt of any payments with
respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses
(1) through (3) and (5) through (8) or any combination thereof) excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
registration, stamp duty, documentary or other similar tax, charge or levy arising from the execution of any
formality made directly by, or on behalf of the Holder and not necessary to maintain, preserve, establish, or
enforce the rights of such Holder under the Notes, any Notes Guarantee, any Security Document, the Indenture,
or any other document or instrument in relation thereto.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply
_mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax_
purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or
with respect to the Notes is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein.

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of
_Control”, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Holder’s_
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to
repurchase any series of Notes as described under this heading, “Change of Control”, in the event and to the
extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series as described under
“—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60_
days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder
of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the
Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase
(subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment
date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed) and the record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that
any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow
in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount
of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global Notes
in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by
book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal
amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in
a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require,
the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or to the extent and in the manner
permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such
Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing
for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a
mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain events that may
constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of
Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future
Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute
a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the
exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or
require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial
effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase
may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds
will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—Future liquidity and cash flow difficulties could prevent_
_us from repaying the Notes when due or repurchasing the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to_
_certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision contained in the_
_Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of
the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree
of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the sale of assets, property and Capital Stock pursuant to a
Specified Asset Disposition will not constitute “substantially all assets” for any purpose under the Indenture.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

-----

Available RP Capacity Amount provided that to the extent Available RP Capacity Amount is used to Incur
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (17), the Incurrence of such Indebtedness shall reduce the capacity to
make Restricted Payments at such time pursuant to the relevant Restricted Payment provisions under the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or pursuant to the
relevant Permitted Payment provisions under the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” in an amount equal to the Available RP Capacity Amount so utilized
(it being understood that the capacity to make any Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or any Permitted Payments provision
under the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” may not
be reduced below zero under this provision); and

(18) Indebtedness under the Bridge to Cash Facility until repaid in full.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in
the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from
time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of
such Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first
paragraph of this covenant; provided that any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (7), (11), (12)(b),
(13), (14), (16) and (17) of the second paragraph of this covenant shall cease to be deemed Incurred or
outstanding pursuant to such clauses (7), (11), (12)(b), (13), (14), (16) and (17), as applicable, but shall be
deemed Incurred and outstanding pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first
date on which the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, could have Incurred such
Indebtedness thereunder (to the extent the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries are able to Incur any Liens
related to such Indebtedness as Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens after such
reclassification);provided that the Issuer may in its sole discretion further reclassify such Indebtedness into
other applicable clauses under the first and second paragraphs of this covenant;

(2) (a) Indebtedness Incurred under the Bridge to Cash Facility shall be deemed to have been Incurred under
clause (18) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be reclassified; and (b) all Indebtedness
Incurred under any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit Facility) that is secured by Liens on the
Collateral that are accorded super senior priority status under the Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed
to have been Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or second paragraph
above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other
Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of
a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase
price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference
thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more
other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated
EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries and as otherwise set out in this “Description of the Notes” as applicable;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to
the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP;

(9) the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any provision of this covenant or secured
pursuant to the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Liens” (a) shall be deemed to include all amounts
necessary to renew, refund, redeem, refinance, replace, restructure, defease or discharge any such
Indebtedness Incurred and/or secured pursuant to such provisions, including after giving effect to additional

208


-----

Indebtedness in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of fees, premia and other costs and expenses
Incurred in connection with such renewal, refund, redemption, refinancing, replacement, restructuring,
defeasance or discharge; and (b) in any case where such amounts are or may be based on Consolidated
EBITDA (or any ratio of which Consolidated EBITDA is a component), shall not be deemed to be
exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the
amount of Consolidated EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and such Lien will be
permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or
replacement, such excess (and without prejudice to any deemed inclusions under (a) above) will continue);
and

(10) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien
pursuant to clauses (10), (28), (29) or (32) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” or any Permitted Collateral
Lien, the Incurrence thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes
of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or use of clauses (1) through (18) of the
preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be
determined, at the Issuer’s election, on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or
increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date,
_provided that in the case of making any calculation under the Indenture, such assumption should only be_
made to the extent that a pro forma adjustment is being taken into account in determining Consolidated
EBITDA in connection with the proceeds of the use thereof (unless the Issuer elects otherwise)) or other
Indebtedness, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is
satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant and
under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens” irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or
creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be
borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a
date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such
date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio,
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable and subject to the terms of such definitions,
or other provision of the Indenture, and, to the extent the usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the second
preceding paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses, to the
extent it would, if actually borrowed, be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined
on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and, in each
case, the Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”. Except as
otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or
liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”,
the Issuer will not be permitted to designate such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary and any such
designation will not be deemed operative under the Indenture).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred
or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
euro- denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the

209


-----

date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long
as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of
the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) if and as elected by the Issuer, the Euro Equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date or on the date on which such Indebtedness was
originally Incurred or committed; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is
subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such
Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will, if elected by the Issuer, be adjusted to take
into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing or, at the option of the Issuer, the
date when such Indebtedness was first committed.

No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness

agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the
encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement
or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the

refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption plus
any applicable premia or make-whole; (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do
not constitute Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided that the Issuer shall prepay, repay,
purchase or redeem Public Debt (other than the Notes) pursuant to clause (ii) only if the Issuer makes (at
such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance
with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of
Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to
(y) the sum total aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal
amount outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the Notes) or (iv) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
(including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or private negotiated transactions at
market prices) Subordinated Indebtedness and/or any indebtedness of a Parent Entity (and any proceed loans
in respect of the foregoing) (or make any payment in order to facilitate any such prepayment, repayment,
purchase or redemption) if the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries would be permitted to do so at such time
under clause (10)(ii) and/or (iii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments”;_

(B) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such series of Notes at a purchase price in

Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (to the extent Holders elect
not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not
tendered shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (as defined below)), or redeem any series of
Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all
Holders of the Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below);

(C) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after

(F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (A), (C), (D), (E) or
(F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a

217


-----

permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such application is consummated, (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the
aforementioned 24 month period (such 180 day period being the Binding Commitment Period) or, if that
legally binding commitment has been terminated during the Binding Commitment Period, the 180th day
after the date on which that legally binding commitment was so terminated (the “Extended Binding
**Commitment Period”), if such application has not been consummated by that date.**

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph shall constitute “Excess
**Proceeds” in the following amounts and such determination may be made by the Issuer on any date on or after**
such Asset Disposition at the Issuer’s election:

(1) if the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries exceeds
4.25:1.00, 100% of such Net Available Cash; or

(2) if the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries exceeds
3.75:1.00 but does not exceed 4.25:1.00, 50% of such Net Available Cash; or

(3) if the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries does not
exceed 3.75:1.00, 0% of such Net Available Cash,

and any Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant to this paragraph shall be
immediately available to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purposes permitted by the Indenture,
including to make Restricted Payments in accordance with clause (20) of the definition of “Permitted Payments,”
without regard to the periods specified in the second paragraph of this covenant.

Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise invest or use such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms
of the Indenture.

On the day after the end of the 24 month period above (or 1st day after the end of either the Binding
Commitment Period or Extended Binding Commitment Period, as applicable, if a binding commitment as
described in clause (H) is entered into) after an Asset Disposition, or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds (i) 20% of Consolidated EBITDA and €30.0 million in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions or (ii) 30% of Consolidated EBITDA and €40.0 million per year
(excluding any Excess Proceeds under the foregoing sub-clause (i) of this paragraph), the Issuer will be required
within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the
extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Senior Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu
Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Loans to prepay, repay or
repurchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased, redeemed or prepaid out of the
Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari
Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the
principal amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, redemption or prepayment plus any premia or
make-whole, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Senior
Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu
Indebtedness so validly tendered (or in respect of which holders or lenders thereof accepted such offer) and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use
any remaining Excess Proceeds any purpose not prohibited by the covenants in the Indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Senior Secured
Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders (or in respect of which holders or
lenders thereof accepted such offer), collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds
shall be allocated among the Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be prepaid,
redeemed or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of Notes, Senior
Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered (or in respect of which offers were accepted). For the
purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such
Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined
as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected or otherwise offered or been required to prepay,
repay, redeem or purchase any amount of Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness or other Pari Passu Indebtedness at

218


-----

a price of no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof under this covenant (including pursuant to any Asset
Disposition Offer), to the extent the Holders of the Notes or the creditors in respect of such Senior Secured
Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness elect not to tender their Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness or Pari
Passu Indebtedness or accept any such offer for such prepayment, repayment, redemption or purchase or have
declined or refused any prepayment, repayment, redemption or purchase, such amount not tendered or accepted,
or such amount which is declined or refused, shall be deemed “Declined Proceeds.”

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is
actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business
Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (or, in respect of other Senior Secured
Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness, if different, such other period prescribed by the terms thereof) (each an
“Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it
elects, Senior Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid, prepaid or purchased by it
pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been so validly tendered or accepted, all Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu
Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the applicable Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer (or relevant Restricted Subsidiary, if
applicable) will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment (or make payment), on a pro rata basis to the extent
necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu
Indebtedness or portions of Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
(or in respect of which holders or lenders thereof accepted such offer) and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, all Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof
were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of
the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase
price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for
purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee
(or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail
or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal
to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal
amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or
delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (i) 15%
Consolidated EBITDA and (ii) €20.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction
in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of (i) 25%
Consolidated EBITDA and (ii) €35.0 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of

auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the
Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities
Act.

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports
furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof and to the extent that
the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, by posting such reports on the official
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the
Issuer posts copies of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant on

All financial statement information shall be prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP as in
effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of GAAP as then in effect) and
on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information or set

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports”
covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

Exchange, NASDAQ or any regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the European Union, and

of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, the Euronext
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Milan Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the New York Stock

-----

Exchange, NASDAQ or any regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the European Union, for
so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and
other reports that the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with such stock
exchange. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements require the
Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports
with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Milan
Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ or any regulated
stock exchange established in a Member State of the European Union, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as
to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such
annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the
SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this “Reports”
covenant by providing any report or financial statements (x) of Multiversity S.r.l. (prior to the Post-Closing
Reorganisation) or (y) of a Parent, in each case, in lieu of those for the Issuer, so long as such reports (if an
annual or quarterly report) meet the relevant requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this
“Reports” covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were references to Multiversity Group or a Parent, as the
case may be, (as determined at the sole discretion of the Issuer). Upon complying with the requirements set forth
in the preceding sentence, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the
preceding paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, if delivering reports or financial statements of a Parent, no
indebtedness of any Parent shall be taken into account when making any calculations otherwise required under
the Indenture. To the extent any material differences exist between the management, business, assets,
shareholding or results of operations or financial condition of the Issuer, Multiversity Group or any Parent that is
the reporting entity (if applicable), the annual and quarterly reports shall include an explanation and an unaudited
reconciliation of such material differences.

Any reports in respect of periods commencing prior to the Acquisition Closing Date (including in respect of any
comparative information) may, upon the election of the Issuer, include only the consolidated financial
information of the Target Group without any other financial information, but after giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions. For purposes of this covenant and any determination or calculation to be made under the Indenture,
the Issuer may use financial statements of the Target Group for reporting or making calculations with respect to
periods commencing prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, in the event that any period specified in the Indenture
for the Group to deliver any financial statements, documents or other information expires on a day which is not a
Business Day, that period shall be extended so as to expire on the next Business Day.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union (or former member of the European
Union), the United Kingdom, or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District
of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not
the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in
form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such

223


-----

transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur
at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less
than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate, each to the effect that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been authorized, executed and
delivered and is, subject to customary qualifications and assumptions, a legal, valid and binding agreement
enforceable against the Successor Company (in each case, subject to customary qualifications and
assumptions, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that in giving an
Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be
Incurred by any Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in
compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have
been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and
assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “Merger and
_Consolidation” covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the_
Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”
and (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets of such
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, becomes a Guarantor;

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor
under its Notes Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and
delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); and (2) immediately after giving effect to
the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a Guarantor (in each case
other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture,

224


-----

_provided however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this covenant shall not apply to the_
extent that compliance with clauses (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation
of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization
rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or
(except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the
partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any
Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):
(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of
its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of its
properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule,
regulation or order, recommendation or directions of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer
into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the
relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under
the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; (v) a Permitted Reorganization or the liquidation or
winding up of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (vi) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating
into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such
entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (3)(A) or
(3)(B) under the heading “—The Guarantors”, as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction and
(vii) Specified Asset Disposition.

**_Post-Closing Reorganisation_**

The Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, for a period of 18 months following the Issue Date (and
subject to any relevant approval and/or authorisation by any competent authority) to complete the Post-Closing
Reorganisation, provided that if the Post-Closing Reorganisation is not completed, such failure to complete the
Post-Closing Reorganisation shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default, and provided further that
holders of the Notes agrees for the purposes of Articles 2503 and 2503-bis (et seq.) of the Italian Civil Code to
the consummation of the Post-Closing Reorganisation and the assumption by Multiversity of all obligations of
the Issuer in respect of the Notes Documents in accordance with the Indenture upon completion of the PostClosing Reorganisation.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion
**Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:**

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Additional Notes Guarantees”;

(6) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”; and

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation”,_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard

225


-----

to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the
Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default.
The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of
the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness

Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue
Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”. In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or
Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take
actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the
contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no
longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee upon the occurrence of a
Suspension Event or a Reversion Date, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension
of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever
achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to
take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders
and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and may effect a Permitted Reorganization and
the Collateral may be discharged and released and retaken, if applicable, in accordance with the Indenture, the
applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
(ii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or replaced, from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency
therein; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i) above, except with respect to any discharge or release in
accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, released and retaken, if applicable, or otherwise modified or replaced, unless
contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the
solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate
from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such
Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or
Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified
or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in
equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Notes Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, any Credit Facility which is a term facility which
constitutes Senior Secured Indebtedness or Junior Lien Indebtedness or any other Public Debt, in each case of the
Issuer or a Guarantor unless (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes
a Guarantor by no later than 10 Business Days after the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if
applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted

226


-----

Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee, which Notes Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such
Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes
Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or
violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization
rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous
restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case
of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or
(3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses Incurred in connection with any governmental or
regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (2) undertaken in connection with
such Guarantee which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary. At the option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on such Guarantor’s
liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financials assistance,
corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Notes
_Guarantees”. A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the_
date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after
the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had
not been designated as a Guarantor, or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was
Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the
date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the
Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes
Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors”.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into_
with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing
Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially
less favorable to the Holders), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of Notes Guarantees
and priority and release of the Security Interest; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent
under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the
amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or
an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make
provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted
Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the
Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter
into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
“Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional

227


-----

Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”.

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at the offices of
the listing agent.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When determining the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture in connection with any
transaction or making any calculation as to whether such transaction is permitted under the Indenture (including,
for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any Incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness or Liens, the
making of any Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or Investment, any Asset Disposition, any acquisition,
merger, joint venture, consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination and any other transaction
requiring the testing of any basket, including, without limitation, in determining whether a Change of Control
constitutes a Specified Change of Control Event), the date of determination of such basket or ratio or the testing
of any such transaction and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be any Relevant
Transaction Date, and such baskets or ratios may, at the option of the Issuer, be calculated with such pro forma
adjustments as are contemplated by the pro forma provisions set forth in the definition of Consolidated EBITDA
and the definition of Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and as otherwise contemplated by the Indenture
after giving effect to such transaction and other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including
any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for
purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such
baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in
the Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or that arises from an asset or a target
company subject to such transaction) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a
result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is permitted hereunder and
(y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related
transactions, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer; provided that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations
occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement or other Relevant Transaction Date which is prior to the
transaction occurring and elect to make pro forma adjustments as though they had occurred, any such
transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to
have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered or such Relevant Transaction Date and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such
agreement and before the consummation of such transaction. To the extent the date of determination of a basket
or ratio is tested prior to the date of consummation of a transaction, such basket or ratio shall be deemed utilized
to the same extent until the earlier of the date of consummation of such transaction or the date such transaction is
terminated or expires without consummation, except that in the case of an acquisition, merger or consolidation,
any calculation for purposes other than Incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or the making of Restricted
Payments (not related to such acquisition, merger or consolidation) shall not reflect such transaction until it has
been consummated.

For any relevant basket set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month
period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(1) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during such Annual Period
may be increased by: (i) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted

228


-----

amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the
Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (ii) an amount equal
to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in
such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry
**Back Amount”); and**

(2) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during such Annual Period is
increased in accordance with clause (1) above, any usage of such basket during such Annual Period shall be
deemed to be applied in the following order: (i) first, against the Carry Forward Amount; (ii) second, against
the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with
clause (1) above; and (iii) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable, continued
for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or
the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained
in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
indebtedness under any Hedging Obligations or Subordinated Shareholder Funding or ancillary facilities
made available under the Revolving Credit Facility) by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or
the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now
exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and, in each case, either the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has
been so accelerated, and such payment default and acceleration are continuing, aggregates the greater of (i)
65% of Consolidated EBITDA and (ii) €90.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Parent Security Provider, the Issuer or a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating the greater of (i) 65%
of Consolidated EBITDA and (ii) €90.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company
has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days
after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess
of (i) 65% of Consolidated EBITDA and (ii) €90.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full
of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the
Issuer shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid, or unenforceable and any such Default
continues for 10 days, in each case, which is materially adverse to Noteholders’ interest as a whole under
the Note Documents;

229


-----

(8) any Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid, materially
adverse to Noteholders’ interest as a whole or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor
denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Notes Guarantee and any such Default continues for
10 days which is materially adverse to Noteholders’ interest as a whole under the Notes Documents; and

(9) failure by the Issuer, any Parent or Restricted Subsidiary to provide security over the Collateral as described
above under the caption “—Security—General” and such Event of Default continues for 30 days.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer
of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time
specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. A notice of
Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration
or to take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default may not be given with respect to
any action taken or any event which has occurred and been reported to the Noteholders by the Trustee or reported
publicly more than two years prior to such notice of Default, notice of acceleration or other instruction to the
Trustee.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under
the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders
shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the
Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because
an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the
declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default
triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of
the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full,
within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and
(2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became
due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Any notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of
Default under the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under
the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first
paragraph of this section or direction to take (or refrain from taking) any other action with respect to an alleged
Default or Event of Default the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or
more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such
Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is a nominee of Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not, Net
Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a
notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise
ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. The principal amount of the outstanding Notes held by any Directing
Holder that does not provide a Position Representation in respect of any Noteholder Direction shall be deemed to
be zero for the purposes of both the numerator and denominator in determining whether any requisite proportion
of Holders of Notes have given the Trustee a particular instruction in respect of the Notes. In addition, each
Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such
other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such
Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification
_Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee, any Position_
Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the
Notes in lieu of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or its nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of
its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (which shall also be
provided to any such Holder) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to

230


-----

believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification
Covenant and (ii) has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such
Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event
of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of
Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be
automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee
shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant or
(ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with
respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed
pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in
such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the
participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such
Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such
Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to
have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such
Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act
thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such
Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be
permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing
Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the
Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such
Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The
Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it
in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made
therein.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or
existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or
Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the
right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue
the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to it against
any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer
of security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will
be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct

231


-----

of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all
losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default
occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give
notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a
Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold
notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (or 150 days for the
fiscal year ending on December 31, 2021), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of
any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the
Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which
would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect
thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (A) if a Default (including an Event of Default) has occurred but is no longer
continuing (a “Cured Default”), any other Default or Event of Default which would not have arisen but for the
Cured Default having occurred shall be deemed not to be continuing automatically upon, and simultaneous with
the remedy, cure or waiver of the Cured Default, (B) if a Default (including an Event of Default) occurs for a
failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate, notice or other document in connection with another
default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is remedied or waived, such Default (including
an Event of Default) for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate, notice or other document or
information in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (C) any
Default (including an Event of Default) for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant
“Reports” herein, or otherwise to deliver any notice, certificate or other document, as applicable, even though
such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture or any other Notes Document shall be
deemed to be cured and remedied upon the delivery of any such report or statements or information required by
such covenant or notice, certificate or other document or performance of such obligation, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture or any other Notes Document.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunding to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for
the Trustee to take certain actions, steps or proceedings in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such
circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and
it will be for Holders to take action, steps or proceedings directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to
certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without the consent of
Holders holding not less than 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected, then
outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the proportion of the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be
redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts, if any,
on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such
payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a

232


-----

way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer or the applicable
Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Indenture or the applicable Security Documents;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
clauses (1) through (10) of this sentence,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that does
not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under
the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of
the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “Certain Covenants—Additional
_Notes Guarantees”, to add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit_
of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Notes
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect
thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or
amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement or the Notes to any
provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the
_Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the_
Escrow Agreement or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to
the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor
of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility, in any
property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect on the
Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the
benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

233


-----

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in
connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require,
the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Luxembourg in a daily newspaper
with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Such notice of any
amendment, supplement and waiver may also be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or
controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding.

**Meeting of Holders of Notes**

All meetings of Holders of the Notes will be held in accordance with Italian applicable laws and regulations.

In addition to and without prejudice to the provisions described above under the caption “—Amendments and
_Waivers”, in accordance with the provisions set forth under the Italian Civil Code, the Indenture will include_
provisions for the convening of meetings of the Holders of the Notes to consider any matter affecting their
interests, including, without limitation, the modification or abrogation by extraordinary resolution of any
provisions of the Notes or the Indenture. A meeting may be convened either (i) by the Board of Directors of the
Issuer, (ii) by the Noteholders’ Representative (as defined below) or (iii) upon request by holders of at least 5.0%
of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

In accordance with the Italian Civil Code, the vote required to pass a resolution by a meeting of the Holders of
Notes will be (i) in the case of the first meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of more than
one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, and (ii) in the case of the second and any
further adjourned meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of at least two-thirds of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes so present or represented at such meeting. Any such second or further
adjourned meeting will be validly held if there are one or more persons present that hold or represent Holders of
more than one-third of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes; provided, however, that the
Issuer’s bylaws may provide for a higher quorum (to the extent permitted under Italian law). Certain proposals,
as set out under Article 2415 paragraph 1, item 2, and paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (namely, the
amendment of the economic terms and conditions of the Notes) may only be approved by an extraordinary
resolution passed at a meeting of Holders of the Notes (including any adjourned meeting) by one or more persons
present that hold or represent holders of not less than one-half of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes.

With respect to the matters set forth in the second paragraph under “—Amendments and Waivers”, and to the
extent permitted under Italian law, the Indenture will contractually increase the percentage of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes otherwise required by Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code to pass an extraordinary
resolution with respect to such matters from 50% to 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees— The
_Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all holders of the_
_Notes with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes”. Any_
resolution duly passed at any such meeting shall be binding on all the holders of the Notes, whether or not such
holder was present at such meeting or voted to approve such resolution. To the extent provided by the Italian
Civil Code, the resolutions passed by a meeting of Holders of the Notes can be challenged by Holders pursuant to
Articles 2377 and 2379 of the Italian Civil Code.

The Indenture will provide that the provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” will be in
addition to, and not in substitution of, the provisions described under the caption “—Amendments and Waivers”.
As such and notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement and/or waiver, in addition to complying
with the provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” must also comply with the other
provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers”.

234


-----

**Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative**

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of the Notes
on the Issue Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of the Holders of the
Notes of the initial appointment as of the Issue Date of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security
representative (rappresentante per le garanzie) pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil
Code (the “Security Representative”) in order to create and grant in its favor security interests and guarantees
securing and guaranteeing the Notes and entitle it to exercise in the name and on behalf of the Holders of the
Notes all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to such security
interests and guarantees. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture each holder of the Notes from time to time, by
accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch as Security Representative.

Moreover, a representative of the Holders of the Notes (rappresentante comune) (the “Noteholders’
**Representative”) may be appointed pursuant to Articles 2415 and 2417 of the Italian Civil Code by the Holders**
of the Notes in order to represent the interests of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2418 of the Italian
Civil Code as well as to give effect to resolutions passed at a meeting of the Holders of the Notes. If the
Noteholders’ Representative is not appointed by a meeting of the Holders of the Notes, the Noteholders’
Representative shall be appointed by a decree of the Court where the Issuer has its registered office upon request
by one or more Holders of the Notes or upon request by the directors of the Issuer. The Noteholders’
Representative remains appointed for a maximum period of three financial years but may be subsequently
reappointed thereafter.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described under
“Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) and
“Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default”
above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the
bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant
**defeasance”).**

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Issuer and Significant
Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated
European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

235


-----

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably
require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for
in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the
Principal Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity
within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Principal Paying Agent in the name, and
at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another
entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose), money or euro-denominated European Government
Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal,
premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to
the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other
sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the
funds deposited towards the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and
(5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect
that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on
any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2)
and (3)).

If requested in writing by the Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or
pursuant to the applicable Officer’s Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed,
designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the
Holders prior to the applicable redemption date, provided, however, that Holders shall have received at least
three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of
redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable
redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or
any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a Global Note deposited with a
common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as
participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system.
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be liable to any Holder by virtue of the Issuer instructing the Trustee
or the Paying Agent to make an early distribution of funds as described in this paragraph.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer

236


-----

of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the
Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received
written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the
same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the
Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee, the Security Agent or any Agent will be permitted to engage in
other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to
meet certain eligibility requirements or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or
bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes expenses
incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange so require, notices with respect to the Notes of the Issuer will be published in a daily newspaper
with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or if, in the opinion of
the Issuer such publication is not practicable, in an English language newspaper having general circulation in
Europe. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes
will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Such notices may also be published
on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) in lieu of publication in the Luxemburger
_Wort so long as the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange allow._

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, notices to
Holders of the Notes may be delivered via Euroclear and Clearstream in lieu of notice via registered mail.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will
be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the
Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if
any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount
received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or
order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by
any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will
only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which

237


-----

the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of
that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it
is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or
the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify the recipient or the
Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the
Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used)
the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent
cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a
waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Guarantee, or to
the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit
the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. There can be no assurance that the application to list the
Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes on the Euro MTF Market
will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the
United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest,
Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not
be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes, the
Issuer will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of

the relevant date of calculation on a consolidated basis.

“Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of
(x) Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage at such date to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA
for the period of the four most recent fiscal quarters (or other Relevant Period) ending prior to the date of such

in the definition of Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (including as to Indebtedness which shall or shall not
be given effect to in such pro forma calculations, mutatis mutandis and, for the avoidance of doubt, references in
such definition to “Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio” shall be deemed to be references to “Consolidated

In the event that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases,
redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness or has caused any Reserved Indebtedness Amount to
be deemed to be Incurred subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio is made (for the purpose of this definition, the “Calculation Date”), then
the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer) to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or
other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable reference period if it would otherwise be included in Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio; provided, however, that (other than in connection with making any Restricted Payment pursuant
to clauses (18) and (22) of the fourth paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments”) the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (unless or except to the_
extent elected otherwise by the Issuer in respect of any particular calculation) (i) any Indebtedness Incurred on
the Calculation Date pursuant to the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio pursuant to_
clause (5)(ii)(B) in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or (ii) the

Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to such reference
period and on or prior to the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on the Calculation Date, shall be given
_pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer and may include anticipated synergies, cost_
savings and operating expense reductions, operating cost improvements, revenue increases, revenue
enhancements and any other expense and cost reductions or (in each case) similar) as if they had occurred
on the first day of the reference period; provided that, if definitive documentation has been entered into with
respect to a Purchase that is part of the transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated
EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase (including
anticipated synergies, cost savings and operating expense reductions, operating cost improvements, revenue
increases, revenue enhancements and any other expense and cost reductions or (in each case) similar) as if
such Purchase had occurred on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been
consummated as of the date of determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with GAAP, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business
or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, shall be
excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period (taking into
account anticipated synergies, cost savings and operating expense reductions, operating cost improvements,
revenue increases, revenue enhancements and any other expense and cost reductions or (in each case)
similar resulting from any such disposal, as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with
GAAP, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and
ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis
as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the obligations
giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a Restricted
Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest expense
on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the
applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such
Indebtedness, and if any Indebtedness is not denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that
Indebtedness for purposes of the calculation of Consolidated Total Net Leverage shall be treated in
accordance with GAAP); and

(7) the reasonably anticipated full run rate effect of synergies, cost savings and operating expense reductions,
operating cost improvements, revenue increases, revenue enhancements and any other expense and cost
reductions or (in each case) similar (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) projected to result from
actions taken or commenced or expected to be taken or committed to be taken by the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries shall be included as though such synergies, cost savings and operating expense reductions,
operating cost improvements, revenue increases, revenue enhancements and any other expense and cost
reductions or (in each case) similar had been achieved on the first day of the relevant period, net of the
amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such actions, and provided that such adjustments
are not duplicative of any of those items already included for such period.

Interest Expense and Consolidated Net Income, calculations will be determined in accordance with the
terms set forth above and those defined terms.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”).

The Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S (will initially be represented by one or more
global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and,
together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear
Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking S.A.
(“Clearstream”) and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary. Except as set forth
below, each series of the Notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of €100,000
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against
payment in immediately available funds.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together
with the Rule 144A Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants or
otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Indenture governing the Notes and any
applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream
will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in
their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances
described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical
delivery of certificated Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical
delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to
own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of BookEntry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/
or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear,
Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to
exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominee), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note
from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary will
surrender such Global Note to the Paying Agent for a cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the
Common Depositary will request the Paying Agent to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note
to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the
amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global
Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream,
if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other
basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that, subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent who will make payment to or to the

272


-----

order of the Common Depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all
such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described
under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be
made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts,” the Issuer will pay
additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes
or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder
or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may
be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary
practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or
any of their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the Common Depositary
(or its nominee)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any of
their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on
account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be paid to
holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euros.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither the Issuer nor the relevant Trustee nor the Initial
Purchasers nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for
any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding
effected in connection with any such payment.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to
which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the
“Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may
change from time to time.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers as discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of
the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the

273


-----

Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any
other exemption (if available) under the Securities Act.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Euro MTF Market. Transfers of
interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary
way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures
may change from time to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, nor
any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or
their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes if:

- Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the
Global Notes, and the Issuer fails to appoint a successor;

- Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

- the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is
to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of BookEntry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes (subject to receipt of the same from the
Issuer), registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based
upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend
is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and
any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a
holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered
Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in
respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as
applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing,
packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees
normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its authenticating

274


-----

agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements
are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to
furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them
may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a
Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered
Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the d’Wort). Payment
of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the
office of the Paying Agent in Luxembourg so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

**_Initial Settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional euro bonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary Market Trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of
any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special Timing Considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving
Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to
transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day,
may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is
used, or Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**_Clearing Information_**

The Issuer expects that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and
Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes numbers for the Notes are set
out under “Listing and General Information.”

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a
matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement
systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor their
respective agents take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to
contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

275


-----

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders.
Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that,
under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the relevant Trustee requests any action by owners of
Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is
entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the
relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect
participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of
beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

276

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and the Code impose certain
requirements on employee benefit plans subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and
other plans and arrangements that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), such as individual retirement accounts, as well as on
entities that are deemed to hold “plan assets” of such employee benefit plans, plans, accounts or arrangements
within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (collectively,
“Plans”), and certain duties on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to such Plans. Under ERISA and
the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Plan
or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other
compensation to such a Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Plan.

A fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in order to determine if the investment satisfies the
fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and
diversification and delegation of control.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Plan
and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” within the meaning of ERISA or “disqualified persons”
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or
administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages
in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and/or other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and
the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel
regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code or any Similar Law (as defined below) to such an investment, and to confirm that such
purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of
an applicable requirement of ERISA.

Non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of
ERISA) and certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are
substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code (“Similar Law”) (collectively, “Similar Law Plans”). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with
their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any
exemptive relief under any such law or regulations.

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Guarantors or any other
party to the transactions contemplated by this Offering Memorandum or any of their respective affiliates (the
“Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase
or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice
based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to
purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with
respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the
Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific
purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser
on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Exemptions**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things,
whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest
or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and a party in interest or a
disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person,
of any Plan assets. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by a Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is
considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and
is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this
regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding

277


-----

of Notes by a Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such
Notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the Plan. Depending on the satisfaction
of certain conditions which may include the identity of the Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire or hold
the Notes on behalf of a Plan, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code or certain
prohibited transaction class exemptions issued by the United States Department of Labor, including Prohibited
Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an independent “qualified
professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate
accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to
investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an
in-house asset manager) (collectively, the “Class Exemptions”) could provide an exemption from the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. However, there can be no assurance that any of
these Class Exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction
involving the Notes.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that, for so long as it holds such Note, (A) either (i) it is not, and no portion of
the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes
assets of any Plan or Similar Law Plan, or (ii)(x) the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes (or any
interest therein) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Law, and (y) none of the
Transaction Parties is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code) to any Plan or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Plan with respect to the decision
to purchase or hold the Notes or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a
fiduciary capacity with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes, and (B) it will not sell or otherwise
transfer such Notes or any interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make
these same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase and holding of such Note or
any interest therein.

**The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity**
**of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited**
**transactions, it is particularly important that each Plan fiduciary (and each fiduciary for a Similar Law**
**Plan) consult with its legal advisor concerning the potential consequences to the plan under ERISA, the**
**Code or such Similar Laws of an investment in the Notes. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a**
**representation by any Transaction Party or any of their respective affiliates or representatives that such**
**an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan or that**
**such investment is appropriate for any such Plan.**

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS OECD COMMON REPORTING STANDARDS**

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has developed a common reporting
standard (“CRS”) to achieve a comprehensive and multilateral automatic exchange of information on a global
basis. A number of jurisdictions (including Italy) signed the OECD’s multilateral competent authority agreement
(“Agreement”) to automatically exchange information under the CRS.

The CRS requires certain financial institutions to report information regarding certain accounts (which may
include the Notes credited to such accounts) to their local tax authority and follow related due diligence
procedures. A jurisdiction that has signed the Agreement may provide this information to other jurisdictions that
have signed the Agreement.

Consequently, holders of the Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications to any
financial institution resident in a jurisdiction that has signed the Agreement (including Italy) through which
payments on the Notes are made.

The holders of Notes who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisors on the
individual impact of CRS on their position.

**CERTAIN ITALIAN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The statements herein regarding Italian taxation are based on the laws and published practices of the Italian tax
authorities in effect in Italy as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any changes in law
and interpretation occurring after such date, which changes could be made on a retroactive basis. The Issuer will
not update this summary to reflect changes in laws and if such changes occur the information in this summary
may become invalid. The following is a general summary only of certain material Italian tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposal of Notes for Italian resident and non-Italian resident beneficial owners only
and it is not intended to be, nor should it be constructed to be, legal or tax advice. The following summary does
not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations which may be relevant to make a decision
to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all
categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers in securities or commodities) may be subject to additional
or special rules. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors concerning the
overall tax consequences of their acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes and receiving payments on interest,
principal and/or other amounts under the Notes, including, in particular, the effect of any state, regional and local
tax laws. In any case, Italian legal concepts may not be identical to the concepts described by the same English
term as they exist under terms of different jurisdictions and any legal concept expressed by using the relevant
Italian term shall prevail over the corresponding concept expressed in English terms.

**Tax Treatment of the Notes issued by the Issuer**

**_Tax Treatment of Interest_**

Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of 1 April 1996 (“Decree No. 239”) sets out the applicable regime regarding
the tax treatment of interest, premium and other income (including the difference between the redemption
amount and the issue price and any relevant make-whole premium, hereinafter collectively referred to as
“Interest”) deriving from Notes falling within the category of bonds or similar securities (obbligazioni o titoli
_similari alle obbligazioni), pursuant to Article 44 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of 22 December 1986, as_
amended and supplemented (“Decree No. 917”), according to which securities qualify as titoli similari alle
_obbligazioni (securities similar to bonds), if they:_

(i) incorporate an unconditional obligation to pay at maturity an amount not lower than their nominal value or
principal amount; and

(ii) attribute to the holders no direct or indirect right to control or participate in the management of the Issuer or
in the management of the business in respect of which the Notes have been issued; and

(iii) not provide for a remuneration which is entirely linked to profits of the Issuer, or other companies belonging
to the same group or to the business in respect of which the Notes have been issued.

Decree No. 239 regulates the tax treatment of Interest related to bonds or similar securities to the extent they are,
_inter alia:_

(A) issued by companies whose shares are listed on a regulated market or on a multi-lateral trading platform of
EU Member States and of the States party to the EEA Agreement included in the list provided for by Italian
Ministerial Decree dated 4 September 1996, as amended from time to time, or, as from the tax year in which
the Ministerial Decree to be issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, let. c) of Decree No. 239 is effective,
included in the list therein provided (the “White List”); or

279


-----

(B) listed on a regulated market or on a multilateral trading platform of EU Member States and of the States
party to the EEA Agreement included in the White List

(C) subscribed, transferred to and held by qualified investors (as defined under Article 100 of the Italian
Financial Services Act) only.

_Italian resident Noteholders_

_Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

Where the beneficial owner of the Notes (a “Noteholder”) is an Italian resident and is:

(a) an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected (unless he has
opted for the application of the risparmio gestito regime—see “—Tax Treatment of Capital Gains”—or he
has included the Notes in a long-term savings account—see “Long-term Savings Accounts”—);

(b) a partnership (other than a societa` in nome collettivo or societa` in accomandita semplice or similar
partnership) or a de facto partnership not carrying out commercial activities (società semplice) or
professional association;

(c) a non-commercial private or public institution, trusts not carrying out mainly or exclusively commercial
activities, the Italian State and public and territorial entities; or

(d) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation,

then Interest derived from the Notes, and accrued during the relevant holding period, is subject to a withholding
tax, referred to as “imposta sostitutiva,” levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or obtained upon
disposal of the Notes) unless the relevant Italian Resident Noteholder holds the Notes in a discretionary
investment portfolio managed by an authorized intermediary and, under certain conditions, has validly opted for
the application of the “Risparmio gestito” regime provided for by Article 7 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 461
of November 21, 1997 (“Decree No. 461”). All the above categories are qualified as “net recipients.”

_Noteholders Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_

In the event that the Italian resident Noteholders described under clauses (a) and (c) above are engaged in an
entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax.
Interest will be subject to 26% imposta sostitutiva on a provisional basis and will then be included in the relevant
Italian resident noteholder’s annual income tax return. As a consequence, Interest will be subject to the ordinary
income tax and imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a credit that can be offset against the income tax due.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent establishment in
Italy of a foreign company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are deposited with an
Intermediary (as defined below), Interest from the Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva. They must,
however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and are therefore subject to the Italian
corporate tax (“IRES”) levied at the rate of 24% although certain surcharges may apply) and, in certain
circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, the Italian regional tax on productive activities
(“IRAP”) generally levied at the base rate of 3.9%, even though regional surcharges may apply).

_Long-term Savings Accounts_

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident
individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are effectively connected
or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and No. 103 of February 10,
1996, may be exempt from any income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on Interest if the Notes are
included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets
the requirements set forth by Article 1 (100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 (“Finance Act 2017”),
by Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of 30 December 2018 (“Finance Act 2019”) and, for long-term
individual savings accounts established from 1 January 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law Decree No. 124 of 26
October 2019. (“Law Decree No. 124”) converted into Law with amendments by Law No. 157 of 19 December
2019, as amended and supplemented from time to time.

_Real Estate Investment Funds_

Payments of Interest deriving from the Notes made to Italian resident real estate collective investment funds
(“RE Funds”) and real estate Società di Investimento a Capitale Fisso (“RE SICAFs”) established pursuant to
Article 37 of the Legislative Decree of 25 January 1994, n. 58, as amended and supplemented, and article 14-bis
of Law No. 86 of 25 January 1994, provided that the Notes, together with the coupons relating thereto, are timely
deposited directly or indirectly with an Intermediary (as defined below) are subject neither to imposta sostitutiva
nor to any other income tax at the level of the RE Funds or RE SICAFs. However, a withholding or substitute tax

280


-----

of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of
distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions and depending on
the status and percentage of participation held, income realized by RE Funds and RE SICAFs is attributed to the
relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands irrespective of its actual collection and in proportion to the
percentage of ownership of units/shares on a tax transparency basis.

_Funds and SICAV and Non-Real Estate SICAFs_

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is an open-ended or closed-ended collective investment fund other than RE
Funds (a “Fund”) or Società di Investimento a Capitale Variabile (“SICAV”) or a non-real estate SICAF
established in Italy and either (i) the Fund or SICAV or non-real estate SICAF or (ii) its manager is subject to the
supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below),
Interest accrued during the holding period on the Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be
included in the management results of the Fund, SICAV or non-real estate SICAF. The Fund, the SICAV or the
non-real estate SICAF will not be subject to taxation on such management results, but a withholding or substitute
tax of 26% will instead apply in certain circumstances to income realized by certain categories of unitholders or
shareholders (as applicable) in case of distribution, redemption or sales of the units or shares.

_Pension Funds_

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by article 17 of the
Legislative Decree of 5 December 2005, n. 252) and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined
below), Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to imposta
_sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the pension fund accrued at the end of the tax period (which will_
be subject to a 20% substitute tax on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax
year).

Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period) and several limitations (including amount and
composition of the capital investment), Interest relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of
the Pension Fund Tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo
_termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraphs 100 to 114 of Finance Act 2017, by_
Article 1 (210-215) of Finance Act 2019 as implemented by the Ministerial Decree of April 30, 2019, and, for
long-term individual savings account established from 1 January 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law Decree No. 124,
as amended and supplemented from time to time.

_Enforcement of Imposta Sostitutiva_

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by Italian resident banks, società di
_intermediazione mobiliare (“SIM”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del Risparmio (“SGR”),_
stockbrokers and other entities identified by a decree of the Ministry of Finance or Italian permanent
establishment of equivalent foreign entities (each, an “Intermediary”).

An Intermediary must:

(a) (i) be resident in Italy, or (ii) be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial
intermediary, or (iii) be an entity or a company not resident in Italy, acting through a system of centralized
administration of securities and directly connected with the Italian Tax Authorities having appointed an
Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239; and

(b) intervene, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes.

For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other
act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a
change in Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited.

Where the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by the
relevant Intermediary paying interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are
Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are
effectively connected are entitled to deduct the suffered imposta sostitutiva from income taxes due.

**Non-Italian Resident Noteholders**

Where the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident, payments of Interest in respect of the Notes issued by the Issuer
will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva at the rate of 26% provided that:

(a) the payments are made to non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes with no permanent
establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected; and

281


-----

(b) such beneficial owners are residents, for tax purposes, in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange
of information with Italy listed in the White List; and

(c) all the requirements and procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules, as
subsequently amended, in order to benefit from the exemption from imposta sostitutiva are timely met and
complied with.

Decree No. 239 also provides for additional exemptions from the imposta sostitutiva for payments of Interest in
respect of the Notes made to:

(a) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into
force in Italy;

(b) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a country which allows for a
satisfactory exchange of information with Italy listed in the White List, and provided that they timely file
with the relevant depositary an appropriate self-declaration of being an institutional investor; or

(c) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must be the beneficial owners of the payments
of Interest (institutional investors not subject to tax are deemed to be beneficial owners of the payments of
Interest by operation of law) and must:

(a) deposit in due time, directly or indirectly, the Notes with a resident bank or a SIM or a permanent
establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or a SIM or with a non-Italian resident entity or
company participating in a centralized securities management system which is in contact, via computer,
with the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance having appointed an Italian representative for the
purposes of Decree No. 239 (Euroclear and Clearstream are such a depositary); and

(b) file with the relevant depository, in due time, a statement of the relevant Noteholder (auto-certificazione),
which remains valid until withdrawn or revoked, in which the Noteholder declares to be eligible to benefit
from the applicable exemption from imposta sostitutiva. This statement, which is not required for
international bodies or entities set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into
force in Italy nor in the case of foreign central banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the official
reserves of a foreign State, must comply with the requirements set forth by the Ministerial Decree of
12 December 2001.

Failure of a non-resident Noteholder to timely comply with the procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the
relevant implementation rules will result in the application of imposta sostitutiva on Interest payments to a
non-resident Noteholder.

Noteholders who are subject to the imposta sostitutiva might, nevertheless, be eligible for full or partial relief
under an applicable tax treaty between Italy and their country of residence, subject to timely filing of required
documentation provided by Measure of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency No. 2013/84404 of 10 July 2013.

**Payments Made by an Italian Resident Guarantor**

With respect to payments on the Notes made to Noteholders by an Italian resident Guarantor of the Notes, in
accordance with one interpretation of Italian tax law, any payment of liabilities equal to Interest and other
proceeds from the Notes (other than the repayment of principal) may be subject to a withholding tax at the rate of
26% levied as a final or provisional tax (“a titolo d’imposta o a titolo di acconto”) depending on the “status” and
the tax residence of the beneficial owner of the Notes, pursuant to Presidential Decree of 29 September 1973,
No. 600, as subsequently amended.

Double taxation treaties entered into by Italy may also apply, allowing for a lower (or, in certain cases, nil) rate
of withholding tax in case of payments to non-Italian resident Noteholders, subject to compliance with relevant
subjective and procedural requirements.

However, in accordance with an alternative interpretation, any such payment made by the Italian resident
Guarantor will be treated, in certain circumstances, as a payment by the Issuer and will thus be subject to the
Italian tax regime described above.

**Fungible Issues**

Pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 2 of Decree No. 239, where the relevant Issuer issues a new tranche of notes
forming part of a single series with a previous tranche of notes, for the purposes of calculating the amount of
Interest subject to imposta sostitutiva, the issue price of the new tranche of notes will be deemed to be the same

282


-----

amount as the issue price of the original tranche of notes. This rule applies where (a) the new tranche of notes is
issued within twelve months of the issue date of the previous tranche of notes and (b) the difference between the
issue price of the new tranche of notes and that of the original tranche of notes does not exceed 1% multiplied by
the number of years of the duration of the notes.

**Tax Treatment of Capital Gains**

**_Italian Resident Noteholders_**

_Noteholders Not Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_

Where an Italian resident Noteholder (i) is an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the
Notes are connected, (ii) a non-commercial partnership (società semplice) or (iii) a non-commercial private or
public institution, any capital gain realized by such Noteholder from the sale or redemption of the Notes would
be subject to a substitute tax provided for by Legislative Decree 21 November 1997, No. 461 as subsequently
amended (the “Decree No. 461”), levied at the rate of 26%. Under certain conditions and limitations, noteholders
may set off any capital losses with their capital gains.

In respect of the application of the substitute tax on capital gains, taxpayers may opt for any of the three regimes
described below.

_Tax Declaration Regime_

Under the “tax declaration regime” (regime della dichiarazione), which is the default regime for Italian resident
individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the 26% substitute tax on
capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss of the
same kind) realized by the Italian resident individual holding the Notes, during any given tax year. Italian
resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall
capital gains realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss of the same kind, in their annual
tax return and pay the substitute tax on such gains of the same kind together with any balance of income tax due
for such year. Capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in
any of the four succeeding tax years.

_Risparmio Amministrato Regime_

As an alternative to the tax declaration regime, Italian resident individual Noteholders holding the Notes not in
connection with an entrepreneurial activity may elect to pay the substitute tax separately on capital gains realized
on each sale or redemption of the Notes (risparmio amministrato regime provided for by Article 6 of Decree
No. 461). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to:

i. the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial intermediary (or
permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediaries); and

ii. a valid express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being timely made in writing by the relevant
Noteholder.

The depository is responsible for accounting for the substitute tax in respect of capital gains realized on each sale
or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net
of any incurred capital loss. The depository must also pay the substitute tax on capital gains to the Italian tax
authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to
the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato
regime, any possible capital loss resulting from a sale or redemption of the Notes may be deducted only from
capital gains subsequently realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the
following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to
declare the capital gains in the annual tax return.

_Risparmio Gestito Regime_

In the risparmio gestito regime, any capital gains realized by Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in
connection with an entrepreneurial activity and who have entrusted the management of their financial assets
(including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary, will be included in the computation of the annual increase in
value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be
paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Any depreciation of the managed assets accrued at the tax yearend may be carried forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four
succeeding tax years. The Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains realized in its annual tax return.

283


-----

Subject to certain limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment) and requirements
(including a minimum holding period), capital gains in respect of Notes realized upon sale, transfer or
redemption by Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity
may be exempt from any income taxation, including the 26% substitute tax on capital gains, if the Notes are
included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) pursuant
Article 1, paragraphs 100 – 114, of Finance Act 2017, by Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of Finance Act
2019, and for long-term individual saving accounts established from January 1, 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law
Decree No. 124, as amended and supplemented from time to time.

_Noteholders Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_

Any capital gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be treated as part of taxable income
(and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of the
production for IRAP purposes) if realized by (i) an Italian company, or a similar commercial entity; (ii) an Italian
resident commercial partnership; (iii) an Italian permanent establishment of foreign entities to which the Notes
are effectively connected; or, (iv) an Italian resident individual engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which
the Notes are connected.

_RE Funds and RE SICAF_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is an Italian RE Fund or an Italian RE SICAF are exempt from
any income tax at the level of the RE Fund or RE SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax will apply in
certain circumstances at the rate of 26% to income realized by unitholders or shareholders of the Re Fund/RE
SICAF on distributions made by Italian RE Funds/RE SICAF or upon redemption or disposal of the units or the
shares (as applicable).

Subject to certain conditions and depending on the status and percentage of participation held, income realized
by RE Funds and RE SICAFs is attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands, irrespective
of its actual collection and in proportion to the percentage of ownership of units on a tax transparency basis.

_Funds and SICAV_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is a non-real estate Italian Fund or a non-real estate SICAF or a
SICAV will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period which
is exempt from any income tax. A 26% withholding tax will apply in certain circumstances, to distributions by
the Italian Fund or non-real estate SICAF or SICAV or received by certain categories of unitholders or
shareholders upon redemption or disposal or sale of the units or the shares (as applicable).

_Pension Funds_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by
Article 17 of Legislative Decree of 5 December 2005, n. 252) will be included in the result of the relevant
portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to a 20% substitute tax. Subject to certain
conditions and requirements (including minimum holding period requirement) and several limitations (including
amount and composition of the capital investment), income relating to the Notes may be excluded from the
taxable base of the Pension Fund Tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano individuale
_di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Article 1 (100-114) of the Finance Act_
2017, by Article 1 (210-215) of the Finance Act 2019 as implemented by the Ministerial Decree of April 30,
2019, and, for long-term individual savings accounts established from January 1, 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law
Decree No. 124, as amended and supplemented from time to time.

_Non-Italian Resident Noteholders_

A 26% final substitute tax on capital gains may be payable on capital gains realized upon the sale, transfer or
redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in Italy
to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy.

However, pursuant to Article 23, paragraph 1, let. f), of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-Italian
resident Noteholders, without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected,
from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets in Italy
or abroad are not subject to the substitute tax on capital gains, subject to timely filling of required documentation
(in particular, a self-declaration that the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes) with Italian qualified
intermediaries (or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) with which the Notes are

284


-----

deposited, even if the Notes are held in Italy and regardless of the provisions set forth by any applicable double
tax treaty. Italian tax authorities have recently clarified (Italian Revenue Agency Circular Letter No. 32 of
December 23, 2020) that the notion of multilateral trading facility (MTF) under EU Directive 2014/65/CE (so
called MiFID II) can be assimilated to that of “regulated market” for income tax purposes; conversely, organized
trading facilities (OTF), not falling in the definition of MTF under MiFID II, cannot be assimilated to “regulated
market” for income tax purposes.

Pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 5 of Decree No. 461, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders
from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and held in Italy, even if not traded on
regulated markets, are not subject to the substitute tax on capital gains, provided that the effective beneficiary is:

(a) resident, for tax purposes, in a State, in a country which recognizes the Italian fiscal authorities’ right to an
adequate exchange of information, included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a
taxpayer in its own country of establishment, and does not have a permanent establishment in Italy to which
the Notes are effectively connected;

(b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into
force in Italy;

(c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a country which is listed in
the White List, and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate self-declaration
of being an institutional investor; or

(d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes
are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the
_risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on_
capital gains will apply upon condition that they file in time with the authorized financial intermediary an
appropriate self-declaration – complying with the requirements set forth by the Ministerial Decree of
12 December 2001 – stating that they are resident, for tax purposes, in a country which is listed in the White List.

If none of the above conditions above is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the
sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets may be
subject to the substitute tax at the current rate of 26%. However, non-Italian resident Noteholders might benefit
from an applicable tax treaty with Italy providing that capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the
Notes are to be taxed only in the tax residence country of the recipient.

Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes
are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the
_risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on_
capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-Italian residents file in time with the authorized financial
intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the competent tax
authorities of their country of residence.

The risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian resident
persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign
intermediary), but non-Italian resident Noteholders retain the right to waive this regime.

**Italian Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax**

Pursuant to Law No. 346 of October 31, 1990 and No. 286 of November 24, 2006, as subsequently amended,
transfers of Notes by reason of gift, donation or succession of Italian residents and of non-Italian residents, but in
such latter case limited to assets held within the Italian territory (which, for presumption of law, includes bonds
issued by Italian resident issuers) are subject to Italian gift and inheritance tax as follows:

(a) 4% for transfers in favor of the spouse and direct descendants or direct ancestors exceeding, for each
beneficiary, a threshold of €1.0 million;

(b) 6% for transfers in favor of siblings exceeding, for each beneficiary, a threshold of €0.1 million;

(c) 6% for transfers in favor of relatives up to the fourth degree and to all relatives in law in direct line and to
other relatives in law up to the third degree, on the entire value of the inheritance or the gift; and

(d) 8% for transfers in favor of any other person or entity, on the entire value of the inheritance or the gift.

If the heir/heiress and/or the donee is a person with a severe disability pursuant to Law n. 104 of February 5,
1992, inheritance tax or gift tax is applied to the extent that the value of the inheritance or gift exceeds
€1.5 million.

285


-----

With respect to Notes listed on a regulated market, the relevant value for inheritance and gift tax purposes is the
average stock exchange price of the last quarter preceding the date of the succession or of the gift (including any
accrued interest). With respect to unlisted Notes, the value for inheritance tax and gift tax purposes is generally
determined by reference to the value of listed debt securities having similar features or based on certain elements
as presented in the Italian tax law.

The transfer of financial instruments as a result of death is exempt from inheritance tax when such financial
instruments are included in a long-term saving account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that
meets the requirements set forth in Article 1 (100-114) of the Finance Act 2017, by Article 1 (210-215) of the
Finance Act 2019, as implemented by the Ministerial Decree of April 30, 2019 and, for long-term individual
savings accounts established from January 1, 2020, by Article 13 bis of Italian Law Decree No. 124, as amended
and supplemented from time to time.

Moreover, an anti-avoidance rule is provided in the case of a gift of assets, such as the Notes, whose sale for
consideration would give rise to capital gains to be subject to the substitute tax provided for by Decree No. 461,
as subsequently amended. In particular, if the donee sells the securities for consideration within five years from
their receipt as a gift, the latter is required to pay the relevant substitute tax as if the gift had never taken place.

**Stamp Taxes and Duties**

According to Article 13, paragraph 2-ter of the tariff Part I attached to Presidential Decree No. 642 of
October 26, 1972, as amended and supplemented, a proportional stamp duty applies on a yearly basis at the rate
of 0.20% on communications and reports that Italian financial intermediaries periodically send to their clients in
relation to the financial products that are deposited with such intermediaries (the level of tax being determined in
proportion to the period of ownership). The Notes are included in the definition of financial products for these
purposes. Communications and reports are deemed to be sent at least once a year even if the Italian financial
intermediary is under no obligation to either draft or send such communications and reports. In this case, the
stamp duty is to be applied on December 31 of each year or in any case at the end of the relationship with the
client. At any rate, where no specific exemption applies, a minimum stamp tax of Euro 34.20 is due on a yearly
basis. The stamp duty applies on the market value or—in the absence of a market value—on the nominal value or
the redemption amount of any financial product or financial instruments or in the case that the nominal value or
redemption values cannot be determined, on the purchase value of any financial asset (including the Notes)
resulting from any periodic reporting communication issued by the Italian financial intermediary with which the
Notes are deposited (the tax being determined in proportion to the reporting period).

Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the Italian Ministry of Economy on
24 May 2012, the stamp duty applies to any investor who is a client (as defined in the regulations issued by the
Bank of Italy) of an entity that exercises in any form a banking, financial or insurance activity within the Italian
territory. The stamp duty cannot exceed €14,000 per year if the Notes are held by noteholders other than
individuals. Stamp duty applies both to Italian resident noteholders and to non-Italian resident noteholders, to the
extent that the Notes are held with an Italian-based financial intermediary (and not directly held by the
noteholders outside Italy, in which case Italian wealth tax (see below under “Wealth Tax”) applies to Italianresident noteholders only).

**Wealth Tax**

According to Article 13, para. 2-ter of the tariff Part I attached to Presidential Decree No. 642 of 26 October
1972, as introduced by Article 19 of Decree No. 201 of 6 December 2011, converted with amendments by Law
No. 214 of December 22, 2011 individuals, certain non-commercial entities, including trusts and foundations,
and so called società semplici (and similar partnerships pursuant to Article 5 of Decree No. 917), resident in Italy
for tax purposes holding financial assets— including the Notes—outside Italy are required to declare in its own
annual tax return and pay a wealth tax (“IVAFE”) at the rate of 0.20% (the tax being determined in proportion to
the period of ownership). The wealth tax applies on the market value at the end of the relevant year (or at the end
of the holding period) or, in the absence of market value, on the nominal value or redemption value of such
financial assets held outside Italy or in the case that the nominal value or redemption values cannot be
determined, on the purchase value of any financial asset. Taxpayers are permitted to deduct from the wealth tax a
tax credit equal to any equivalent wealth tax legitimately paid in the State where the financial assets are held (up
to the amount of IVAFE due).

Pursuant to the provision of Article 134 of Law Decree No. 34 of May 19, 2020, the wealth tax cannot exceed
€14,000 per year for taxpayers different from individuals.

286


-----

**Transfer tax**

Contracts relating to the transfer of securities are subject to the registration tax as follows:

(a) public deeds and notarized deeds (atti pubblici e scritture private autenticate) are subject to fixed
registration tax at rate of €200.00, and

(b) private deeds (scritture private non autenticate) are subject to fixed registration tax of €200.00 applicable
only in case of use (caso d’uso), reference in a subsequent registered deed (enunciazione) or voluntary
registration (volontaria registrazione).

**EU Savings Tax Directive and Implementation of the Automatic Exchange of Information in Italy**

On 10 November 2015, the Council of the European Union approved the Council Directive 2015/2060/EU
(published in the Official Journal of the EU on 18 November 2015) which has repealed the Council Directive
2003/48/EU (the “EU Savings Tax Directive”) from 1 January 2016 in the case of all Member States other than
Austria and from 1 January 2017 in the case of Austria. This was intended to prevent overlap between the EU
Savings Tax Directive and the new automatic exchange of information regime to be implemented under Council
Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive
2014/107/EU). The new regime under Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is in accordance with the
Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development in July 2014. Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is generally broader in scope than the
EU Saving Tax Directive, although it does not impose withholding taxes.

Italy has enacted Italian Law No. 95 of June 18, 2015 (“Law 95/2015”), implementing the CRS (and the
amended EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation) Italian Ministerial Decree dated December 28, 2015,
which has entered into force on January 1, 2016, has implemented Law 95/2015 and has provided for the
exchange of information starting from the calendar year 2016.

In the event that holders of the Notes hold the Notes through an Italian financial institution (as defined in the
Italian Ministerial Decree of December 28, 2015 implementing Law 95/2015), they may be required to provide
additional information to such financial institution to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Italian
implementation of the CRS.

**Italian Financial Transactions Tax**

Pursuant to Law No. 228 of 24 December 2012, Italian financial transaction tax (“FTT”) applies to (a) transfer of
ownership of shares and other participating securities issued by Italian resident companies or of financial
instruments representing the said shares and/or participating securities (irrespective of whether issued by Italian
resident issuers or not) (the “Relevant Securities”), (b) transactions on financial derivatives (i) the main
underlying assets of which are the Relevant Securities, or (ii) whose value depends mainly on one or more
Relevant Securities, as well as to (c) any transaction on certain securities (i) which allow to mainly purchase or
sell one or more Relevant Securities or (ii) implying a cash payment determined with main reference to one or
more Relevant Securities.

Securities could be included in the scope of application of the FTT if they meet the requirements set out above.
On the other hand, securities falling within the category of bonds (obbligazioni), such as the Notes, don’t meet
the requirements set out above and, consequently, are not included in the scope of the FTT.

Prospective holders of the Notes are strongly advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
possible application of financial transaction tax in countries other than Italy.

**Italian Tax Monitoring Obligations**

Italian resident individuals (and certain other entities) are required, in certain circumstances, to report in their
yearly income tax return (or, in case the income tax return is not due, in a proper form that must be filed within
the same time as prescribed for the income tax return), according to Legislative Decree No. 167 of 28 June 1990,
converted with amendments into law by Law No. 227 of 4 August 1990, as amended, for tax monitoring
purposes, the amount of securities, including notes, held abroad (or beneficially owned abroad under Italian antimoney laundering provisions). This also applies in the case that at the end of the tax year, securities are no longer
held by the above Italian resident individuals and entities.

However, the above reporting obligation is not required where (i) the securities are deposited for management
with qualified Italian financial intermediaries and with respect to contracts entered into through their
intervention, provided that the same intermediaries apply a withholding tax or imposta sostitutiva on any income

287


-----

derived from the securities or (ii) one of such intermediaries intervenes, also as a counterpart, in their transfer,
provided that income deriving from such financial assets has been subject to the applicable withholding tax or
substitute tax by the same intermediaries or (iii) the foreign financial investments are only composed by deposits
and/or bank accounts having an aggregate value not exceeding an €15,000.00 threshold throughout the year.

The requirement applies also where the persons above, being not the direct holder of the financial instruments,
are the beneficial owner of the instrument.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder
or Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below) and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than
U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This
discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change
or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively
in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings
from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a
contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the notes.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221
of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing
the Notes for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the
Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash). This
discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular
circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it
does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation:

- U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

- U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents living abroad

- persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;

- U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

- persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a
conversion transaction or other integrated investment;

- persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the
Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement;

- banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;

- real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;

- brokers, dealers or traders in securities;

- “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

- S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income
tax purposes (and investors therein);

- tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; and

- persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note who or that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District
of Columbia;

- an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

- a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and nor or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect
under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Notes that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership. If an entity
or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of
a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain
determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding the Notes and the partners in such
partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.

**THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.**
**INVESTORS** **SHOULD** **CONSULT** **THEIR** **TAX** **ADVISORS** **WITH** **RESPECT** **TO** **THE**
**APPLICATION OF** **THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR**
**SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND**
**DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING**
**ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S.**
**TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.**

**_Effect of the IPO Debt Pushdown Provisions_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under “Description of the
_Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown,” such change in the Issuer could result in a deemed exchange of the Notes for_
“new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. holders generally would recognize any
gain on such exchange (although any loss could be disallowed), and the “new” Notes could be treated as issued
with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes,” and “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”), the Issuer may be obligated to redeem_
the Notes for an amount in excess of their adjusted issue price, or may be obligated to make certain payments on
the Notes in excess of stated principal and interest. The Issuer believes that the Notes should not be treated as
contingent payment debt instruments due to the possibility of such a redemption occurring or such excess
payments being made. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the
proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position,
and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue
interest income at a rate different than their yield to maturity and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital
gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note. The
balance of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments.
U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the Notes of the
contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of stated interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes
and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S.
Holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S.
Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a
payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar
value of the foreign currency interest payment (determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is
received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S.
Holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such stated interest, but may
recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency so received.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who
otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in foreign currency that has accrued with

289


-----

respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such Euro denominated accrued stated
interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period
or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the
partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate such
accrued stated interest income into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest
accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the spot rate of exchange
on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days
of the date of receipt of the accrued stated interest, a U.S. Holder that has made the election described in the prior
sentence may translate such interest using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the stated interest.
The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. Holder and may not be changed
without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize
exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued stated interest income on the date such interest is received. The
amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the
Euro payment received (determined based on the spot rate on the date such stated interest is received) in respect
of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income that has accrued during such accrual
period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time.
Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax
credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

Stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered
“passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal
income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to
such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). There are significant
complex limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. U.S. Holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition
(less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as stated interest income
as discussed above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. Holder) and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be the cost of such Note to such U.S. Holder. The cost
of a Note purchased with Euro will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the Euro purchase price translated at the
spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market
and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special
election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by
translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase.

If a U.S. Holder receives Euro on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such Euro translated at the spot rate
on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities
market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar
value of such Euro by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. The
special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the purchase and disposition of Notes traded
on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder
and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If the Notes are not traded on an established securities
market (or the relevant holder does not make the special settlement date election) an accrual basis U.S. Holder
will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the
disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary
income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note
that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note
generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or
expense. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount

290


-----

of a Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s foreign
currency purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date principal is received from the Issuer
or the U.S. Holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s foreign currency purchase
price for the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon
the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may recognize
exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which
will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of stated interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize any exchange gain or
loss (including with respect to accrued interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S.
Holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note in excess of exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source gain or loss
and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals)
derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency
with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign
currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses
in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in
respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax return
disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS
Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

U.S. Holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in
excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an information
report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S. Holder does not file a required
IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the
assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close
before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. The Notes generally will
constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in
an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual
for purposes of these rules.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally should not be subject to
U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any payments on the Notes and gain from the sale, redemption or
other disposition of the Notes unless: (i) that payment and/or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by
that Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the U.S.; (ii) in the case of any gain realized on the sale or
exchange of a Note by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, that Holder is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in
the taxable year of the sale, exchange or retirement and certain other conditions are met; or (iii) the Non-U.S.
Holder is subject to tax pursuant to provisions of the Code applicable to certain expatriates.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on the Notes and to the
proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. Holder
unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient, and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption.
Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification
number or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to comply with the
applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. In general, payments of principal and interest in respect
of, and the proceeds from sales of, the Notes, payable to a Non-U.S. Holder by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S.
intermediary will not be subject to backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements if appropriate

291


-----

certification (IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or other appropriate form) is provided by the Non-U.S. Holder
to the payor and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the certificate is false.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may
be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to be entered
into in connection with the Notes, the Issuer has agreed to sell the Notes to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial
Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Notes from the Issuer.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase
all the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes
which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other
Initial Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After
the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the
Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their
affiliates.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the
Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the Offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement will provide that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited
exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued by the Issuer
or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes for a period of 60 days after the Issue Date.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have
agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” within
the meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with
Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by brokerdealers who are registered as such under the U.S. Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the commencement of this
Offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not it is participating in the
Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made
otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by
Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer, and will not effect any offers or sales of any notes
in the United States unless it is through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by the
regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section
21 of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received by it in connection with the
issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the
Issuer or the Guarantors; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by
it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as
defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs
Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has
been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been

293


-----

prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes.
This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

Each Initial Purchaser has, severally and not jointly, represented and agreed that it will not offer, sell or
otherwise make available any Notes to any “retail investor” in the European Economic Area or the United
Kingdom. The expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

- a retail client (with respect to the European Economic Area, as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”) and, with respect to the United Kingdom, as defined in
point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”));

- a customer, with respect to the European Economic Area, within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU, as
amended (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II and, with respect to the United
Kingdom, within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA; or

- not a “qualified” investor (with respect to the European Economic Area, as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129, as amended (the “Prospectus Regulation”) and with respect to the United Kingdom, as defined
in the EU Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA).

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such
Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels
for distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target
market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory
regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly
or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where
such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes
are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of
this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of,
directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition
would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of
Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application has been made to list
the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit to trading on the Euro MTF
Market in accordance with the rules and regulations of that exchange. We cannot assure you that the Notes will
be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by applicable
law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the
Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial
Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by
law. We cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or
that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk
_Factors—The interests of the principal shareholder may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes—An_
_active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the Notes.”_

294


-----

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the fourth business day (as such term is used for
purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement
cycle is being referred to as “T+4”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary
market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the
next two succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any
such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult
their own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These
transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales.
Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required
to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing Notes in the
open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may
be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect
investors who purchase in the Offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may
have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise
exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition,
neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Initial Purchasers will engage in
these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. See “Risk
_Factors—The interests of the principal shareholder may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes—An_
_active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the Notes.”_

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates or other parties involved in the Acquisition from time to time have
provided in the past, are currently providing, or may in the future provide, investment banking, financial
advisory, commercial banking, various lending, hedging, cash management, guarantee or other banking or
budgeting services to us and our affiliates under bilateral agreements or local facilities in the ordinary course of
business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or
their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective
affiliates may be lenders, managers and/or agents under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Initial Purchasers
have also committed to provide bridge financing in connection with the financing of the Multiversity Investment
in the event the Offering is not consummated. In connection with these financings, the Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates have received and will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such
capacities.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates,
including the Notes. If the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with the
Issuer, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the
Issuer’s securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make
investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such
securities and instruments.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of the Notes_
_offered hereby._

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or the securities laws of any
state of the United States or any other jurisdiction, and, therefore unless so registered, may not be offered or sold
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of such state or other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Issuer is
offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

(a) in the United States, to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as defined in
Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

(b) outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S (and only to
investors who, if resident in a Member State of the EEA or the UK, are not retail investors, defined as a
person who is one (or more) of:

i. a retail client, (with respect to the European Economic Area, as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”) and, with respect to the United Kingdom, as defined
in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”));

ii. a customer, with respect to the European Economic Area, within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU,
as amended (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II and, with respect to the United
Kingdom, within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under
the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client, as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA; or

iii. not a “qualified” investor (with respect to the European Economic Area, as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129, as amended (the “Prospectus Regulation”) and with respect to the United Kingdom, as
defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA).

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and
agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes are being offered for resale in a transaction not involving a
public offering in the United States within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act, that the Notes have not

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE**
**COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and_
_the security interests being provided for the Notes, and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in_
_Italy. The description below is only a summary, and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all the_
_limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes or any Notes Guarantees_
_or security interests being provided for the Notes. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own_
_legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Italy, which is a member state of the European Union (a “Member
**State”).**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the
European Union, other than Denmark, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company (subject to certain exceptions) is the court of the Member State (other than
Denmark) in which the relevant company’s centre of main interests (“COMI”) (as that term is used in
Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) is situated.

COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time, but is determined for the purposes of decided
which court has competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency
petition: moreover, the determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of
the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1), second sentence, of the
Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” Under Article 3(1) of
the Recast Insolvency Regulation there is, in most cases, a rebuttable presumption that a corporate debtor has its
centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary. The presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State
within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the
Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be
rebutted: for instance, where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of
its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner
that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the
management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take
into consideration when determining the centre of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings
are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location
where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established.

If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member
State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that Member State have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency
proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Recast Insolvency Regulation and accordingly a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the
Recast Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the Recast
Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although
secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member
State (other than Denmark).

If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is in a Member State
(other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member
State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial
insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (as defined in Article 2(10)
of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be
any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of
doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings
that are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean
“any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the
request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”
Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings in another
Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member
State in the three month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings.

300


-----

The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other
Member State are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where
main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of main interests have not yet been
commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than
Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced
in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under the conditions laid down by
that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor
whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of
the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under
the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request
the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency
proceedings usually become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain
exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed
jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary
insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency
practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may
exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than
Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to
certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced
in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request
to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets).

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency
Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a
group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may
be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by
an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group.
Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s
recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the
Issuer.

It remains to be seen what impact the recent vote by the United Kingdom to leave the EU will have on the
regulatory environment in the EU and the United Kingdom, and on the applicability of EU law in the United
Kingdom. In a “no-deal Brexit” scenario in particular, it may be harder for English office holders and English
restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and to effectively deal with assets
located in those other Member States. Much depends upon the private international rules in the particular
Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In
particular, in cases where the appointment of an

English office holder has been made in reliance on an English domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it
is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant Member State.

**Italy**

**Limitations on Granting Security Interests and Guarantees under Italian Law**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a
guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its
by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization
and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the
context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also
be triggered.

**_Corporate Benefit_**

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive
a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such

301


-----

company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and
determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors
and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant
company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of
the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for
downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial
obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and
effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure
financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an
entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for
the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may
derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an
up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may
include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other
members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely
untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such
transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed
by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or
indirect economic benefit to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a
security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a
conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the
subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor
if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within
the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate
benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising
control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control.
Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be
declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and
such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees
or security interests granted by Italian companies.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the
meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”),
whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with
the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null
and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph
3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for
the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial
activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of
the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the
above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group
of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

**_Financial Assistance_**

In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which
would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of
the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give
financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or
subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls
the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or
subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation
of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions
is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the
company.

In light of the above, no Italian company shall undertake to guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred,
in full or in part, to purchase its shares and which would therefore constitute the provision of financial assistance

302


-----

within the meaning of Article 2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code and/or any
other law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by Italian courts unless in compliance with the
limitations and exceptions set forth therein.

**_Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_**

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is issued to
guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum
amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by
reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture).

**_Limitations to the Notes Guarantees and Collateral_**

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on corporate benefit and financial assistance, the
maximum amount that any Guarantor and/or security provider incorporated under the laws of Italy (if any) (the
“Italian Guarantor”) may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the relevant Notes
Guarantee and/or security provider under the relevant security interest will be subject to limitations. By virtue of
these limitations, the obligations of a Guarantor and/or security provider incorporated under the laws of Italy
under its Notes Guarantee and/or security interest may be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Notes, or such Guarantor and/or security provider may have effectively no obligation under its Notes
Guarantee and/or security interest.

In particular, as regards any Italian Guarantor, given the above limitations in relation to Italian financial
assistance law and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) in order to comply with the provisions of the Italian law in relation to financial assistance (including article
2358 and/or article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code), the Notes Guarantee and security
interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not include and/or extend to any amounts of the
Notes the purpose or the actual use of which is to finance, directly or indirectly, the acquisition of the
relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) and/or the subscription of any
shares or quota in the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) (or to
refinance, directly or indirectly, any existing indebtedness incurred for such purposes) and/or the payment of
any fees, costs and expenses, stamp, registration or other taxes in connection therewith;

(ii) the Notes Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed at any
time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or other financial
support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions) advanced or
made available from time to time to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries
pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1 and 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or
indirectly) on or following the Acquisition Closing Date, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of
the relevant Notes Guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of
its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or received upon the enforcement of any security
interests granted by such Italian Guarantor; provided further that no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a
Guarantor and/or security provider in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that it is entitled to
set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any
payment made by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or as a result of the
enforcement of any security interests granted by it;

(iii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by any Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount
of the Notes;

(iv) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor
will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal
to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the relevant Italian Guarantor at that
time;

(v) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of Civil
Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of such Guarantor under its Notes
Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the

303


-----

Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set
forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Banking Act, respectively.

In the event that the Post-Closing Reorganisation does not occur by December 15, 2022, as regards to Target and
any of its subsidiaries, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial assistance law and corporate benefit,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
the Intercreditor Agreement, until such time as the Post-Closing Reorganisation is completed (if ever):

(i) the Notes Guarantee and security interests to be granted by Target and any of its subsidiaries will only
guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes in a proportion equal to that which Tranche B
bears to the nominal principal amount of the Notes at issuance (the “Refinancing Proportion”) and shall not
exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or other
financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions)
advanced or made available from time to time to Target and any of its subsidiaries (or any of its direct or
indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1 and 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer
(whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Acquisition Closing Date, and outstanding at the time of the
enforcement of the relevant Notes Guarantee or security, net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the
enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or received upon the enforcement of any
security interests granted by Target and any of its subsidiaries; provided further that Target and any of its
subsidiaries shall not be liable as a Guarantor and/or security provider in respect of any amounts in excess of
the amount that it is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione)
arising as a result of any payment made by Target and any of its subsidiaries under the relevant Notes
Guarantee and/or as a result of the enforcement of any security interests granted by it;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Target and any of its subsidiaries, also in accordance with
article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of
the Tranche B (as described under “Summary—The Offering”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by
an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied
by the ratio of (I) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as described under
“Summary—The Offering”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes;

(iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by Target and any of its
subsidiaries will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the
Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by Target and any of its
subsidiaries at that time;

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian
Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of Target and any of its subsidiaries
under its Notes Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious
pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the
provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Banking Act,
respectively; and

(v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee and/
or security interest by Target and any of its subsidiaries does not (and will not) include and does not (and will
not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations under Tranche A (as described
under “Summary—The Offering”) under the Notes or in any way exceeding the Refinancing Proportion;

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the proceeds of the
Notes which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of Target and Multiversity and, therefore, does not
fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of
the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not
sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion
of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription directly or indirectly by the Issuer
of the share capital of Target and Multiversity. Should the Notes Guarantee and/or security interests granted by
Target and any of its subsidiaries be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions
regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such
Notes Guarantee and security interests could be declared null and void.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as
Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of
the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding

304


-----

amounts due by such Italian Guarantor to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with
respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security
documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to
the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as
guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents
related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction
documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such
guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the
limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by an
Italian Guarantor to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum
amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in
the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such
determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed
disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests shall be distributed among the
guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover
limited amounts under the relevant Notes Guarantees and security. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Security Agent_**

The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as representative
(rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code.
Under such provision (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees
assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative
(rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the
holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security
interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and
enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph
3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly
parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate
documents or public registries.

In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the
appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that
therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured
by the security under the security documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and
enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and
the subject matter of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are untested by Italian courts and,
therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian court, it cannot be excluded that
an Italian court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in
favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral
and/or cannot enforce that Collateral.

Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante
_comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly_
appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of
such appointment may not be upheld by a court.

Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be
created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties
to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates
and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept
of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and
powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

**_Certain additional Considerations in Relation to Granting Security Interests and Guarantees_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect
creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in
case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises
management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management
and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy
as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior
only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the
borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the
borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior
to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to
shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be
interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either
directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of
such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as
_società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may
apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the
relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian
subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should
any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the
obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able
to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have
a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes
is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created
over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian
subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

**_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a
liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in
comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of
the Italian law are, first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction
of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security
interests given by it or by way of a trust could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy
receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy
Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor
during the suspect period. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of
clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations—Bankruptcy
_proceedings (fallimento)” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become_
unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of
any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or
guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there
are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have
a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, guarantees, security interest and rights in
general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

- the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors;

306


-----

- an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the judge;

- with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party
can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own
obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil
Code;

- claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law
concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or
become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

- pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible
assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its
opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on
reasonable grounds;

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited
by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the
fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles
and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian
law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or
instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to
all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment
might not be held to do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto);

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be
subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the
provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not
binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other
provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the
parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or
instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the
purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code
are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations
of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined
by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under
the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue
individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic
stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee
is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the
date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls at the date of the notification of
the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only
to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant
foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the
relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa);
the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an

307


-----

indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is
witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance
waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian
law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory
provisions;

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company,
which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, inter alia, any obligation
to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law
no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related
implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of
interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according
to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt
were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an
agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act) may not be
enforceable;

- if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties
to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a
consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation;

- a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing
enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and

- in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge
could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a
consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would
be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/
shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be
brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a
guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a
declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act
that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said
guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to
make the two following findings:

- that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or,
if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for
the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

- that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act
was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent
design.

**Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions with
which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court
procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be
more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be
familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special
provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities
nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned companies are
involved.

308


-----

Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are
expected in the near future. In particular, the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 (the “Insolvency
**Code”), which implemented the Italian Law No. 155 of October 19, 2017 and substantially reformed the Royal**
Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942, as subsequently amended and supplemented and currently in force (the
“Italian Bankruptcy Law”), was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale No. 38 of February 14, 2019. The main
innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to
its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation
(liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework
in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for
by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use
of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern
proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized
courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code
aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform.

Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on
March 16, 2019, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been
postponed to September 1, 2021 by the Law Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020 (as converted by Law No. 40 of
June 5, 2020) and is now scheduled for May 16, 2022, except for the section named Parte Prima-Titolo II (i.e.,
the new preventive alert and mediation phase), which will entry into force on December 31, 2023, pursuant to
Article 1 of the Law Decree No. 118 dated August 24, 2021 (the “Law Decree 118/2021”), published in the
Gazzetta Ufficiale No. 202 of August 24, 2021.

Law Decree 118/2021 needs to be converted in law within 60 days from its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale,
otherwise it will cease to be effective; in the context of the conversion process changes and amendments—which
cannot be foreseen—may be included and impact the above new provisions. The main innovations of the Law
Decree 118/2021 are the following:

(i). additional postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code;

(ii). introduction of a new a negotiated composition proceeding (composizione negoziata della crisi) and of a
simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato
_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio);_

(iii). amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which anticipate certain provisions of the Insolvency Code.

The postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code, and the amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, are effective as of August 25, 2021 (i.e., the day following the publication of the Law Decree 118/2021 in
the Gazzetta Ufficiale), while the composizione negoziata della crisi and the concordato semplificato per la
_liquidazione del patrimonio are effective as of November 15, 2021. Accordingly, the practical consequences of_
the implementation of such reforms cannot to date be foreseen in their entirety.

The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two
following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree
118/2021 requesting the court to confirm or modify the protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if
necessary, to enact the interim measures necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures”), and
**_(ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 asking the court to_**
authorize certain acts, or to modify the conditions of certain contracts if, as a consequence of the COVID
pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur.

The composizione negoziata della crisi is started by the entrepreneur, on a voluntary basis, with the filing of a
petition for the appointment of an independent expert (the “Expert”), through a digital platform (the
“Platform”).

Together with the petition, the entrepreneur must file the documents listed under Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the
Law Decree 118/2021, collectively aimed at giving a clear representation of the entrepreneur’s financial status
and indebtedness.

The Expert is appointed by a three-member commission instituted by the Chamber of Commerce of the main
town of each Italian Region, formed by a judge, a member appointed by the Chamber of Commerce’s president
and a member appointed by the prefect.

The Expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and/or qualifications, undertake a specific
training, and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and certain additional
requirements aimed at ensuring its independence towards the entrepreneur.

309


-----

The composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore
_commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo) which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_
assets, their business and/or their finance such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow,
notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy Law are not met.

Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply to
corporate groups.

The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the
filing of a petition for the appointment of an independent expert (the “Expert”), through a digital platform (the
“Platform”).

Together with the petition, the enterprises must file the documents listed under Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Law
Decree 118/2021, collectively aimed at giving a clear representation of the their financial status and
indebtedness.

The Expert is appointed by a three-member commission instituted by the Chamber of Commerce of the main city
constituting the “capoluogo” of the relevant Italian Region, formed by a judge, a member appointed by the
Chamber of Commerce’s president and a member appointed by the prefect.

The Expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and/or qualifications, and meet the requirements
set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and certain additional requirements aimed at ensuring its
independence towards the entrepreneur.

The Expert assesses his/her independence, the adequacy of his/her professional expertise and his/her time
availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is positive, notifies
his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative outcome, the Expert
confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert.

If the Expert accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are
concrete chances of recovery (risanamento). The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally, and can be assisted
by its counsels.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties
involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings
close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with
fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried
out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. The
entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation, and manage his/her assets
without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of
credit assignment, and/or transfer their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in
an informed manner, and the access to the composizione negoziata della crisi does not, by itself, constitute
ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply to negotiations involving employment
contracts.

If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the
entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she notifies the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the Chamber of
Commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition.

The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not
agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed
situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations
require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the assignment is required by the fact that the
entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert
issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the
court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any).

Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or
with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of the Protective Measures. The relevant
petition is published in the companies’ register together with the Expert’s acceptance. The Protective Measures
consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain
preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) (unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur) and all enforcement and interim
actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting
creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims.

310


-----

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures, until the date
of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur
cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their
obligations under the contracts pending with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their
expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the
missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the
Protective Measures.

On the same date of the filing of the petition with the companies’ register requesting the application of the
Protective Measures, the entrepreneur requests the court to confirm or amend of the Protective Measures, and, if
necessary, to enact the Interim Measures.

If the entrepreneur fails to file such petition to the court, the Protective Measures are ineffective. Additionally, if
the entrepreneur fails to request the publication of the case number (numero di ruolo generale) assigned by the
court within 30 days from the publication of the petition with the companies’ register, the petition requesting the
application of the Protective Measures is canceled from the companies’ register.

Within 10 days from the filing of the petition requesting to confirm or amend the Protective Measures, and, if
necessary, to enact the Interim Measures, the courts schedules a hearing, and upon failure of scheduling such
hearing, the Protective Measures become ineffective.

At the hearing, the court hears the parties, the Expert and the creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective
Measures and the Interim Measures. The court can appoint a court expert and carry out all the relevant
investigation measures.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by a court order
in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the
Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of
240 days.

Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective
Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the
purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations, or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice
caused to the creditors that file the relevant request.

Pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary and activity, and, upon
written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent
with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives
of recovery, he reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding
the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the
Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. When Protective Measures
and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such measures
or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent
that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the
creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

 - the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same corporate group to incur new super-senior
(prededucibile) indebtedness pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

 - the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior (prededucibile) indebtedness pursuant to Article 111 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law via shareholders’ financing;

 - the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under
Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code.

The Expert may invite the parties to renegotiate in good faith the conditions of certain contracts (other than
employment contracts) if, as a consequence of the COVID pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on
the entrepreneur. If the parties do not agree, the entrepreneur can file a petition asking the court to amend the
conditions of such contracts. The court hears the Expert and takes into account the interests of the relevant
contractual counterparty, and, if it decides to grant the amendments, ensures the balance between the mutual
obligations, if necessary providing for the payment of an indemnity.

Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as
follow:

 - execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for
application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021 if, according to
the Expert’s Final Report, such contract ensures the continuation of the business for at least 2 years;

 - execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 octies of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law;

 - execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects
provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law without the need for the
independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided thereby.

At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt
restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182 bis,
Article 182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Alternatively, the entrepreneur may:

 - arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67,
Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

 - file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio pursuant to
Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021;

 - enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the so-called
Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure.

Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021:

 - the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their effects in
the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione
_dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato_
_preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta_
_amministrativa),_ extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione
_straordinaria) or concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio;_

 - the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of
security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions
pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the
development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery in place at the time the
payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made;

 - acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its
appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or if the court has denied its
authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021;

 - payment and transactions, made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be
consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery of the enterprise,
or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of
exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions.

Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition
with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio).

If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome, and that the options
provided under Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days
following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file a petition for admission to the concordato
_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under_
Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The petition for concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’
register by the registry of the court within the day following the filing. From the date of such publication, the
effects provided under Articles 111, 167, 168 and 169 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply.

The court verifies the formal correctness of the proposal, acquires the Expert’s Final Report and an opinion of the
Expert on the possible outcome of the liquidation and the relevant guarantees offered thereunder, and (i) appoints

312


-----

a court expert, (ii) gives order to the entrepreneur to notify the proposal, together with the Expert’s Final Report,
to the creditors resulting from the list that was attached to the petition for the appointment of the Expert pursuant
to Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Law Decree 118/2021, and (iii) schedules the hearing for the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio.

The court issues a decree sanctioning the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio when it
finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations and the
adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with the statutory priority
and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to
what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each
creditor receives a certain recovery.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having been
notified of the same.

Apart from the Law Decree 118/2021 and the Insolvency Code, the most recent reforms that have been
implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the
reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to
Italian Bankruptcy Law (the “Decree”). The Decree entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in
the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, entered into
force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and (ii) the amendments
implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by
Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill
of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis”
procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by
the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses
being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue
procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses
and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency
(insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more
creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no
longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent rather than a temporary
status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial
distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard
the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent
insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

In addition to the composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio described above, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are available under Italian_
law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies.

The amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, which anticipate
certain provisions of the Insolvency Code, will be examined in the following sections.

**_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor
and because informal arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to
being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable
transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a
company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement
with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

**_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of_**
**_the Italian Bankruptcy Law_**

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento) prepared by
companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An
independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the

313


-----

truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint
the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the
requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of
misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore,
no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring
agreements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike court-supervised pre-bankruptcy
composition with creditors’ proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do
not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party
creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt,
the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization
plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential
application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’
Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and
would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than
in case of a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors proceeding or a debt restructuring
agreement.

**_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_**
**_(accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_**

The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt restructuring
agreements, subject to court’s sanctioning (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must
assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the
agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-adhering creditors can be fully satisfied within the following
terms: (a) 120 days from the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of
debts which are due and payable to the non-adhering creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of
the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall
due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-adhering creditors as at the date of the
sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in
a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can
initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement
entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting
from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative
or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain
any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to preexisting debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not
expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can
therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the
sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or
postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the
partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned
publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the
companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the
completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the
publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the
creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place
and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security
interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days)
within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited.

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an
application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the
moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication
of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate
the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Italian Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the
outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._

The new Article 182 bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of
May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial
amendments are made to the plan.

If substantial amendments are made to the plan prior to the court’s sanctioning (omologazione), (i) the
independent expert carries out a new assessment on the truthfulness of the business and accounting data, the
feasibility of the agreement and its attitude to allow payment of the non-adhering creditors within the terms
provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and (ii) the debtor requests the
creditors to confirm their adherence to the debt restructuring agreement. The independent expert carries out a
new assessment also in case of substantial amendments to the agreement.

If substantial amendments to the plan become necessary after to the court’s sanctioning (omologazione), the
debtor amends the plan in order to ensure the performance of the obligations provided under the debt
restructuring agreement, and requests the independent expert to carry out a new assessment. In this case, the new
plan and the new assessment of the independent expert are published in the companies’ register and notice of
such publication is given to the creditors by means of certified mail or certified email. Creditors may oppose the
new plan within 30 days from the notice of the publication

Pursuant to Article 182, Paragraph 4, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by the Law Decree 118/2021,
the court can sanction the debt restructuring agreement also if the Italian Tax Authority or the Italian Social
Security Authority do not adhere, provided that their adherence is essential in order to reach the percentage of
60% provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and that the claims of the
non-adhering Italian Tax Authority and Italian Social Security Authority are likely to be satisfied to a greater
extent as a result of the debt restructuring agreement than as what would be the case in bankruptcy. The
adherence of the Italian Tax Authority and of the Italian Social Security Authority must occur within 90 days
from the filing of the debt restructuring agreement proposal.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021,
the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is reduced to
the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under Article
182 bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) does not previously file a petition for
admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and
does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and
introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182-octies, Article 182-novies and Article 182-decies,
thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt
restructuring agreements by obtaining approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to
the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request
the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a so-called
“cram-down”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-adhering creditors are not treated
worse than under any effectively available alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a
non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business
activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly notified
of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring
agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa). If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of
non-adhering creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-adhering
crammed-down creditors can challenge the agreement and refuse to be forced into it.

The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final
Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is set
forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt
restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial
intermediaries and have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the
agreement to non-adhering creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid
even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect for the continuation of the business activity as a going
concern.

315


-----

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement
(convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class
would also bind non-adhering creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements
provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the truthfulness of the
business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and
_(iii) the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the_
recovery strategies undertaken by the debtor and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors
belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations and have been
kept informed). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days
after having been notified of the same.

The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the
standstill agreement provided under Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new
obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities
or the utilization of new facilities on non-adhering creditors.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021,
Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring
agreements. Non-adhering creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable
with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed
otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with
non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain
liable as guarantors.

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the
approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) enjoy
priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders,
but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for
a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors may be granted
such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is
expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the
agreement or the approval of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors.

Moreover, pursuant to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in
relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors described below) may authorize the
debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness
with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor,
having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the
new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing
debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the
expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best
satisfaction for all creditors. The aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the
additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring
agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo)
outlined below.

Furthermore, according to Article 182 quinquies, Paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the
sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182- bis, Paragraph 1 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called
_prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_
debtor, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it
is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an
imminent and irreparable prejudice to the debtor.

**_Court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to
insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal
to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its
business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such
composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds:
(i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three
preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of
the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor
company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a
restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the
truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato
_preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the_
date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim
measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain
security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date
on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against
such pre-existing creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment
of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment
of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of
the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or
affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and
debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the
composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors
belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the
partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition
for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the
latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective
receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within
a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition,
subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such
extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of
a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts
such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the
company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of
non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further
verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and
information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the
stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo
also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco).

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years
without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the
presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfil, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being
declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant
requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried
out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the
restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial
commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents.

317


-----

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with
creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the
court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness
authorized by the court aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business, pending the
_concordato in bianco, as well as the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to_
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application
pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to
Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, are treated as super-senior (so called
_prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security_
interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law.

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the business continues to be run by the debtor as a going
concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer
necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for
the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the
continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be
necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive
to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented.
Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up
of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to
supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’
meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its
corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge.
The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior judge’s authorization,
while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim
acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of
(a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan
provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The concordato preventivo is approved
only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not
exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of
the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right
will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the
Notes in the concordato proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with
respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to
vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in
meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are
not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or
the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided that they
receive, at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets, as assessed by an independent
expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court
may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected
to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting
creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the
implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different
classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless
sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a
greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for
individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the
aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy courtsupervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including,
in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims
(crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposal with

318


-----

liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case
of pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a pre-bankruptcy court-supervised
composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy
court-supervised composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and
having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors
are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims.

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on
the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and sanctioned (omologato), the court may grant
special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by
taking all corporate actions required.

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant
special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by
taking all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by
Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo),
pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the
debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may
request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of
the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by
the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be
authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti),
except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment
agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti
_preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di_
_locazione di immobili). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_
application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after
admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a
period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to
receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such
indemnification would be paid according to the concordato preventivo proposal.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public
prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt.

**_Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_**

A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial
liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor
when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no
longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by
the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises
(imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_
had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding
fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things:

- subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a
defined period;

- under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their
claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the
secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale
price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be

319


-----

considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors
may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore
_fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and_
sets forth the relevant timing in its decision;

- the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver
(curatore fallimentare);

- continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the
company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors;

- any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain
cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made
through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

- the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration is
suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of
the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by
Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a designated
judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one
of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as
a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation
of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real
estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the
liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain
preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian Tax Authority, and judicial and social security authorities.
Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is
unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual agreements
would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities
provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of
available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated.

- **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate**
prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be
filed by one or more creditors or third parties starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the
debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration
but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato
_passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to_
the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full
satisfaction, in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their claim affected by the proposal.
The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments
among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that
secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the
creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed,
by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required.

- **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be**
different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions.
Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated
according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the
insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims that benefit from
preferential treatment, which include creditors who hold a security interest (creditori ipotecari o pignoratizi)
and creditors who have a preference under law (creditori privilegiati in senso stretto); and (iii) for the
payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s
estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from
these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that
must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or
part thereof, or from a single asset.

320


-----

- **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or**
avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or of the
granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance
provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made
with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be
particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six
months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. Please note
that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may
last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or
transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request
of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

- **Acts ineffective by operation of law**

(1) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered
into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the
two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective
pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of
law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the
ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the
registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and

(2) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the
insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt
entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.

**•** **Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver / court commissioner.**

a. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed
back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and
be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive
knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

i. onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of
the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the
consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

ii. payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other
customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration;

iii. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency
declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time when the new
security was granted; and

iv. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency
declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time when the
new security was granted.

b. The following acts and transactions, if made during the period specified below, may be clawed back
(revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew
that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction:

i. payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into
or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and

ii. granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency
declaration.

c. The following transactions are exempted from claw-back actions:

i. payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market
practice;

ii. a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the
bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

321


-----

iii. the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil
Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is
intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of
kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the
purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually
exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out
therein;

iv. transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a piano
_attestato di risanamento under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_

v. a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of a concordato
_preventivo pursuant to Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an accordo di ristrutturazione_
_del debito pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_

vi. remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work
carried out by them; and

vii. payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to
services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

Additionally, pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the payments of debts that are immediately due
and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its
appointment in the context of a composizione negoziata della crisi, are exempted from claw-back actions
pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the development and
the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery in place at the time the payment/transaction/
granting of security interest was made.

In certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared
ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian
Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the
bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to
such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered
into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by
the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction
entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the
transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in
the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code provided for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with
respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from
the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can start enforcement proceedings over the relevant
assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent)
transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous
transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In
case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party
purchaser.

**_Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi_**
**_imprese in stato di insolvenza)_**

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial
enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, a company must
be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in
the year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as
shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last
financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public
prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’
claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those
credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary
administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase.

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is
insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario

322


-----

_giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization._
The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within 10 days from such filing, the
Ministry of the Economic Development (the “Ministry”) may release an opinion on the admission of the
company to the extraordinary administration proceeding. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing
of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy.

If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the
extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide
either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the
“Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years
(unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors
(concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary
commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the
financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends
upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the
company will be declared bankrupt.

If the Disposal Plan is approved, the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate claw-back actions according to
the avoidance provisions set forth with respect to bankruptcy proceedings. If acts such as those that could be
declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver (see above) are put in place among companies
belonging to the same group, the claw-back period is extended to up to three or five years.

**_Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di_**
**_insolvenza)_**

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law
No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is
complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The
Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company
must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the judicial phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least
500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those
from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry
following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry
assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will
manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a
Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be
completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery
Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings.

Unlike in the Prodi-bis procedure, in the Marzano procedure the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate
claw-back actions also if a Recovery Plan is approved, provided that this results in a material benefit for the
creditors.

**_Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_**

A compulsory administrative winding up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for certain
companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies,
credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be made subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative
winding-up is a special sort of insolvency proceeding in which the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy
court, but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The
procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly
provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the
management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The
effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is
appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di
_sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency_
proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect on creditors of
the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for

323


-----

example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to
existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings.

**_Interim financing_**

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain
authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines
(linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy
Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the_
expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, among others, the
relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access such
finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of
the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the
principal creditors.

Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status
(prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato
_preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an_
expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is
provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status.

**_Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_**

In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six
months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain
transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five
years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency
proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any
future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or
by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian
Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the
debtor made during the suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a
suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the
asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the
debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to
pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations,
unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the
transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with
respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge
of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable
obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured
obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy
receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The transactions potentially subject to
avoidance also include those contemplated by a Notes Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the
security documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted
under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant security documents may become
unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of
any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be
able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions,
all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if
entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or
thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to
insolvency.

In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various
national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

_The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Italy. The documents relating to the Collateral will be governed by_
_the laws of Italy and any jurisdiction where the Collateral is located. The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes_
_Guarantees (if any) will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by the laws_
_of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United_
_States. Because substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its and their directors and executive officers, are_
_located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any such_
_other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any)_
_and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or_
_state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer will appoint_
_an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in_
_each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws,_
_it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as mentioned_
_above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of_
_U.S. federal securities laws. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions_
_(including Italy) upon those persons or the Issuer provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on the_
_Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965_
_is complied with._

_If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such judgment in_
_jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments_
_outside the United States is described below for the countries in which the Issuer is located, you should consult_
_with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or_
_elsewhere outside the United States._

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgments obtained
in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not
require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of
May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato), among others, the following
conditions are met:

- the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law principles of
jurisdiction;

- the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with U.S.
law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been violated;

- the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of
defendant party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with
U.S. law;

- the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;

- there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

- there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which
commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

- the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by a U.S.
court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a
proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to that end. The competent Court of
Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set
out above.

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the
U.S. federal securities law is debatable. If an original action is brought before an Italian court, the Italian court
may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are
regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought
(e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory provisions of
Italian law.

**Notes to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the**
**six-month period ended June 30, 2021**

**1. Introduction and other information**

This document represents the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Multiversity
S.r.l. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021
(hereinafter also the “Unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”), authorized for issuance
in accordance with a resolution of the directors held on September 30, 2021, which shows a consolidated profit
of Euro 47,487,434, net of minority interests amounting to € 3,485,974. The period ended June 30, 2021, as the
same period of last year, has been characterized by the COVID-19 outbreak, a globally widespread epidemic
currently underway. However, this outbreak did not affect negatively the result of the period and the
consolidation of corporate assets, due to the positive results achieved by the companies belonging to the
Multiversity Group.

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021 have
been prepared in accordance with the Italian accounting standard OIC 30, which provides guidance on the
structure and content of interim financial statements. The Group has prepared the consolidated financial
statements on the basis that it will continue to operate as a going concern. The Directors consider that there are
no uncertainties that may cast significant doubts over this assumption. They have formed a judgement that there
is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future, and not less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period.

All the amounts in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, and these explanatory
notes, are expressed in units of Euro.

As requested by OIC 30 the comparative figures for the six months ended June 30, 2020 have been prepared as
they were not prepared and approved before.

The entire document, in the parts of which it is composed, has been prepared to give a clear, fair and truthful
representation of the financial position of the Group, as well as the economic result for the first half of the fiscal
year 2021 and first half of the fiscal year 2020, providing, if necessary, additional information on the estimates
made for the definition of values

In accordance with the accounting standard OIC 30, the explanatory notes to the first half of 2021 only highlight
the impact of events and transactions considered significant for understanding the changes in the Group’s
financial position and operating performance during the first half of the current year. The Unaudited Interim
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the
annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual consolidated financial
statements as at December 31, 2020.

Regarding the contents of these explanatory notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, in accordance with art. 2427 of the Italian Civil Code, it is pointed out that the Group:

 - has not issued bonds or similar financial instruments;

 - did not carry out any financing transactions during the period involving the temporary transfer of assets;

 - has not entered into any asset lending transactions against the deposit of a sum of money as security;

 - has not entered into any off-balance sheet agreements, other than those mentioned in these notes, whose
knowledge is useful for assessing the Group’s financial position;

 - did not carry out any atypical or unusual transactions, those that are not part of the Group’s normal
operations or that could have a significant impact on the Group’s financial position or operating
performance;

 - has not issued dividend-bearing shares or bonds convertible into shares, nor securities or similar instruments
pursuant to art. 2427, paragraph 1, no. 18 of the Italian Civil Code;

 - has not any separate earmarked assets or any funding earmarked for a specific purpose pursuant to
art. 2447-bis of the Italian Civil Code. Art. 2447 bis of the Italian Civil Code et seq.

In the case of assets and liabilities that fall under different accounts of the balance sheet, the explanatory notes
indicate where they are entered, if it is necessary for an understanding of the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements.

**Notes to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the**
**six-month period ended June 30, 2021**

Among the Multiversity Group is necessary to point out the Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l., established by
Ministerial Decree of April 20, 2006 (GU No. 118 of 23-5-2006—Ordinary Suppl. No. 125), which represents
one of the Italian universities with the most modern and effective technological standards in e-learning, with
modern educational systems and methodologies to respond to the different needs of today’s society. The study
courses provide a high degree of independence and personalization of the educational path and they are free of
any constraint of physical presence, even if constantly tracked, following the student and at the same time
monitoring the continuous level of learning (also through frequent moments of evaluation and self-evaluation).

The Group’s Universities use innovative, native, telematic technologies and adopt a system architecture capable
of managing and making high quality online university courses accessible to the student. The educational support
specialists who work alongside the teachers (tutors, mentors and coaches) assist the learner throughout the entire
course of study, in order to achieve a perfect balance of learning based on the affirmation of one’s potential, off
highly technological and interactive tools, TV learning and social learning that involve the student in a truly
unique and effective educational experience. The academic titles issued at the end of the study courses have the
same legal value as the titles issued by traditional universities.

_Business outlook_

In relation to the current trend and future prospects, also based on the evolution of the number of enrolments in
progress at the universities of the Multiversity Group, as well as the interesting projects in progress, the Group
foresees a further increase in prospective revenue and investments.

Considering the development of the current training offer and the growing trend in enrolments at our
Universities, a further significant growth in ordinary revenues is expected for the second half of 2021 and,
consequently, this growth could inject further impulse to new investments in educational, training and research
projects.

New degree courses will be offered starting from the AA 2021/2022, which will further boost revenue growth,
specifically “Philosophy”, “Statistics and Big Data” and “Infrastructure engineering for a sustainable mobility”.

Monitoring of operational activities is continuing in the light of regulatory and health developments. Therefore,
the Multiversity Group universities will continue to apply smart working, in order to ensure full safety for
workers and at the same time the full continuation of activities. The model and structure adopted by these
universities have been resilient in the face of the current crisis, also thanks to the strong capability to react of the
entire operational structure.

The Multiversity Group is at the forefront, especially against the backdrop of significant fragility of the social
fabric and the risks associated with the pandemic, to guarantee its students the execution of courses and the
availability of taking online exams, the first online university to offer this option.

We believe increasingly more firmly in the social mission of our universities and in the importance of online
training as a tool for accelerating social progress in our country, also in the light of the new paradigms imposed
by the pandemic.

We will continue to monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic and social context and take any necessary steps
in order to better respond to the needs of the market and our students.

**Notes to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the**
**six-month period ended June 30, 2021**

**2. Basis of presentation and consolidation**

**2.1 Basis of presentation**

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as at June 30, 2021, were prepared on the
basis of the going concern assumption. The items in the financial statements were valued according to general
prudence and accruals criteria on a going-concern basis, taking into account the substance of the transaction or
contract. The substance of each transaction or action, i.e. each corporate event, was therefore identified,
regardless of its origin, and an assessment made of the relationships between the various agreements that form
part of complex transactions.

The profits indicated in the Consolidated Financial Statements are exclusively those made at the end of the
reporting periods. The revenue and expenses shown are those pertaining to the financial half-year, regardless of
the date of collection or payment. Risks and losses pertaining to the financial year were taken into account, even
if known after the end of the reporting period. The miscellaneous elements included in the individual items are
valued and recognized separately.

Pursuant to article 2423-ter, par. 5, of the Italian Civil Code, regarding the comparability of the unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements, it should be noted that the previous year’s end figure is also shown
for each item in the balance sheet while the corresponding period of the previous half-year for each item is
shown in the income statement and cash flow statement. If the items are not comparable, the previous years’
figures are adjusted accordingly and an explanation of the reason why they are not comparable and their
adjustment (or the reasons why it is not possible to adjust them) is given in these notes to the financial
statements.

Pursuant to article 2423-ter, para. 2 of the Italian Civil Code, items preceded by Arabic numerals may be broken
down further, without eliminating the overall item and corresponding amount; these may only be grouped if, due
to their amount, the grouping does not affect the true and fair view of the Company’s financial and economic
position and the profit or loss for the period, or if it makes the financial statements clearer. In the latter case, the
note contains all the items in the group separately.

In these notes to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the information on items of
the balance sheet and associated income statement items are presented in the order in which the relevant items
are shown in the balance sheet and the income statement pursuant to Article 2427, para. 2 of the Italian Civil
Code.

The accounting standards adopted in the preparation of these Unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements are the same as those used for the Group Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended
on December 31, 2020, therefore no change or adoption of new accounting standards is reported in the
preparation of this document.

For a detailed explanation of the accounting standards applied in the preparation of these explanatory notes and
the contents of the items in the financial statements, reference should be made to the Basis of preparation
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.

The preparation of these Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may require the
application of accounting methods that, in certain circumstances, are based on subjective assumptions and
valuations, based on historical experience, the reasonableness of which is verified from time to time on the basis
of the relevant circumstances. The application of these estimates and assumptions impacted the amounts reported
in the financial statements, as well as the information provided in these explanatory notes.

The results of the estimations may be different from those shown in the year-end financial statements, due to the
uncertainty that characterizes the assumptions and the conditions on which the estimates were based.

The valuations made are periodically reviewed and the effects of any changes are reflected in the income
statement if they concern that period. If the adjustment affects both current and future periods, the change is
posted in the period in which the revision is made and in the related future periods. Certain valuation processes,
in particular the determination of any impairment of assets, are generally only carried out in full at the time of
preparing the annual financial statements, when all necessary information is available, except of cases where
there are indicators that require an immediate assessment.

**Notes to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the**
**six-month period ended June 30, 2021**

Finally, income taxes are recognized based on the best estimate of the weighted average rate expected for the
entire fiscal year.

There were no exceptional circumstances, incompatible with the general clause of clear, true and fair
representation, pursuant to art. 2423, paragraph 5 of the Italian Civil Code that made it necessary to depart from
legal provisions regarding preparation of the Unaudited Interim Condensed consolidated financial statements.

In compliance with accounting standard OIC 29, no correction has been made in the Unaudited Interim
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for material errors committed in previous years.

**2.2 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Judgements**

The preparation of the Group’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements requires
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to
the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

_Share base payments and year-end bonuses_

The Multiversity S.r.l. shareholders meeting held on June 25, 2021, approved a non-proportional share capital
increase by nominal € 1,000 in favour of some key managers of the Group, who have been assigned the option
rights to subscribe the capital increase once some relevant conditions are met. Taken into consideration that the
key conditions are not met at the date of the preparation of the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the share capital was not subscribed. In accordance
with Italian GAAP, the Group did not account for any estimate on the fair value of this share based payment
transaction.

The key managers of the Group, as approved by the Board of Directors meeting held in February 2021, are
recognized with a bonus if some key parameters, in terms of Group economic performance and individual once
are met, based on financial figures as at December 31, 2021. The estimation of year-end bonuses has been
accrued in the interim financial statements ended June 30, 2021.

**2.3 Consolidation Perimeter**

The Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of
Multiversity S.r.l. and the Unaudited Interim financial statements of the Italian and foreign subsidiaries, pursuant
to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code.

For this purpose, subsidiaries are the following:

 - entities in which another company holds the majority of votes that can be exercised at the ordinary
shareholders’ meeting;

 - entities in which another company has enough votes to exercise a dominant influence at the ordinary
shareholders’ meeting;

In any case, the following are considered subsidiaries:

 - companies over which another has the right, by virtue of a contract or a clause in the articles of association,
to exercise a dominant influence, when the applicable law permits such contracts or clauses;

 - companies in which another, based on agreements with other shareholders, alone controls the majority of
voting rights.

Subsidiary companies in which the Parent Company has joint control are also consolidated using the proportional
method. Investments in associated companies have been valued by the equity method (so-called synthetic
consolidation).

F-12

**Notes to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the**
**six-month period ended June 30, 2021**

Subsidiary companies are excluded from consolidation when their inclusion would be immaterial for the
purposes of presenting clearly and fairly the financial position and results of operations of the Group (article 28,
paragraph 2, letter a of Legislative Decree 127/1991).

There were no changes during the period in the consolidation perimeter. The table below shows the companies
included in the consolidation perimeter as at June 30, 2021, together with the stake percentage held and the
consolidation method applied.

**2.4 Consolidation and accounting standards applied**

The Unaudited interim Financial Statements of consolidated companies have been reclassified and adjusted in
order to align them to the Italian GAAP accounting standards adopted by the Group. In particular, the financial
statements of foreign companies have been appropriately reclassified in order to bring their balance sheet,
income statement and cash flows, as well as the form of presentation, into line with that required for preparation
of the consolidated financial statements.

The consolidation standards adopted for the preparation of these Unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements are the same used for the preparation of the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements as at
December 31, 2020.

The accounting standards adopted in the preparation of these six-months unaudited interim financial statements
are consistent with those used in the preparation of the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2020. In particular, a detailed explanation of the accounting standards applied in the
preparation of these explanatory notes and the contents of the items in the financial statements is provided in the
Explanatory Notes to the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

However, in compliance with the provisions of accounting standard OIC 30, which provides guidance on the
structure and content of the interim consolidated financial statements, some specific valuation criteria that differ
from those applied in the last annual consolidated financial statements are represented below.

**Notes to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the**
**six-month period ended June 30, 2021**

_Research and Development costs and Other Multi-Year Charges with future utility_

Research and development costs, as well as other multi-year charges with future utility, have been capitalized at
the end of the interim period only if there is a reasonable certainty that all the necessary requirements for their
inclusion among intangible assets have been met and properly defined.

Otherwise, these costs have been charged to the Income Statement for the interim period, although provision has
been made for the capitalization of the above-mentioned costs at the end of the fiscal year if the above-mentioned
requirements are met.

_Depreciation of intangibles and fixed assets_

Depreciation of intangibles and fixed assets was carried out only in relation to assets that are available and ready
for use during the six-month period under review, using the annual rate suitably reduced in proportion to the
duration of the six-month period. No depreciation was calculated based on acquisitions and disposals planned
during the period.

_Write-down of assets recorded in the Balance Sheet_

Write-downs of assets recorded in the Balance Sheet were only carried out if, at the end of the six-month period
under review, there is reasonable certainty that all the necessary requirements for carrying out the write-down
have been met. Otherwise, these assets will be written down at the end of the fiscal year if the above
requirements are met.

_Taxes for the period_

The tax burden was commensurate with gross income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, by using the
effective annual tax rate, i.e., the rate expected at the end of the fiscal year.

In accordance with article 2426, paragraph 1, no. 8-bis of the Italian Civil Code, monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency used to present the financial statements (the
so-called “reporting currency”) are recorded at the spot exchange rate at the end of the period, following initial
recognition.

Any resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are recorded in the Income Statement under item C17-bis)
“foreign exchange gains and losses” and any net gain, which is included in the profit for the period, is allocated
to a specific reserve that cannot be distributed until it is realized.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the accounting currency are recorded at
the exchange rate in force at the time of purchase. Should the exchange rate at the end of the period differ
significantly from that at the date of acquisition, the change in exchange rate is one of the elements taken into
consideration in the valuation process to determine the value that can be posted to the financial statements for
individual non-monetary assets. In this case, therefore, any exchange rate differences (positive or negative) are
included in the determination of the recoverable value.

**six-month period ended June 30, 2021**

consensual termination of the agreements in place effective from January 1, 2020, based on the payment of a

payables.

prepaid taxes are determined on the basis of the temporary differences between the values of assets and liabilities
and the corresponding values for tax purposes. In particular, prepaid taxes are recorded only if there is a
reasonable certainty of their future recovery. Deferred taxes, on the other hand, are not recognised if there is a
low probability that the related payable will arise.

Current taxes amount to € 23,437,645 related entirely to IRES and IRAP. The use of deferred taxes amounts to
€ 9,010,800 as already described previously in the paragraph relating to the Provisions for Risks and Charges. In
addition € 929,632 were recorded in relation to the payment of substitute tax on the greater value attributed to
revaluated goods according to art. 110, paragraph 4, of Legislative Decree no. 104 of August 14, 2020” as
already described previously in the paragraph relating to the Provisions for Risks and Charges.

**Independent Auditor’ Report**

**Independent auditor’s report pursuant to article 14 of Legislative Decree n. 39, dated 27 January 2010**
**(Translation from the original Italian text)**

To the Shareholders of
Multiversity S.r.l.

**Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**_Opinion_**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Multiversity Group, which comprise the balance sheet
as at December 31, 2020, the income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended,
and explanatory notes.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the
Group as at December 31, 2020, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with the Italian regulations governing financial statements.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated
_Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Multiversity S.r.l. in accordance with the_
regulations and standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian
Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements**

The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance with the Italian regulations governing financial statements, and, within the terms provided by
the law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, when
preparing the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, and for
appropriate disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern
basis unless they either intend to liquidate the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. or to cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.

The audit committee (“Collegio Sindacale”) is responsible, within the terms provided by the law, for overseeing
the Group’s financial reporting process.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have exercised
professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:

 - we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and

F-26


-----

**Independent Auditor’ Report**

obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

 - we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

 - we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors;

 - we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this matter in
forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going
concern;

 - we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 - we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible
for our audit opinion.

We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by
ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

**Report on compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements**

**_Opinion pursuant to article 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legislative Decree n. 39 dated January 27,_**
**_2010_**

The Directors of Multiversity S.r.l. are responsible for the preparation of the Report on Operations[1] of
Multiversity Group as at December 31, 2020, including its consistency with the related consolidated financial
statements and its compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.

We have performed the procedures required under audit standard SA Italia n. 720B, in order to express an
opinion on the consistency of the Report on Operations, with the consolidated financial statements of
Multiversity Group as at December 31, 2020 and on its compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, and
in order to assess whether it contains material misstatements.

In our opinion, the Report on Operations is consistent with the consolidated financial statements of Multiversity
Group as at December 31, 2020 and comply with the applicable laws and regulations.

With reference to the statement required by art. 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legislative Decree n. 39,
dated January 27, 2010, based on our knowledge and understanding of the entity and its environment obtained
through our audit, we have no matters to report.

This document represents the consolidated financial statements drawn up by Multiversity S.r.l. (hereinafter the
‘Parent Company’) as at December 31, 2020, which presents a consolidated profit for the year equal to
€ 28,373,647, net of the portion of profits attributable to minority interests equal to € 1,363,953. This document
sets out the economic and financial data of a fiscal year characterised by the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic, an epidemic which has spread throughout the globe, and is still in progress. However, this did not
have any adverse effects on the profit for the year and on the consolidation of corporate assets, due to the positive
results achieved by the companies owned by the Multiversity Group. The provisions of art. 106 of Legislative
Decree no. 18/2020 on holding via video-conference as well as electronic voting apply to the shareholders’
meetings, in order to guarantee remote participation in the context of the epidemiological emergency stemming
from COVID-19.

The Consolidated Financial Statements consist of the Balance Sheet (prepared in accordance with the format
provided by art. 2424 and 2424 bis of the Italian Civil Code), the Income Statement (prepared in accordance with
the format referred to in art. 2425 and 2425 bis of Italian Civil Code), the Cash Flow Statement (whose content,
in compliance with art. 2425-ter of the Italian Civil Code, is presented in accordance with the provisions of the
OIC 10 accounting standard) and by these Explanatory Notes, prepared in accordance with the provisions of
art. 2427 and 2427-bis of the Italian Civil Code.

These consolidated financial statements are drawn up in units of Euro.

The entire document, as regards the parts of which it is composed, has been drawn up in such a way as to give a
true and fair view of the financial position of the Multiversity Group, as well as of the economic profit for the
year, providing, where necessary, additional complementary information for this purpose.

In relation to the content of the explanatory notes pursuant to art. 2427 of the Italian Civil Code, the Group:

 - has not issued any bonds and/or similar financial instruments;

 - did not carry out any financing transactions with the temporary sale of assets during the 2020 fiscal year;

 - has not carried out any asset lending transactions against a security deposit of a sum of money;

 - has no off-balance sheet agreements in place other than those reported in both these Explanatory Notes and
in the Report on Operations, knowledge of which is useful for evaluating the equity and financial situation
of the company;

management of the company or capable of significantly affecting the Group’s economic and equity
situation;

 - has not issued any shares with regular dividend entitlement and bonds convertible into shares, or securities
or similar instruments pursuant to art. 2427, first paragraph, no. 18 of the Italian Civil Code

 - does not have any separate assets dedicated to specific business or any special-purpose loans pursuant to
art. 2447 bis et seq. of the Italian Civil Code.

In accordance with the provisions of art. 2423-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the following standards were adopted
in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements:

 - the individual items were measured on the basis of the principles of prudence and based on the going
concern assumption, as well as taking into account the economic function of the asset or liability element
considered;

 - only the profits actually realised during the year have been indicated;

 - the income and expenses for the year have been indicated, regardless of when they were collected;

 - the risks and losses pertaining to the year were taken into account, even if they became known after its
closure;

measured separately.

better understanding of the document.

explanatory notes also outline whether they belong to the items other than those in which they are recorded, if
this is necessary for the purposes of understanding the financial statements.

Where applicable, the principles and recommendations published by the professional bodies responsible for
accounting were also observed, in order to give a true and fair view of the equity, financial and economic

Where applicable, the principles and recommendations published by the professional bodies responsible for
accounting were also observed, in order to give a true and fair view of the Group’s equity, financial and
economic situation.

There have been no exceptional cases, incompatible with the general clause of true and fair view, pursuant to
art. 2423, paragraph 5 of the Italian Civil Code, which required an exception to the legal provisions for the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

In compliance with accounting standard OIC 29, no corrections have been made in the consolidated financial
statements for significant errors committed in previous years.

**2.2 Scope and principles of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of Multiversity S.r.l. and of
the Italian and foreign subsidiaries pursuant to art. 2359 of the Italian Civil Code, which are consolidated on a
line-by-line basis.

For this purpose, the following are considered subsidiaries:

 - companies in which another company holds most of the votes that can be exercised at the ordinary
shareholders’ meeting;

 - companies in which another company has enough votes to exercise a dominant influence in the ordinary
shareholders’ meeting;

In any case, the following are considered subsidiaries:

 - companies over which another has the right, by virtue of a contract or a statutory clause, to exercise a
dominant influence, when the applicable law allows such contracts or clauses;

 - companies in which another, on the basis of agreements with other shareholders, alone controls the majority
of the voting rights.

The equity investments in which the Parent Company holds joint control are also consolidated by applying the
proportional method. Equity investments in associated companies were measured by applying the equity method
_(so-called synthetic consolidation)._

Subsidiaries are excluded from line-by-line consolidation when their inclusion would be irrelevant for the
purposes of representing clearly and in a true and fair manner the equity and financial situation and the economic
result of the group (art. 28, paragraph 2, letter a of Legislative Decree 127/1991).

The financial statements used for the consolidation are those approved by the respective Shareholders’ Meetings
for the year ended December 31, 2020 or, if not yet approved, the draft financial statements of the Group
companies approved by the respective administrative bodies.

The financial statements of some companies included in the consolidation have been reclassified and adjusted to
bring them into line with the accounting principles adopted by the Group; in particular, those of the foreign
companies have been appropriately reclassified to make the balance sheet and financial data and the form of
presentation consistent with that required for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

The consolidation principles adopted for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

 - the financial statements of the subsidiaries included in the consolidation area have been consolidated using
the line-by-line method, which consists of the assumption of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses in
their total amount, regardless of the size of the shareholding held and the attribution to third-party
shareholders, in the items ‘Capital and reserves pertaining to minority interests’ and ‘Profit/(Loss) for the
year attributable to minority interests’, respectively, of the portion of shareholders’ equity and profit/loss for
the year pertaining to them.

 - the financial statements of the companies in which the Parent Company holds joint control are consolidated
by applying the proportional consolidation method, which provides for the proportional inclusion in the
consolidated financial statements of the assets, liabilities, costs, revenues and cash flows of the companies
over which it exercises joint control with shareholders not belonging to the group, considering only the part
of their value corresponding to the interest held directly or indirectly by the parent company.

 - The financial statements of associated companies are valued by applying the equity method, with which the
original cost of the investment changes in the periods following the acquisition of the investment to take
into account the pertinent shares of profits and losses and other changes in the shareholders’ equity of the
investee.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

 - The book value of equity investments consolidated using the line-by-line method was eliminated against the
corresponding portions of shareholders’ equity, less the result for the year, at the date of first inclusion in the
consolidation (taking into account what is specified in the next point). The difference between the
acquisition cost and the shareholders’ equity at fair value of the subsidiaries at the consolidation date is
allocated, where possible, to the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries net of deferred taxes, where
applicable; any remaining difference, if positive and if the requirements for recording goodwill provided for
by OIC 24 are met, is recognised in the item “Goodwill” within intangible assets. The residual difference
that cannot be allocated to assets and liabilities and to goodwill is charged to the income statement under the
“item B14 Other operating expenses”.

 - As regards the date relating to the first inclusion in the scope of consolidation, reference is made to
January 1st, 2020 where the acquisition of control took place in the first months of the year and the
economic effects are in any case not significant.

 - Goodwill is amortised on the basis of an economic utility estimated according to its useful life, taking into
account all the information available to determine the period in which the economic benefits will arise, in
exceptional cases in which it is not possible to reliably estimate their life, it is amortised over a period not
exceeding twenty years.

 - If an excess of shareholders’ equity is recognised over the acquisition cost, after having reduced, if
necessary, the values of the assets recorded to their recoverable value and of the liabilities recognised to a
value lower than their settlement value, net of prepaid taxes and having established the ‘Consolidation
provision for future risks and charges’ against estimated liabilities, this would be credited to the
consolidated shareholders’ equity under the item ‘Consolidation reserve’. The portion of shareholders’
equity attributable to minority interests of the consolidated subsidiaries is entered under the item ‘Capital
and reserves pertaining to minority interests’ of the shareholders’ equity, while the minority interests’ share
of the net result is shown separately in the consolidated income statement under the item “Profit/(loss) of
pertaining to minority interests”.

 - The credit and debit items between the companies included in the consolidation have been eliminated.

 - The income and charges relating to transactions between the companies included in the consolidation,
starting from the first consolidation, have been eliminated.

 - Significant profits and losses deriving from transactions between companies included in the consolidation
relating to values still included in the balance sheet at the end of the year have been eliminated.

 - Dividends distributed within the group were reversed from the consolidated income statement.

 - The conversion into Euro of financial statements expressed in foreign currencies (if applicable) is carried
out using the ‘current exchange rate’ method. The historical exchange rate at the date of first consolidation
is used for the items of the shareholders’ equity, the year-end exchange rate for the assets and liabilities of
the balance sheet and the average exchange rate for those of the income statement. Any foreign exchange
translation differences are charged directly to shareholders’ equity in the specific item ‘Translation reserve’.

 - The differences deriving from the elimination of intra-group payables, receivables, costs and revenues in
foreign currencies have been recorded under item ‘17-bis) Exchange gains and losses’.

**2.3 Valuation criteria applied**

This section presents, in detail, the criteria that contributed to the formation of the individual items of the
consolidated financial statements.

**Assets**

**Non current assets**

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recorded at purchase cost including any accessory costs, financial charges and direct and
indirect costs incurred before the use of the asset, for the portion reasonably attributable to them.

The cost of intangible assets, the use of which is limited over time, is systematically amortised in each fiscal year
according to their residual possibility of use. In particular, depreciation rates are applied that reflect the estimated
economically useful life of the assets.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

The amortization rates used are summarised in the following table:

**Category** **Rate**

It should be noted that the mobile applications, IT platforms and social networks owned by the Group came into
operation during the 2016 fiscal year.

The cost of these intangible assets also includes the costs incurred for filing copyrights in the public software
register.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recognised on the date on which the risks and benefits associated with the
acquired assets are transferred and are recognised, within the limit of the recoverable value, at purchase or
production cost net of the related accumulated depreciation, including all costs and directly attributable ancillary
charges, indirect costs relating to internal production, charges relating to the financing of internal manufacturing
incurred during the manufacturing period and up to the time when the asset can be used.

No legal revaluations have been carried out and the maximum limit of the measurements is the value in use,
determined objectively, of the asset itself.

Property, plant and equipment are systematically depreciated each year on the basis of economic-technical rates
determined in relation to the residual possibility of use of the assets, a criterion considered fully represented by
the following depreciation rates, which have remained unchanged with respect to the previous year:

**Category** **Rate**

**Write-downs for impairment of tangible and intangible assets**

At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indicator to suggest a fixed asset may have
suffered impairment. If these indicators were to exist, the Group would estimate the recoverable value of the
asset by making a write-down only if the latter were lower than the corresponding net book value. In the absence
of indicators of potential impairment, the recoverable value is not determined.

When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the Group estimates the
recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and its value in use determined
as the present value of estimated future cash flows.

An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value. When, subsequently, a loss on
assets, other than goodwill, ceases or is reduced, the book value of the asset or the cash-generating unit is
increased up to the new estimate of the recoverable value without exceeding the value that would have been
determined if no loss had been detected.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

**Financial assets**

**Equity investments**

Equity investments in unconsolidated ‘subsidiaries’ and ‘other equity investments’ are measured at purchase or
subscription cost, including accessory charges and adjusted to take into account any capital losses deemed to be
permanent.

The cost of the equity investments is not maintained, in compliance with the provisions of article 2426,
number 3), of the Italian Civil Code, if, at the end of the fiscal year, the equity investment is permanently lower
than the cost value. Impairment is determined by comparing the book value of the investment with its
recoverable value, based on the future benefits that are expected to flow into the investee’s economy. Impairment
is permanent when, justifiably, the causes of said impairment are not expected to be eliminated in a short period
of time, i.e. in a period so short as to make it possible to formulate reliable forecasts based on objective and
reasonably verifiable facts. If, on the other hand, the investee has prepared plans and programmes aimed at
restoring the conditions of economic-financial equilibrium, with characteristics as such to justify the belief that
the impairment of the investment is temporary, this can be defined as non-permanent.

Equity investments include investments in joint stock companies, consortium companies and consortia. Equity
investments recorded under fixed assets represent a long-lasting and strategic investment by the Group.

In the consolidated financial statements there are no long-term investments for a value higher than their fair
value.

**Receivables**

Receivables originating from revenues for the sale of goods or the provision of services are recognised under
current assets on the basis of the accrual principle when the conditions for the recognition of the related revenues
are met.

Receivables originating for different reasons are recognised if there is a ‘title’ to the receivable and therefore
when they actually represent a third-party obligation to the company; if of a financial nature they are classified
under financial fixed assets, with an indication of the portion due within the next fiscal year.

Receivables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, taking into account the time factor, and
within the limits of their presumed realisable value and, therefore, are shown in the balance sheet net of the
related bad debt provision deemed adequate to cover losses due to reasonably foreseeable non-collectability.

If the interest rate of the transaction is not significantly different from the market rate, the receivable is initially
recorded at a value equal to the nominal value net of all premiums, discounts, rebates and inclusive of any costs
directly attributable to the transaction, which generated the receivable. These transaction costs, any commission
income and expense and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are spread
over the duration of the loan using the effective interest criterion.

On the other hand, when the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is
significantly different from the market rate, the receivable (and the corresponding revenue in the case of
commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows plus any
transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate.

In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition
value of the receivable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as financial
income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate criterion.

In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the
present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial
income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the
transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest
income accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement
with the value of the receivable as a contra entry.

F-39


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

The value of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the amounts received, both by way of principal and
interest, as well as for any write-downs to bring the receivables back to their presumed realisable value or for
losses.

The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and the discounting back
are not relevant when the maturity of the receivables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the
contractual and substantial considerations in place on recognition of the receivable, and the transaction costs and
any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity is of an insignificant amount. In this
case, discounting was omitted, the interest was calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs were entered
among deferrals and amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the receivable to adjust the nominal
interest income.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents, revenue stamps and cash balances resulting from the accounts held by the Group with
credit institutions are allocated to this item, all expressed at their nominal value, specifically converted into
national currency when dealing with accounts in foreign currencies.

**Shareholders’ equity**

This item includes all transactions of a financial nature carried out between the Group and individuals who
exercise their rights and duties as shareholders. The share capital increase is recognised in the accounts only after
the transaction has been entered in the register of companies, as governed by art. 2444, paragraph 2, of the Italian
Civil Code. In this case, the corresponding amount is recognised in a specific item of shareholders’ equity (other
than the item ‘Capital’), which includes the amounts of capital subscribed by the shareholders, which will
subsequently be reclassified upon verification of the conditions described above.

**Provisions for risks and charges**

They are set aside to cover losses or debts of certain or probable existence, whose amount or date of occurrence
could not be determined at the end of the year.

In the measurement of these provisions, the general criteria of prudence and accrual accounting were respected,
and no provision was made for generic risks without economic justification.

Contingent liabilities are recognised in the financial statements and booked under provisions when they are likely
to materialise and when the amount of the related charge can be reasonably estimated.

Any risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible or for which no objective forecast of the
resulting charge is possible are indicated in the Explanatory Notes without allocating provisions for risks and
charges.

Risks whose probability of occurrence appears remote are not taken into account.

**Employee termination indemnity**

The provision for termination indemnities is set aside to cover the entire liability accrued towards employees, in
compliance with current legislation and collective labour and supplementary company agreements. This liability
is subject to revaluation pursuant to art. 2120 of the Italian Civil Code.

The termination indemnity recognised in the financial statements is given by the total of the individual
indemnities accrued by employees including revaluations, net of the advances paid.

**Payables**

Payables originating from acquisitions of assets are recognised in the balance sheet when significant risks,
charges and benefits associated with ownership have been substantially transferred. Payables relating to services
are recognised when the services have been rendered, that is, the service has been performed.

F-40


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

Financial payables originating from financing transactions and payables arising for reasons other than the
acquisition of goods and services are recognised when the company has an obligation towards the counterparty,
identified in compliance of legal and contractual regulations.

On the other hand, advances received from customers for supplies of goods or services not yet carried out are
included in the item advances.

Payables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, considering the time factor.

If the interest rate of the transaction is not significantly different from the market rate, the payable is initially
recognised at a value equal to the nominal value, net of all transaction costs and all premiums, discounts and
rebate deriving directly from the transaction that generated the payable. These transaction costs, such as ancillary
expenses for obtaining loans, any commission income and expenses and any difference between the initial value
and nominal value at maturity, are spread over the duration of the debt using the effective interest criterion.

When it appears that the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly
different from the market rate, the payable (and the corresponding cost in the case of commercial transactions) is
initially recognised at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows and taking into account any
transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate.

In the case of payables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value
of the payable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as a financial charge
over the duration of the payable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial payables, the
difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows,
determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income
statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract leads to the
attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest expense accruing on the transaction
is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with the value of the payable as a
contra entry.

The value of the payables is subsequently reduced by the amounts paid, both as principal and interest.

The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and the discounting back
are not relevant when the due date is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and
substantial considerations in place when the payable is recognised, and the transaction costs and any difference
between the initial value and nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting is
omitted and the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered among deferrals and
amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the payable to adjust the nominal interest expense.

**Payables to group companies**

Items D9, D10 and D11, where present, respectively include payables to subsidiaries (not consolidated),
associated companies and parent companies, as defined pursuant to art. 2359 of the Italian Civil Code. These
payables are indicated separately in the balance sheet.

Item D11 also includes payables to parent companies that control the Group indirectly, through their intermediate
subsidiaries.

Payables to companies subject to common control (so-called sister companies), other than subsidiaries,
associated companies or parent companies, are recognised in item D11-bis.

**Costs and revenue**

Costs and revenue are shown in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the relevant accrual
principle and are shown net of returns, discounts, rebates and premiums.

**Financial income and expenses**

They include all the positive and negative components of the economic result for the year connected with the
financial activity of the Group and are recognised on the basis of the accrual principle.

F-41


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

**Income taxes—Current, Prepaid and Deferred**

Current income taxes are allocated according to the accrual principle on the basis of the tax charges resulting
from the application of the tax legislation in force and are entered among tax payables net of advances.

Deferred and prepaid taxes are determined on the temporary differences between the value attributed to the assets
and liabilities according to statutory criteria and the value attributed to the same assets and liabilities for tax
purposes.

Deferred taxes are entered in the ‘Provision for deferred taxes’, recorded under liabilities among the provisions
for risks and charges, while the prepaid taxes are recorded in the receivables from others under current assets.

Assets deriving from prepaid taxes are not recognised, in compliance with the prudence principle, if there is no
reasonable certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be
reversed, of a taxable income higher than the amount of the differences that will be cancelled. Liabilities for
deferred taxes are recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will reverse in the foreseeable
future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year
in which the tax asset will be realised or the tax liability will be settled, based on the tax legislation established
by the provisions in force at the reporting date.

**Accruals and deferrals**

The portions of costs and income common to two or more fiscal years, according to the matching and accrual
principle, are recorded in these items. Based on this criterion, accruals or deferrals are recognised when the
following conditions are met:

 - the contract begins in one fiscal year and ends in a subsequent one;

 - the consideration for the services is contractually due in advance or in arrears with respect to services
common to two or more consecutive years;

 - the amount of accruals and deferrals varies with the passage of time.

Income and charges that have accrued in full in the fiscal year to which the financial statements refer or in
subsequent ones are not included among accruals and deferrals.

**Conversion criteria for foreign currency items**

In compliance with art. 2426, paragraph 1, no. 8-bis of the Italian Civil Code, monetary assets and liabilities in
currencies other than the functional currency in which the financial statements are presented (so-called
‘accounting currency’), after initial recognition, are recognised at the spot exchange rate on the closing date of
the fiscal year. The consequent gains or losses on foreign exchange are recognised in the income statement under
item C17-bis) ‘foreign exchange gains and losses’ and any net profit, which contributes to the formation of the
operating result, is set aside in a specific reserve that cannot be distributed until realised.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the accounting currency are recognised at the
exchange rate in effect at the time of their acquisition. If the exchange rate in force at the closing date of the
fiscal year is significantly different from that existing at the acquisition date, the exchange rate variation is one of
the elements taken into consideration in the valuation process to determine the value that can be booked in the
financial statements for the individual non-monetary assets. In this case, therefore, any exchange differences
(positive or negative) contribute to the determination of the recoverable value.

concerning the abolition of the ban on simultaneous enrolment at different universities, at different faculties or
schools of the same university and at different degree or diploma courses of the same faculty or school. This

established in a profoundly different historical and social context, affects a situation that sees our country in a

highly critical position in comparison with most of European countries, and also allows the possibility of creating
multidisciplinary paths and focusing on the enhancement and support of that training potential which, put to good
use, constitutes the driving force for the country’s longed-for social growth.

On February 2, 2021, Ministerial Decree 133 was issued (Amendment of the guidelines attached to Ministerial
Decree no. 386/2007—Flexibility of study courses) aimed at universities.

In order ‘to enhance the university autonomy in determining the educational systems of the study courses with
regard to similar or supplementary training activities and to allow greater flexibility in the determination of the
training courses’, it is established that: the university institutions, in the their autonomy, define the related or
supplementary activities, referred to in art. 10, paragraph 5, of the regulation adopted with decree no. 270 of
October 22, 2004, in the educational regulations of the course of study, in line with the objectives of the training
course. In the educational system, only the total credits assigned to these activities are indicated.

All training activities relating to scientific-disciplinary sectors not envisaged for basic and specialised activities
can be part of the similar or supplementary activities, as defined by the ministerial decrees determining the
degree classes and master’s degree classes, which ensure a multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary training of
the student.

The related and supplementary training activities can be organised in the form of teaching courses, laboratories,
exercises, seminars or other activities as long as they are aimed at acquiring knowledge and skills functionally
related to the cultural and professional profile identified by the course of study.

Ministerial Decree 289/2020 was published on March 25, 2021 concerning the GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR
THE PROGRAMMING OF UNIVERSITIES 2021-2023 and INDICATORS FOR THE PERIODIC
EVALUATION OF THE RESULTS for which the definition of new indicators is expected for the initial and

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

**Independent auditor’s report pursuant to article 14 of Legislative Decree n. 39, dated January 27, 2010**
**(Translation from the original Italian text)**

To the Shareholders of
Multiversity S.r.l.

**Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**_Opinion_**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Multiversity Group, which comprise the balance sheet
as at December 31, 2019, the income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year
beginning October 1, 2019 and for the year then ended, and explanatory notes.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the
Group as at December 31, 2019, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with the Italian regulations governing financial statements.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated
_Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Multiversity S.r.l. in accordance with the_
regulations and standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian
Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**_Other matters_**

Our audit was carried out in the context arisen as a result of the COVID 19 outbreak and related measures,
including restrictions of movement, issued by the Italian Government to protect the health of citizens.
Consequently, due to circumstances of force majeure, our audit procedures, defined by the professional
standards, have been carried out in the context of (i) a rescheduled personnel organization, based on a wide use of
working from home and (ii) of different ways of interfacing with the company employees and gathering
evidence, through the use, for the most part, of electronic documentation transmitted to us with techniques of
communication at distance.

**Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements**

The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance with the Italian regulations governing financial statements, and, within the terms provided by
the law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, when
preparing the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, and for
appropriate disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern
basis unless they either intend to liquidate the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. or to cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.

The audit committee (“Collegio Sindacale”) is responsible, within the terms provided by the law, for overseeing
the Group’s financial reporting process.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in

F-55

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have exercised
professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:

 - we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

 - we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

 - we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors;

 - we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this matter in
forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going
concern;

 - we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 - we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible
for our audit opinion.

We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by
ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

**1. Introduction and other information**

This document represents the first consolidated financial statements prepared by Multiversity S.r.l. (hereinafter
also the ‘Parent Company’ or ‘Company’), established on October 1, 2019, which closed with a consolidated
profit for the year of € 633,224 net of taxes of accrued in the year and shows the economic-financial data of a
three-month year of activity of solely the Parent Company. The reason for this simplification is described in more
detail in the section dedicated to the consolidation criteria.

For this reason, the layouts of the Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account do not show the corresponding
values of the previous financial statements.

These consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2019, consisting of the Balance Sheet, the Income
Statement, the Cash Flow Statement and the Explanatory Notes, have been drawn up in compliance with the
drafting principles and the formats referred to in articles 2423 et seq. of the Italian Civil Code and the legislation
set forth in Legislative Decree no. 127 of 9/4/1991, without applying any of the exceptions provided for by
art. 2423, paragraph 5, of the Italian Civil Code.

The aforementioned legislation has been interpreted and supplemented, where necessary, by the accounting
standards issued by the Italian Accounting Standards Setter (OIC), in their version revised in 2016.

These consolidated financial statements, drawn up in Euro units, consist of the Balance Sheet (prepared in
accordance with the format provided for by articles 2424 and 2424 bis of the Italian Civil Code), the Income
Statement (prepared in accordance with the format referred to in to articles 2425 and 2425 bis of the Italian Civil
Code), the Cash Flow Statement (the content of which, in compliance with article 2425-ter of the Italian Civil
Code, is presented in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standard OIC 10) and these Explanatory
Notes, drawn up in accordance with the provisions of art. 2427 and 2427-bis of the Italian Civil Code.

The entire document, as regards the parts of which it is composed, has been drawn up in such a way as to give a
true and fair view of the financial position of the Multiversity Group (‘Group’), as well as of the economic result
for the year, providing, where necessary, additional complementary information for this purpose.

In relation to the content of the explanatory notes pursuant to art. 2427 of the Italian Civil Code, the Group:

 - has not issued any bonds and/or similar financial instruments;

 - did not carry out any financing transactions with the temporary sale of assets during the 2019 fiscal year;

 - has not carried out any asset lending transactions against a security deposit of a sum of money;

 - has no off-balance sheet agreements in place other than those reported in both these Explanatory Notes and
in the Report on Operations, knowledge of which is useful for evaluating the equity and financial situation
of the company;

 - has not carried out any atypical or unusual transactions, or transactions that are unrelated to the normal
management of the company or capable of significantly affecting the Group’s economic and equity
situation;

 - has not issued any shares with regular dividend entitlement and bonds convertible into shares, or securities
or similar instruments pursuant to art. 2427, first paragraph, no. 18 of the Italian Civil Code;

 - does not have any separate assets dedicated to specific business or any special-purpose loans pursuant to
art. 2447 bis et seq. of the Italian Civil Code.

In accordance with the provisions of art. 2423-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the following principles were
observed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:

 - the individual items were measured on the basis of the principles of prudence and based on the going
concern assumption, as well as taking into account the economic function of the asset or liability element
considered;

 - only the profits actually realised during the year have been indicated;

 - the income and expenses for the year have been indicated, regardless of when they were collected;

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

 - the risks and losses pertaining to the year were considered, even if they became known after its closure;

 - the dissimilar elements included in the various items of the consolidated financial statements have been
assessed separately.

The Balance Sheet, the Income Statement and the Cash Flow Statement are drawn up in Euro units, rounding the
amounts up or down; also in the explanatory notes the amounts are expressed in Euro units as they guarantee a
better understanding of the document.

For the elements of the assets or liabilities that fall under more than one item of the financial statements, the
explanatory notes also outline whether they belong to the items other than those in which they are recorded, if
this is necessary for the purposes of understanding the financial statements.

Where applicable, the principles and recommendations published by the professional bodies responsible for
accounting were also observed, in order to give a true and fair view of the equity, financial and economic
situation.

The share capital of the Parent Company at the date of incorporation was equal to € 100,000, fully subscribed by
the company Multiversity S.p.A. The incorporation is effective from October 4, 2019.

In October 2019, a corporate restructuring operation was carried out for the entry of the new financial partner
into the share capital of the Parent Company, described below, whose objective is, in summarised form:

 - the transfer of the business unit, on October 25, 2019 by Multiversity S.p.A., in favour of Multiversity S.r.l.,
a newly formed company, including the investment held in Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. (direct
parent of Università Telematica S.r.l.). As a result of this extraordinary transaction, Multiversity S.r.l.
acquired indirect control, through Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A., of Università Telematica S.r.l., as
well as joint control of the investment in Certipass S.r.l.;

 - the entry into the capital of the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. of the new financial partner Paganini
Investments Sàrl.

It should be noted that, following the sale of the 50% stake in Multiversity S.r.l., Multivesity S.p.A. lost full
control due to joint control and this case makes the accounting envisaged by OPI 1 not applicable.

All the steps of the transaction summarised above are explained below.

On October 25, 2019, Multiversity S.p.A. transferred to Multiversity S.r.l., with effect from October 28, 2019,
the business unit that carries out university training support services.

As a result of the aforementioned contribution, the value of which is equal to € 650 million, all existing
relationships and all new activities relating to the aforementioned business unit are headed by the Parent
Company with the aim of rationalising all the experience gained in the field of university training and replicating
them in order to create the first ‘Global University’ with the same technology, philosophy, values and methods as
such to make students feel at home in every university in the various countries of the world and allow the
creation of multiple interdisciplinary and multicultural learning channels; a genuine ‘Business Model’ aimed at
university and postgraduate training.

Finally, on November 4, 2019 Multiversity S.p.A. sold 50% of Multiversity S.r.l. to the company Paganini
Investments S.a.r.l.

During the 2019 fiscal year, the transformation process of the subsidiary Università Telematica Pegaso
(controlled by Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. which turns out to be the promoter, in turn wholly-owned by
Multiversity S.r.l.) into a ‘joint stock company’ was completed, undertaken during the 2018 fiscal year. The
process was definitively concluded with the registration in the Register of Companies of Naples, on 25.06.2019,
of the transformation resolution adopted by the BoD on 19.11.2018.

From a legal point of view, the transformation transaction implemented by the University falls within the
so-called ‘progressive heterogeneous transformations’ governed by art. 2500-octies of the Italian Civil Code; the
main effect of this operation was the University’s move from a non-commercial entity to a limited liability
company.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

In February 2019, the indirect subsidiary Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. established Principe di Napoli
S.c.a.r.l. (jointly with the subsidiary Universitas Mercatorum, which holds a 10% stake in the share capital of the
same), a consortium company with the aim of coordinating, carrying out and supporting the procedures and
deeds relating to the implementation, on behalf of the two consortium members (Università Telematica Pegaso
S.r.l. and Universitas Mercatorum), of their respective management programmes. In particular, the company
favours coordination between the shareholders with reference to the concession contract for the management and
use of the property ‘Colonia Montana Principe di Napoli as a Centre for Higher Education and Postgraduate
Studies in the gastronomy and tourism sectors’, stipulated with the Municipality of Agerola in execution of the
award of the open tender procedure announced by means of GC resolution no. 105 of September 14, 2018 and
with subsequent determination of the LLPP (Public Works) and Environment Sector of the aforementioned
Municipality no. 140 of September 19, 2018. The facility was temporarily closed due to the COVID emergency
and is close to the complete resumption of educational activities.

The Parent Company is not subject to management and coordination activities pursuant to Article 2497 of the
Italian Civil Code.

The shareholders’ meeting on November 4, 2019 appointed the auditing company EY S.p.A. asthe statutory
audititors of the separate and consolidated financial statements of Multiversity S.r.l. for the three-year period
2019/2021.

**2. Basis of presentation and consolidation**

**2.1 Basis of presentation**

The valuation criteria adopted for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are in line with those
used by the Parent Company, supplemented where necessary with the accounting principles adopted for
particular items of the consolidated financial statements.

The valuation of the individual items is carried out according to the principles of prudence and accrual
accounting, based on a going concern assumption, taking into account the economic function of the assets and
liabilities, considered as envisaged by art. 2423-bis of the Italian Civil Code.

For the elements of the assets or liabilities that fall under more than one item of the financial statements, the
explanatory notes also outline whether they belong to the items other than those in which they are recorded, if
this is necessary for the purposes of understanding the financial statements.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

Where applicable, the principles and recommendations published by the professional bodies responsible for
accounting were also observed, in order to give a true and fair view of the Group’s equity, financial and
economic situation.

There have been no exceptional cases, incompatible with the general clause of true and fair view, pursuant to
art. 2423, paragraph 5 of the Italian Civil Code, which required an exception to the legal provisions for the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

In compliance with accounting standard OIC 29, no corrections have been made in the consolidated financial
statements for significant errors committed in previous years.

**2.2 Scope and basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of Multiversity S.r.l. and of
the Italian and foreign subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code, which are consolidated on a
line-by-line basis.

For this purpose, the following are considered subsidiaries:

 - companies in which another company holds most of the votes that can be exercised at the ordinary
shareholders’ meeting;

 - companies in which another company has enough votes to exercise a dominant influence in the ordinary
shareholders’ meeting;

In any case, the following are considered subsidiaries:

 - companies over which another has the right, by virtue of a contract or a statutory clause, to exercise a
dominant influence, when the applicable law allows such contracts or clauses;

 - companies in which another, on the basis of agreements with other shareholders, alone controls the majority
of the voting rights.

The equity investments in which the Parent Company holds joint control are also consolidated by applying the
proportional method. Equity investments in associated companies were measured by applying the equity method
_(so-called synthetic consolidation)._

Subsidiaries are excluded from line-by-line consolidation when their inclusion would be irrelevant for the
purposes of representing clearly and in a true and fair manner the equity and financial situation and the economic
result of the group (art. 28, paragraph 2, letter a of Legislative Decree 127/1991).

The table below shows the list of companies included in the consolidated financial statements using the
line-by-line, proportional or equity method:

The financial statements used for the consolidation are those approved by the respective Shareholders’ Meetings
for the year ended December 31, 2019 or, if not yet approved, the draft financial statements of the Group
companies approved by the respective administrative bodies.

The financial statements of some companies included in the consolidation have been reclassified and adjusted to
bring them into line with the accounting principles adopted by the Group; in particular, those of the foreign
companies have been appropriately reclassified to make the balance sheet and financial data and the form of
presentation consistent with that required for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

The consolidation principles adopted for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

 - the financial statements of the subsidiaries included in the consolidation area have been consolidated using
the line-by-line method, which consists in the assumption of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses in
their total amount, regardless of the size of the shareholding held and the attribution to third-party
shareholders, in the items ‘Capital and reserves pertaining to minority interests’ and ‘Profit/(Loss) for the
year attributable to minority interest’, respectively, of the portion of shareholders’ equity and profit/loss for
the year pertaining to them.

 - the financial statements of the companies in which the Parent Company holds joint control are consolidated
by applying the proportional consolidation method, which provides for the proportional inclusion in the
consolidated financial statements of the assets, liabilities, costs, revenues and cash flows of the companies
over which it exercises joint control with shareholders not belonging to the group, considering only the part
of their value corresponding to the interest held directly or indirectly by the parent company.

 - The financial statements of associated companies are valued by applying the equity method, with which the
original cost of the investment changes in the periods following the acquisition of the investment to take
into account the pertinent shares of profits and losses and other changes in the shareholders’ equity of the
investee.

 - The book value of equity investments consolidated using the line-by-line method was eliminated against the
corresponding share of shareholders’ equity, less the result for the year, at the date of first inclusion in the
consolidation (taking into account what is specified in the next point). The difference between the
acquisition cost and the net equity at fair value of the subsidiaries at the consolidation date is allocated,
where possible, to the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries net of deferred taxes, where applicable; any
remaining difference, if positive and if the requirements for recording goodwill provided for by OIC 24 are
met, is recognised in the item ‘Goodwill’ within intangible assets. The residual difference that cannot be
allocated to assets and liabilities and to goodwill is charged to the income statement under item ‘B14 Other
operating expenses.

 - With regard to the date relating to the first inclusion in the scope of consolidation, it should be noted that the
Parent Company, having finalised the transfer described above on 27 October 2019 and not having approved
financial statements close to that date, decided to make use of the option granted by accounting standard
OIC 17 to proceed with the first consolidation on the date in which the company is included in the
consolidation area for the first time, and therefore with effect from December 31, 2019.

 - Goodwill is amortised on the basis of estimated economic use according to its useful life, taking into
account all the information available to determine the period in which the economic benefits will
materialise; in exceptional cases in which it is not possible to reliably estimate their life, it is amortised over
a period not exceeding ten years.

 - If an excess of shareholders’ equity is recognised over the acquisition cost, after having reduced, if
necessary, the values of the assets recorded to their recoverable value and of the liabilities recognised to a
value lower than their settlement value, net of prepaid taxes and having established the ‘Consolidation

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

provision for future risks and charges’ against estimated liabilities, this would be credited to the
consolidated shareholders’ equity under the item ‘Consolidation reserve’. The portion of shareholders
‘equity attributable to minority interests of the consolidated subsidiaries is entered under the item ‘Capital
and reserves pertaining to minority interests’ of the shareholders’ equity, while the minority interests’ share
of the net result is shown separately in the consolidated income statement under the item ‘Profit/(loss) of
pertaining to minority interests’.

 - The credit and debit items between the companies included in the consolidation have been eliminated.

 - The income and charges relating to transactions between the companies included in the consolidation,
starting from the first consolidation, have been eliminated.

 - Significant profits and losses deriving from transactions between companies included in the consolidation
relating to values still included in the balance sheet at the end of the year have been eliminated.

 - Dividends distributed within the group were reversed from the consolidated income statement.

 - The conversion into Euro of financial statements expressed in foreign currencies is carried out using the
‘current exchange rate’ method. The historical exchange rate at the date of first consolidation at
December 31, 2019 was used for the items of shareholders’ equity, the year-end exchange rate for the assets
and liabilities of the balance sheet and the average exchange rate for those of the income statement. Any
foreign exchange translation differences are charged directly to shareholders’ equity in the specific item
‘Translation reserve’.

 - The differences deriving from the elimination of intra-group payables, receivables, costs and revenues in
foreign currencies have been recorded under item ‘17-bis) Exchange gains and losses’.

 - A deferred tax provision has been recorded on not distributable profits and reserves subject to deferred tax
in consideration of any possible future distribution.

**2.3 Valuation criteria applied**

This section presents, in detail, the criteria that contributed to the formation of the individual items of the
consolidated financial statements.

**Assets**

**Non current assets**

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recorded at purchase cost including any accessory costs, financial charges and direct and
indirect costs incurred before the use of the asset, for the portion reasonably attributable to them.

The cost of intangible assets, the use of which is limited over time, is systematically amortised in each fiscal year
according to their residual possibility of use. In particular, depreciation rates are applied that reflect the estimated
economically useful life of the assets.

The rates used are summarised in the following table:

**Category** **Rate**

Goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10%

operation during the 2016 fiscal year.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

The cost of these intangible assets also includes the costs incurred for filing copyrights in the public software
register.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recognised on the date on which the risks and benefits associated with the
acquired assets are transferred and are recognised, within the limit of the recoverable value, at purchase or
production cost net of the related accumulated depreciation, including all costs and directly attributable ancillary
charges, indirect costs relating to internal production, charges relating to the financing of internal manufacturing
incurred during the manufacturing period and up to the time when the asset can be used.

No legal revaluations have been carried out and the maximum limit of the measurements is the value in use,
determined objectively, of the asset itself.

Property, plant and equipment are systematically depreciated each year on the basis of economic-technical rates
determined in relation to the residual possibility of use of the assets, a criterion considered fully represented by
the following depreciation rates, which have remained unchanged with respect to the previous year:

**Write-downs for impairment of tangible and intangible assets**

At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indicator to suggest a fixed asset may have
suffered impairment. If these indicators were to exist, the Group would estimate the recoverable value of the
asset by making a write-down only if the latter were lower than the corresponding net book value. In the absence
of indicators of potential impairment, the recoverable value is not determined.

When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the Group estimates the
recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and its value in use determined
as the present value of estimated future cash flows.

An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value. When, subsequently, a loss on
assets, other than goodwill, ceases or is reduced, the book value of the asset or the cash-generating unit is
increased up to the new estimate of the recoverable value without exceeding the value that would have been
determined if no loss had been detected.

**Financial assets**

**Equity investments**

Equity investments in unconsolidated ‘subsidiaries’ and ‘other equity investments’ are measured at purchase or
subscription cost, including accessory charges and adjusted to take into account any capital losses deemed to be
permanent.

The cost of the equity investments is not maintained, in compliance with the provisions of article 2426,
number 3), of the Italian Civil Code, if, at the end of the fiscal year, the equity investment is permanently lower
than the cost value. Impairment is determined by comparing the book value of the investment with its
recoverable value, based on the future benefits that are expected to flow into the investee’s economy. Impairment
is permanent when, justifiably, the causes of said impairment are not expected to be eliminated in a short period
of time, i.e. in a period so short as to make it possible to formulate reliable forecasts based on objective and

reasonably verifiable facts. If, on the other hand, the investee has prepared plans and programmes aimed at
restoring the conditions of economic-financial equilibrium, with characteristics as such to justify the belief that
the impairment of the investment is temporary, this can be defined as non-permanent.

Equity investments include investments in joint stock companies, consortium companies and consortia. Equity
investments recorded under fixed assets represent a long-lasting and strategic investment by the Group.

In the consolidated financial statements there are no long-term investments for a value higher than their fair
value.

**Receivables**

Receivables originating from revenues for the sale of goods or the provision of services are recognised under
current assets on the basis of the accrual principle when the conditions for the recognition of the related revenues
are met.

Receivables originating for different reasons are recognised if there is a ‘title’ to the receivable and therefore
when they actually represent a third-party obligation to the company; if of a financial nature they are classified
under financial fixed assets, with an indication of the portion due within the next fiscal year.

Receivables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, taking into account the time factor, and
within the limits of their presumed realisable value and, therefore, are shown in the balance sheet net of the
related bad debt provision deemed adequate to cover losses due to reasonably foreseeable non-collectability.

If the interest rate of the transaction is not significantly different from the market rate, the receivable is initially
recorded at a value equal to the nominal value net of all premiums, discounts, rebates and inclusive of any costs
directly attributable to the transaction, which generated the receivable. These transaction costs, any commission
income and expense and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are spread
over the duration of the loan using the effective interest criterion.

On the other hand, when the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is
significantly different from the market rate, the receivable (and the corresponding revenue in the case of
commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows plus any
transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate.

In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition
value of the receivable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as financial
income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate criterion.

In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the
present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial
income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the
transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest
income accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement
with the value of the receivable as a contra entry.

The value of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the amounts received, both by way of principal and
interest, as well as for any write-downs to bring the receivables back to their presumed realisable value or for
losses.

The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and the discounting back
are not relevant when the maturity of the receivables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the
contractual and substantial considerations in place on recognition of the receivable, and the transaction costs and
any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity is of an insignificant amount. In this
case, discounting was omitted, the interest was calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs were entered
among deferrals and amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the receivable to adjust the nominal
interest income.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents, revenue stamps and cash balances resulting from the accounts held by the Group with
credit institutions are allocated to this item, all expressed at their nominal value, specifically converted into
national currency when dealing with accounts in foreign currencies.

**Shareholders’ equity**

This item includes all transactions of a financial nature carried out between the Group and individuals who
exercise their rights and duties as shareholders. The share capital increase is recognised in the accounts only after
the transaction has been entered in the register of companies, as governed by art. 2444, paragraph 2, of the Italian
Civil Code. In this case, the corresponding amount is recognised in a specific item of shareholders’ equity (other
than the item ‘Capital’), which includes the amounts of capital subscribed by the shareholders, which will
subsequently be reclassified upon verification of the conditions described above.

**Provisions for risks and charges**

They are set aside to cover losses or debts of certain or probable existence, whose amount or date of occurrence
could not be determined at the end of the year.

In the measurement of these provisions, the general criteria of prudence and accrual accounting were respected,
and no provision was made for generic risks without economic justification.

Contingent liabilities are recognised in the financial statements and booked under provisions when they are likely
to materialise and when the amount of the related charge can be reasonably estimated.

Any risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible or for which no objective forecast of the
resulting charge is possible are indicated in the Explanatory Notes without accruing provisions for risks and
charges.

Risks whose probability of occurrence appears remote are not considered.

**Employee termination indemnity**

The provision for termination indemnities is set aside to cover the entire liability accrued towards employees, in
compliance with current legislation and collective labour and supplementary company agreements. This liability
is subject to revaluation pursuant to art. 2120 of the Italian Civil Code.

The termination indemnity recognised in the financial statements is given by the total of the individual
indemnities accrued by employees including revaluations, net of the advances paid.

**Payables**

Payables originating from acquisitions of assets are recognised in the balance sheet when significant risks,
charges and benefits associated with ownership have been substantially transferred. Payables relating to services
are recognised when the services have been rendered, that is, the service has been performed.

Financial payables originating from financing transactions and payables arising for reasons other than the
acquisition of goods and services are recognised when the company has an obligation towards the counterparty,
identified in compliance of legal and contractual regulations.

On the other hand, advances received from customers for supplies of goods or services not yet carried out are
included in the item advances.

Payables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, considering the time factor.

If the interest rate of the transaction is not significantly different from the market rate, the payable is initially
recognised at a value equal to the nominal value, net of all transaction costs and all premiums, discounts and
rebate deriving directly from the transaction that generated the payable. These transaction costs, such as ancillary
expenses for obtaining loans, any commission income and expenses and any difference between the initial value
and nominal value at maturity, are spread over the duration of the debt using the effective interest criterion.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

When it appears that the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly
different from the market rate, the payable (and the corresponding cost in the case of commercial transactions) is
initially recognised at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows and taking into account any
transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate.

In the case of payables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value
of the payable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as a financial charge
over the duration of the payable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial payables, the
difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows,
determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income
statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract leads to the
attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest expense accruing on the transaction
is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with the value of the payable as a
contra entry.

The value of the payables is subsequently reduced by the amounts paid, both as principal and interest.

The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortized cost and the discounting back
are not relevant when the due date is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and
substantial considerations in place when the payable is recognised, and the transaction costs and any difference
between the initial value and nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting is
omitted and the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered among deferrals and
amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the payable to adjust the nominal interest expense.

**Payables to group companies**

Items D9, D10 and D11, where present, respectively include payables to subsidiaries (not consolidated),
associated companies and parent companies, as defined pursuant to art. 2359 of the Italian Civil Code. These
payables are indicated separately in the balance sheet.

Item D11 also includes payables to parent companies that control the Group indirectly, through their intermediate
subsidiaries.

Payables to companies subject to common control (so-called sister companies), other than subsidiaries,
associated companies or parent companies, are recognised in item D11-bis.

**Costs and revenue**

Costs and revenue are shown in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the relevant accrual
principle and are shown net of returns, discounts, rebates and premiums.

**Financial income and expenses**

They include all the positive and negative components of the economic result for the year connected with the
financial activity of the Group and are recognised on the basis of the accrual principle.

**Income taxes—Current, Prepaid and Deferred**

Current income taxes are allocated according to the accrual principle on the basis of the tax charges resulting
from the application of the tax legislation in force and are entered among tax payables net of advances.

Deferred and prepaid taxes are determined on the temporary differences between the value attributed to the assets
and liabilities according to statutory criteria and the value attributed to the same assets and liabilities for tax
purposes.

Deferred taxes are entered in the ‘Provision for deferred taxes’, recorded under liabilities among the provisions
for risks and charges, while the prepaid taxes are recorded in the receivables from others under current assets.

F-72


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

Assets deriving from prepaid taxes are not recognised, in compliance with the prudence principle, if there is no
reasonable certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be
reversed, of a taxable income higher than the amount of the differences that will be cancelled. Liabilities for
deferred taxes are recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will reverse in the foreseeable
future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year
in which the tax asset will be realised or the tax liability will be settled, based on the tax legislation established
by the provisions in force at the reporting date.

**Accruals and deferrals**

The portions of costs and income common to two or more fiscal years, according to the matching and accrual
principle, are recorded in these items. Based on this criterion, accruals or deferrals are recognised when the
following conditions are met:

 - the contract begins in one fiscal year and ends in a subsequent one;

 - the consideration for the services is contractually due in advance or in arrears with respect to services
common to two or more consecutive years;

 - the amount of accruals and deferrals varies with the passage of time.

Income and charges that have accrued in full in the fiscal year to which the financial statements refer or in
subsequent ones are not included among accruals and deferrals.

**Conversion criteria for foreign currency items**

In compliance with art. 2426, paragraph 1, no. 8-bis of the Italian Civil Code, monetary assets and liabilities in
currencies other than the functional currency in which the financial statements are presented (so-called
‘accounting currency’), after initial recognition, are recognised at the spot exchange rate on the closing date of
the fiscal year. The consequent gains or losses on foreign exchange are recognised in the income statement under
item C17-bis) ‘foreign exchange gains and losses’ and any net profit, which contributes to the formation of the
operating result, is set aside in a specific reserve that cannot be distributed until realised.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the accounting currency are recognised at the
exchange rate in effect at the time of their acquisition. If the exchange rate in force at the closing date of the
fiscal year is significantly different from that existing at the acquisition date, the exchange rate variation is one of
the elements taken into consideration in the valuation process to determine the value that can be booked in the
financial statements for the individual non-monetary assets. In this case, therefore, any exchange differences
(positive or negative) contribute to the determination of the recoverable value.

**17. Costs for services**

The costs for services mainly include the costs for consultancy and assistance services connected to the
management and development of the intangible assets owned by the company and to administrative/tax services
and the cost of corporate bodies.

**18. Costs for the use of third party assets**

The costs for the use of third party assets for the year ended December 31, 2019 include costs relating to the
rental of company cars for an amount of € 4,404.

**19. Cost of personnel**

The item includes the entire expenditure for employees including social security contributions, the cost of unused

**20. Amortisation of intangible assets**

The item includes the amortisation of intangible assets which, except for start-up costs, derive from the transfer
of the business unit.

**21. Depreciation of tangible assets**

The item includes the depreciation of other tangible assets deriving from the transfer of a business unit.

**22. Other operating expenses**

The other management charges, equal to € 353 as of December 31, 2018, include the stamp duty paid virtually
for € 43 and the government licence fee for € 310.

**23. Income taxes for the year—current, deferred and prepaid**

The income tax charge, pertaining to the year, is determined in compliance with current legislation.

Deferred and prepaid taxes are determined on the basis of the temporary differences between the values of assets
and liabilities and the corresponding values relevant for tax purposes.

In particular, prepaid taxes are recorded only if there is a reasonable certainty of their future recovery. Deferred
taxes, on the other hand, are not recognised if there is little probability that the related payable will arise.

Current taxes amount to € 226,359, relating entirely to IRES.

It should be noted that in determining the taxes for the year, the Company made use of the tax relief provisions of
the so-called ‘Patent box’, which made it possible to take advantage of a tax reduction, for IRES and IRAP
purposes, of 50% of taxable income deriving from the indirect use of intangible assets.

The use of deferred taxes, equal to € 267,081, relates to the amortisation of the brand and the intellectual property
conferred during the year.

With the Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of March 1, 2020 ‘Further implementing provisions
of the decree-law of February 23, 2020, n. 6’, containing urgent measures regarding the containment and
management of the epidemiological emergency from COVID-19 and published in GU (Official Journal) Special
Series no. 52 of March 1, 2020, among other things, the temporary closure of the Universities and Institutions of
Higher Artistic, Musical and Choreutic Education was arranged, without prejudice to the possibility of carrying
out distance learning activities. By means of subsequent memoranda and implementing provisions, starting from
March 2020, universities and AFAM institutions were entitled, in the exercise of their autonomy, to prioritise
alternative distance-based methods, mid-course examinations, including graduation sessions, which can be
carried out using remote access methods.

These provisions, if reasonably confirmed also following the resolution of the COVID emergency, constitute a
change of epic proportions in the processes on which traditional teaching is based, contributing significantly to
the promotion of modern and indeed more democratic and global university education, helping to create a
‘Global University’ with the same technology, philosophy, values and methods able to make students feel at
home in every university in the various countries of the world and allow the creation of multiple learning,
interdisciplinary and multicultural channels.

Further assessments are carried out through continuous monitoring of the regulatory context and of all the
provisions of the bodies in charge in order to guarantee the full safety of workers.

With reference to the performance of Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l, the Group’s main strategic asset, in the
period of pandemic emergency, it should be noted that the indirect subsidiary, given the method of providing
courses in e-learning mode, did not suffer any impact on the performance of enrolments compared to the same
period of the previous year.

In January 2020, the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. entered into a revolving loan agreement with a leading
bank for a maximum limit, in the event of drawdown, of € 15 million, with Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A.
and Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. guarantors in the event of any default by the Company. The loan was not
used by the Parent Company at the date of preparation of this document.

As described in the paragraph Provisions for risks and charges, please note that on November 20, 2019 a tax
audit was initiated by the Italian Revenue Agency for Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. and Università
Telematica S.r.l. for the years prior to the transformation of the Pegaso University to a joint stock company for
the tax years from 2015 to 2019. Audit activities are currently under way.

It should be noted that in May 2020, as part of the facilitation measures issued by the Italian government
following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Legislative Decree no. 34 of May 19, 2020 on ‘Urgent
measures in the field of health, support for work and the economy, as well as social policies related to the
epidemiological emergency from COVID-19’, exemption from payment of the IRAP balance relating to 2019,
was given to companies with total revenues not exceeding € 250,000,000. The companies of the Group,
therefore, falling into the above category, in the preparation of the UNICO2020 model, relating to the fiscal year
2019, will account for contingent assets equal to the amount of the payable recorded in the financial statements
as at December 31, 2019, relating to the tax IRAP not due.

The valuation criteria set forth herein comply with the statutory regulations and the results of the consolidated
financial statements correspond to the accounting records kept in compliance with the regulations in force. These
explanatory notes, as well as the entire financial statements of which they constitute an integral part, give a true
and fair view of the equity and financial situation of the Group and the economic result for the year.

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

**Independent auditor’s report pursuant to article 14 of Legislative Decree n. 39, dated January 27, 2010**
**(Translation from the original Italian text)**

To the Sole Shareholder of
Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l.

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**_Opinion_**

We have audited the financial statements of Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. (the Company), which comprise
the balance sheet as at December 31, 2020, the income statement and statement of cash flows for the year then
ended, and explanatory notes.

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at
December 31, 2020, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance
with the Italian regulations governing financial statements.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
_Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the regulations and_
standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian Laws. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements**

The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in
accordance with the Italian regulations governing financial statements, and, within the terms provided by the law,
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and, when
preparing the financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, and for appropriate
disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless they either
intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The statutory audit committee (“Collegio Sindacale”) is responsible, within the terms provided by the law, for
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the [ financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have exercised
professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:

 - we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

 - we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control;

 - we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors;

 - we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this matter in
forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a
going concern;

 - we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that achieves fair presentation.

We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by
ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

**Report on compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements**

**_Opinion pursuant to article 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legislative Decree n. 39 dated January 27,_**
**_2010_**

The Directors of Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. are responsible for the preparation of the Report on
Operations[1] of Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l.as at December 31, 2020, including its consistency with the
related financial statements and its compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.

We have performed the procedures required under audit standard SA Italia n. 720B, in order to express an
opinion on the consistency of the Report on Operations, with the financial statements of Università Telematica
Pegaso S.r.l. as at December 31, 2020 and on its compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, and in
order to assess whether it contains material misstatements.

In our opinion, the Report on Operations is consistent with the financial statements of Università Telematica
Pegaso S.r.l.as at December 31, 2020 and comply with the applicable laws and regulations.

With reference to the statement required by art. 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legislative Decree n. 39,
dated January 27, 2010, based on our knowledge and understanding of the entity and its environment obtained
through our audit, we have no matters to report.

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

**1. Introduction and other information**

This document represents the financial statements as at December 31, 2020 which closed with a profit of the
fiscal year of € 54,050,021 net of taxes pertaining to the fiscal year for € 23,681,943.

The Financial Statements of Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. (hereinafter also referred to as the “University”)
closed on December 31, 2020 were prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Italian Civil Code, as
amended by Italian Legislative Decree 139/2015, interpreted and integrated by the Italian accounting standards
issued by the Italian Accounting Body (“OIC”) in the version in force for the financial statements as at
December 31, 2020.

The Financial Statements consist of the Balance Sheet (prepared in accordance with the format provided by
Art. 2424 and 2424 bis of the Italian Civil Code), the Income Statement (prepared in accordance with the format
referred to in Art. 2425 and 2425 bis of Italian Civil Code), the Cash Flow Statement (whose content, in
compliance with Art. 2425-ter of the Italian Civil Code, is presented in accordance with the provisions of the
OIC 10 accounting standard) and by these Explanatory Notes, prepared in accordance with the provisions of
Art. 2427 and 2427-bis of the Italian Civil Code.

The entire document, in the parts of which it is composed, has been prepared to give a true and fair representation
of the Company’s equity and financial situation, as well as of the economic result for the year, providing
additional information complementary to this purpose where necessary.

In relation to the content of the Explanatory Notes pursuant to art. 2427 of the Italian Civil Code:

 - the Company did not issue bonds and/or similar financial instruments;

 - the Company did not carry out any financing transactions including the temporary sale of assets during the
2020 fiscal year;

 - the Company did not borrow any assets against the payment of a sum of money as a security deposit;

 - the Company has no off-balance sheet agreements in place beyond what is reported in both these
Explanatory Notes and in the Report on Operations, whose knowledge is useful for assessing the company’s
equity and financial situation;

 - no atypical or unusual transactions, or unrelated to the normal management of the company or capable of
significantly affecting the Company’s economic and equity situation, were carried out;

 - the Company has not issued dividend-right shares and bonds convertible into shares, or securities or similar
values pursuant to art. 2427, first paragraph 18 of the Italian Civil Code;

 - the Company does not have any separate assets or loans intended for a specific transaction pursuant to
art. 2447 bis et sec. of the Italian Civil Code.

**a. Activities carried out**

Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l., established by Ministerial Decree of April 20, 2006 (OJ no. 118 of May 23,
2006—Ordinary Supplement 125), is a University founded on the most modern and effective e-learning
technological standards. It makes use of modern educational systems and methodologies capable of responding
to the various needs of today’s society. Study courses provide a high degree of independence and educational
path personalisation, without any physical presence constraints but with constant interaction. Despite their
peculiarities, at the same time, courses allow students to be followed and monitored through their continuous
learning, also through frequent opportunities for evaluation and self-evaluation.

The company uses IT and remote access technologies and adopts a system architecture capable of managing and
making high quality online university courses accessible to the user. The teaching support specialists who work
alongside teaching staff (Tutors, Mentors and Coaches) assist the learner throughout their course of study, in
order to achieve a perfect learning balance based on the achievement of one’s potential. Highly technological and
interactive tools, TV learning and social learning involve the student in a truly unique and effective educational
experience. Academic qualifications awarded at the end of study courses have the same legal value as
qualifications issued by traditional universities.

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

In the context of the educational offer, both graduate and postgraduate courses are available.

The income generated by courses derives entirely from the fees and ancillary contributions paid by the learners
for the use of courses in e-learning mode. These are mainly fees for single-cycle master’s degree courses (Law),
three-year degree courses (Civil Engineering, Business Economics, Tourism Sciences, Sport Sciences, Education
and Training Sciences), two-year master’s degree courses (Education Sciences, Economic Sciences, Sport
Management and Sport Sciences, and Safety Engineering), as well as master’s, postgraduate courses and higher
education courses.

The University, unlike most of the Italian public and private universities, does not receive the usual contributions
paid by the State, including the ordinary MIUR funding (“FFO”), or by other public or private entities, aimed at
covering management and operating costs without any result-linked constraint.

The company also pays great attention to national and international research activities, as well as to the
promotion of training of younger generations in research activities.

Both within and outside of the EU, consistently with the general principles set out in its Articles of Association,
Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. promotes the international development of education, research and studies,
also and in particular through cultural exchanges between different countries and collaboration with the most
prestigious universities within the Community area.

Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. has offices located throughout Italy, in many cases within the most
prestigious palaces and monumental town complexes, places with the highest historical and cultural profile, also
testifying to the University’s authority and the consideration it enjoys among institutions, which have recognised
its commitment, quality and high educational profile, and therefore allowed the use of their premises.

In recent years, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. has achieved ever-increasing positive results by focusing on
innovative projects, on the quality of its research, training processes and services. The University aims to play a
driving role in cultural and economic development at the local, national and international level. For this reason, it
has deemed it appropriate, as better described below, to change its legal form into one more suitable for a larger
entity, also in accordance with the new and broader objectives that the entire education sector must focus on,
following the profound social and economic transformations which, inevitably, have also had strong
repercussions on education and training.

During the fiscal year, the activity was carried out on a regular basis; there were no events that significantly
changed the management performance and which made it necessary to resort to the exceptions referred to in
art. 2423, paragraph 5, of the Italian Civil Code.

**b. Significant events that occurred during the year**

With regard to the performance for the year and the future prospects of the Company, the following is set out.

With the Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of March 1, 2020 “Further implementing provisions
of the decree-law of February 23, 2020, no. 6”, containing urgent measures regarding the containment and
management of the epidemiological emergency from COVID-19 and published in GU Special Series no. 52 of
March 1, 2020, among other things, the temporary closure of the Universities and Institutions of Higher Artistic,
Musical and Choreutic Education was arranged, without prejudice to the possibility of carrying out distance
learning activities. With subsequent acts and implementing provisions, starting from March 2020, universities
and AFAM institutions were entitled, in the exercise of their autonomy, to prioritise alternative remote methods,
progress examinations, including graduation sessions, which can be carried out using remote access methods.
These provisions, if reasonably confirmed also following the resolution of the COVID emergency, constitute a
change of epic proportions in the processes on which traditional teaching is based, contributing in a dramatic
manner to the promotion of a modern and indeed more democratic and global university education, functional to
the creation of a ‘Global University’ with the same technology, philosophy, values and methods able to make
students feel at home in every university in the various countries of the world and allow the creation of multiple
learning, interdisciplinary and multicultural channels.

The University immediately activated all the necessary measures to allow all employees to work remotely in
order to guarantee their full safety and at the same time the operation of all activities.

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

Finally, it should be noted that in January 2020 the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. stipulated a revolving
loan agreement with a primary credit institution for a maximum use, in the event of a drawdown, of € 15 million,
with Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. guarantor in the event of any default by the Parent Company. The loan
was not used by the Parent Company at the date of preparation of this document.

**2. Basis of presentation**

In accordance with the provisions of art. 2423-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the following standards were adopted
in the preparation of the Financial Statements:

 - the valuation of the individual items was made based on principles of prudence and with a going concern
view, as well as by taking into account the economic function of the asset or liability element considered;

 - only the profits actually realised during the year have been included;

 - the income and expenses for the year have been included, regardless of their numerical manifestation;

 - the risks and losses pertaining to the year were taken into account, even if they became known after its
closure;

 - the heterogeneous elements included in the various items of the financial statements were assessed
separately;

 - the valuation criteria adopted were the same as those of the previous year.

The Balance Sheet and the Income Statement are prepared in Euro units, rounding the amounts up or down, in
accordance to the provision of the EU Regulation; also in the explanatory notes, amounts are expressed in Euro
units as they guarantee a better document clarity.

For assets and liabilities elements that fall under more than one item of the financial statements, the explanatory
notes also note whether they pertain to items other than those in which they are recorded, if this is necessary for
the purposes of understanding the financial statements.

Where applicable, the principles and recommendations published by the professional bodies responsible for
accounting were also observed, always in order to give a true and fair view of the equity, financial and economic
situation.

There have been no exceptional cases, incompatible with the general clause of true and correct representation,
pursuant to art. 2423, fifth paragraph of the Italian Civil Code, which imposed an exception to the provisions of
the Law for the preparation of the Financial Statements.

In accordance with the provisions of art. 2423-bis, point 6, of the Italian Civil Code, the valuation criteria were
not changed from one year to another and there were no exceptional cases such as to justify an exception to this
principle, pursuant to paragraph 2 of the same article.

In compliance with accounting standard OIC 29, no corrections have been made in the Financial Statements for
significant errors committed in previous years.

**2.1 Valuation criteria applied**

This section presents, in detail, the criteria that contributed to the calculation of the individual items in the
financial statements.

**Assets**

**Non current assets**

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recorded at purchase cost including accessory and financial charges, and direct and indirect
costs incurred before the use of the asset, for the portion reasonably attributable to them.

F-93


-----

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

The cost of intangible assets, whose use is limited over time, is systematically amortised in each fiscal year
according to their residual possible use. In particular, amortisation rates are applied that reflect the estimated
useful life of the assets.

The rates used are summarised in the following table:

**Category** **Rate**

Start-up and expansion costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20%
Industrial patent and intellectual property rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20%
Concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20%
Other intangible assets:

_- Improvements on third party assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ _Based on the lease agreement or 20%_

- Usufruct on real estate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _8.33%_

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment, whose use is limited in time, are recognised in the financial statements at
purchase cost, including directly attributable accessory charges, and have been depreciated on a straight-line
basis, based on the useful life of the assets and taking into account their residual possibility of use, physical wear,
technological evolution and obsolescence.

Maintenance costs of an ordinary nature have been charged in full to the income statement, while those of an
incremental nature (expansion, modernisation or improvement), connected to an increase in the production
capacity or safety of the asset or an extension of its useful life, are attributed to the assets to which they refer and
are depreciated in relation to the residual possibility of use of the same.

The depreciation rates used are summarised in the following table:

**Category** **Rate**

Plants and equipment:

_- Generic plants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ _15%_

**Write-downs for impairment of intangible assets**

At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether there are indicators to suggest that an asset may have
suffered an impairment. If such an indicator is present, the Company estimates the recoverable value of the asset
and writes it down only if this is lower than the corresponding net book value. In the absence of indicators of
potential impairment, the recoverable value is not calculated.

When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the Company estimates the
recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of their fair value net of sales costs and its value in use
determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows.

An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value. Subsequently, when the
impairment of an asset, other than goodwill, no longer applies or is reduced, the book value of the asset or of the
cash-generating unit is increased to the new estimate of the recoverable value without exceeding the value that
would have been determined if no impairment had been detected.

**Financial assets**

**Equity investments**

Controlling, associate and joint venture equity investments, if not valued at cost, are recognised using the equity
method in compliance with art. 2426, number 4, of the Italian Civil Code and according to the indications of the

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

OIC 17. Equity investments accounted for using the equity method are initially recognised at purchase cost,
including ancillary charges.

On initial recognition, the purchase cost of the equity investment is compared with the value of the corresponding
share of the shareholders’ equity resulting on the purchase date or on the date resulting from the last financial
statements of the investee. An initial positive difference (i.e. when the cost incurred for the purchase of the equity
investment is higher than the corresponding fraction of the shareholders’ equity of the investee) is maintained in
the book value of the equity investment if it is attributable to higher values of the assets in the investee’s balance
sheet or in the presence of goodwill, and indicating the reasons for it in the Explanatory Notes; this difference
must be amortised for the part attributable to depreciable assets, including goodwill. Otherwise, the initial value
of the equity investment is written down and the difference is recognised in the income statement under
item D19a) “write-downs of equity investments”. In the presence of an initial negative difference (i.e. when the
cost incurred for the purchase of the equity investment is lower than the corresponding fraction of shareholders’
equity of the investee), if this is not attributable to the forecast of losses but to the completion of a good business,
the equity investment is entered at the higher value of the adjusted shareholders’ equity of the investee company
with respect to the cost price, recognising in a non-distributable reserve under the item AVI “Other reserves” the
capital gains on of the equity investments acquired as a counter-entry. If the initial negative difference is instead
due to the presence of assets recorded for values higher than their recoverable value or liabilities recorded at a
value lower than their extinction value or, again, to the forecast of unfavourable economic results, the equity
investment is initially recognised for a value equal to the cost incurred.

The original book value of the equity investment is modified in the periods following the acquisition to take into
account the portions pertaining to profits and losses and other changes in the shareholders’ equity of the investee.
In particular, the investee’s profit or loss for the year, duly adjusted to eliminate the effects of intra-companies
transactions and to take into account any other adjustments necessary according to OIC 17, are recognised in the
Income Statement of the investee, for the portion pertaining to it, according to the accruals principle in item D18
a) “revaluations of equity investments” or D19 a) “write-downs of equity investments” with a counter entry,
respectively, in the increase or decrease in the related items of the equity investments recorded in fixed assets.

If the shareholders’ equity of the investee increases, as a result of monetary revaluation pursuant to special laws,
or decreases, due to a reduction in share capital or distribution of reserves, the value of the shareholding will be
respectively increased or reduced in the investing company’s balance sheet and that of the non-distributable
reserve. In any case, these changes are not recognised in the income statement.

In the case of capital operations that modify the measure of the shareholders’ equity of the investee pertaining to
the Company, the change in the value of the equity investment is recorded in the same way as a realisation
transaction carried out with third parties which increases or reduces the value of the equity investment with a
corresponding entry respectively in item D18 a) “write-downs of equity investments” or D19 a) “write-downs of
equity investments”.

The book value of the equity investment is written down in the presence of permanent losses in value, determined
by comparing the book value of the equity investment with its recoverable value, calculated on the basis of the
future benefits that are expected to flow into the investor’s economy. This occurs when the loss in value is caused
by factors internal or external to the Company, or to a combination of them, and it is not expected that the
reasons that caused it can be eliminated in a short period of time. All evaluations are carried out separately for
each individual equity investment.

Equity investments include investments in joint stock companies, consortium companies and consortia. Equity
investments recorded under fixed assets represent long-lasting and strategic investments by the company.

**Receivables**

Receivables originating from revenues for the sale of goods or the provision of services are recognised under
current assets on the basis of the accrual principle when the conditions for the recognition of the related revenues
are met.

Receivables originating for different reasons are recognised if there is a ‘title’ to the receivable and therefore
when they actually represent an obligation by third parties towards the company; if of a financial nature, they are
classified under financial fixed assets, with indication of the portion due within the next fiscal year.

-----

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

Receivables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, taking into account the time factor, and
within the limits of their presumed realisable value and, therefore, are shown in the balance sheet net of the
related bad debt provision deemed adequate to cover losses due to reasonably predicted bad debt.

If the transaction’s interest rate is not significantly different from the market rate, the receivable is initially
recorded at a value equal to the nominal value net of all premiums, discounts, rebates and inclusive of any costs
directly attributable to the transaction that generated the receivable. These transaction costs, any commission
income and expense and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are spread
over the duration of the loan using the effective interest criterion.

On the other hand, when the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is
significantly different from the market rate, the receivable (and the corresponding revenue in the case of
commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows plus any
transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate.

In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition
value of the receivable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as financial
income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate criterion.

In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the
present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial
income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the
transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest
income accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement
with an offsetting entry against the value of the receivable.

The value of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the amounts received, both by way of principal and
interest, as well as for any write-downs to bring the receivables to their presumed realisable value or for losses.

The Company assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and of its discount are
irrelevant when the maturity of the receivables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual
and substantive considerations in place at the time the credit is recognised, and the transaction costs and any
difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case,
discounting is omitted, the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered under
deferrals and amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the receivable to adjust the nominal interest
income.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents, revenue stamps and cash balances resulting from the accounts held by the Company
with credit institutions are allocated to this item, all expressed at their nominal value, specifically converted into
national currency in the case of accounts in foreign currencies.

**Shareholders’ equity**

This item includes all the transactions of a financial nature carried out between the Company and subjects who
exercise their rights and duties as shareholders. The share capital increase is recognised in the accounts only after
the transaction has been entered in the companies’ register, as governed by art. 2444, paragraph 2, of the Italian
Civil Code. In this case, the corresponding amount is recognised in a specific item of shareholders’ equity (other
than the item ‘Share capital’), which includes the amounts of share capital subscribed by the shareholders, which
will be subsequently reclassified when the conditions described above are met.

**Provisions for risks and charges**

They are set aside to cover losses or debts of certain or probable existence, whose amount or date of occurrence
could not be determined at the end of the year.

In the valuation of these provisions, the general criteria of prudence and accrual were respected and no provision
was made for generic risks without economic justification.

F-96


-----

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

Potential liabilities are recognised in the financial statements and recorded in the provisions when their
manifestation is considered probable and when the amount of the related charge can be reasonably estimated.

Any risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible or for which no objective forecast of the
resulting charge is possible are indicated in the Explanatory Notes without making allocations to provisions for
risks and charges.

Risks whose probability of occurrence appears remote are not taken into account.

**Employee termination indemnity**

The provision for employee termination indemnity is set aside to cover the entire liability accrued towards
employees, in compliance with current legislation and collective employment and supplementary company
agreements. This liability is subject to revaluation pursuant to art. 2120 of the Italian Civil Code.

The employee termination indemnity recognised in the financial statements is given by the total of the individual
indemnities accrued by employees, including revaluations, net of the advances paid, and taking into account the
effects of the reform introduced by Law no. 296 (2007 Finance Law) of 27 December 2006, on the allocation of
employee termination indemnity provision (to the INPS treasury fund or other selected entities).

As a result of this reform, the employee termination indemnity accrued up to December 31, 2006 remain in the
company and contribute to forming the provision for employee termination indemnity accrued in the financial
statements.

Starting from January 1, 2007, the employee termination indemnity accrued during the year are charged to the
income statement and are reflected, for the part still to be paid to the INPS Treasury Fund or other funds, under
current payables in item D14.

**Payables**

Payables originating from acquisitions of assets are recognised in the balance sheet when significant risks,
charges and benefits associated with their ownership have been substantially transferred. Payables relating to
services are recognised when the services have been rendered, that is, the service has been performed.

Financial payables arising for financing transactions and payables arising for reasons other than the acquisition of
goods and services are recognised when the company has an obligation towards the counterparty, identified on
the basis of legal and contractual regulations.

The advances received from customers for the supply of services not yet carried out are included in the item
advances.

Payables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, taking into account the time factor.

If the transaction’s interest rate is not significantly different from the market rate, the payable is initially
recognised at a value equal to the nominal value, net of all transaction costs and all premiums, discounts and
rebates deriving directly from the transaction that generated the payable. These transaction costs, such as
ancillary expenses for obtaining loans, any commission income and expenses and any difference between the
initial value and nominal value at maturity, are spread over the duration of the payable using the effective interest
criterion.

On the other hand, when the transaction’s interest rate inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly
different from the market rate, the payable (and the corresponding cost in the case of commercial transactions) is
initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows, taking into account any transaction
costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate.

In the case of payables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value
of the payable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as a financial charge
over the duration of the payable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial payables, the

F-97


-----

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows,
determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income
statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract suggests the
attribution a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest expense accruing on the transaction is
calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with an offsetting entry against the
value of the payable.

The value of the payables is subsequently reduced by the amounts paid, both in terms of the principal and of
interest.

The Company assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and the discount are
irrelevant when the due date of payables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and
substantial considerations in place when the payable is recognised, and the costs transaction and any difference
between initial value and nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting is
omitted and the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered under deferrals and
amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the payable to adjust the nominal interest expense.

**Payables to group companies**

Items D9, D10 and D11 respectively include payables to subsidiaries, associates and parent companies, as
defined pursuant to art. 2359 of the Italian Civil Code. These payables are indicated separately in the balance
sheet.

Item D11 also includes payables to parent companies that indirectly control the Company, through their
intermediate subsidiaries.

Payables to companies subject to common control (‘sister companies’), other than subsidiaries, associates or
parent companies, are recognised in item D11-bis.

**Revenue**

Revenues from the provision of services are recognised on the date on which the services are completed or, for
those dependent on contracts with periodic payments, on the date of accrual of the payments.

Sales revenue are recognised net of returns, discounts, allowances and bonuses, as well as taxes directly
connected with the sale, the provision of services and adjustments to revenues for the year are directly deducted
from the item revenues.

The item “other revenues and income” includes positive non-financial income components deriving entirely from
ancillary management.

**Costs**

Purchase costs are recognised on an accruals basis. The costs for raw and ancillary materials, consumables and
goods include accessory purchase costs (transport, insurance, loading and unloading, etc.) if included by the
supplier in the purchase price of the same, otherwise they are recognised separately under costs for services
according to their nature.

Not only costs of a certain amount, but also those not yet documented for which the transfer of ownership has
already taken place or the service has already been received, are recognised under costs.

**Financial income and expenses**

They include all the positive and negative components of the economic result for the year connected with the
company’s financial asset and are recognised on an accrual basis.

**Income taxes—Current, Prepaid and Deferred**

Current income taxes are allocated according to the accrual principle on the basis of the tax charges resulting
from the application of the tax legislation in force and are entered under tax payables net of advances.

F-98


-----

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

Deferred and prepaid taxes are determined on the temporary differences between the value attributed to the assets
and liabilities according to statutory criteria and the value attributed to the same assets and liabilities for tax
purposes.

Deferred taxes are entered under the ‘Deferred tax reserve’ recorded under liabilities among the provisions for
risks and charges, while prepaid taxes are recorded under receivables from others under current assets.

Assets deriving from prepaid taxes are not recognised, in compliance with the principle of prudence, if there is no
reasonable certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be
reversed, of a taxable income higher than the amount of the differences to be cancelled. Liabilities for deferred
taxes are recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will be reversed in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year in which
the tax assets will be realised or the tax liability will be extinguished, based on the tax legislation established by
provisions in force at the reference date of the financial statements.

**Accruals and deferrals**

The portions of costs and income common to two or more fiscal years are recorded under these items, according
to the criterion of economic and temporal competence. Based on this criterion, accruals or deferrals are
recognised when the following conditions are met:

 - the contract begins in one fiscal year and ends in a subsequent one;

 - the consideration for the services is contractually due in advance or in arrears with respect to services
common to two or more consecutive years;

 - the amount of accruals and deferrals varies with the passage of time.

Income and charges whose accrual has matured in full in the fiscal year to which the financial statements refer or
in subsequent ones are not included under accruals and deferrals.

**Conversion criteria for foreign currency items**

In compliance with art. 2426, paragraph 1, no. 8-bis of the Italian Civil Code, monetary assets and liabilities in
currencies other than the functional currency in which the financial statements are presented (‘accounting
currency’), are recognised at the spot exchange rate on the closing date of the exercise after initial recognition.
The consequent gains or losses on foreign exchange are recognised in the income statement under item C17-bis)
‘profits and losses on foreign exchange’ and any net profit, which contributes to the calculation of the operating
result, is set aside in a specific non-distributable reserve until realisation.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the accounting currency are recognised at the
exchange rate in effect at the time of their purchase. If the exchange rate in force at the closing date of the fiscal
year is significantly different from that at the acquisition date, the exchange rate variation is one of the elements
taken into consideration in the valuation process to determine the book value of individual non-monetary assets
in the financial statements. In this case, therefore, any exchange differences (positive or negative) contribute to
the determination of the recoverable value.

and, with the help of trusted consultants, the company is promptly responding to the requests and questions
raised.

On the basis of the current state of the checks and in the absence of findings received to date, no areas of possible
criticality are detected and, consequently, there is no evidence of the existence of any prerequisites to make

**39. Accruals to provisions for risks**

This item includes the allocation to the provision to cover losses on equity investments and that relating to

signed between the main E-learning Centre Points (ECPs”) and the University, which provides for the consensual
termination of the agreements in place effective from 1 January 2020, based on the payment of a total amount of
€ 4 million, in the form of compensation, and a total consideration of approximately € 16,600.00 per month, plus

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020**

VAT, for the entire five-year duration of a series of obligations undertaken by said ECPs, including the
obligation of not undertaking activities in competition with those of the University. The transaction was
formalised due to the decision to internalise the main activities carried out by the ECPs at the University
structures. Therefore, this operation falls within a broader context of reorganisation of the group’s structure, also
in order to optimise internal processes.

The following table shows the changes in the item “Financial income” compared to the previous year:

**2020** **2019** **Change** **%**

**2020** **2019** **Change** **%**

Financial company interests . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,262 13,007 (4,745) -36%

Interest and other financial charges, equal to € 8,926, are attributable to:

 - interest paid to financial companies for granting deferred payments to students for € 8,262;

 - interest expense for late payment of taxes for € 664.

The significant difference compared to the previous year is due to the termination of the promotion and support
contract signed on October 14, 2010 between the University and the Promoter (Università Telematica Pegaso
S.p.A.) and resolved by consensus starting from the fiscal year 2020, given the changed legal status of the
University after its conversion into a joint stock company in 2019. Furthermore, the Promoter has undertaken, for
as long as it holds the role of partner and promoter of the University, to provide the latter, through capital
payments, the financial resources that would be necessary in the event of significant losses, indispensable and
instrumental for the functioning of the University and for the pursuit of its aims

**43. Income taxes for the year—current, deferred and prepaid**

The income tax charge pertaining to the year is determined on the basis of current legislation.

Deferred and prepaid taxes are determined on the basis of the temporary differences between the values of assets
and liabilities and the corresponding values for tax purposes.

In particular, prepaid taxes are recorded only if there is a reasonable certainty of their future recovery. Deferred
taxes, on the other hand, are not recognised if there is a low probability that the related payable will arise.

The following table shows the changes in the item “Income taxes, current, deferred and prepaid” compared to the
previous year:

**2020** **2019** **Change** **%**

IRES for the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19,949,306 1,801,248 18,148,058 1008%
IRAP for the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,433,353 1,684,376 2,748,977 163%
Taxes from previous years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (658,707) — (658,707) 100%
Deferred tax assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (42,009) (72,809) 30,800 (42)%

The increase in taxes for the year is mainly due to the economic impact of the consensual termination of the
contractual relationship of promotion and support, starting from January, 2020, as well as to the increase in the
tax base due to the significant increase in the Company’s value of production.

presented on the 12 courses active in the academic year 2020/2021 in order to be able to submit the request for
the establishment of new Study Programs for the purposes of Accreditation for the academic year 2021-2022
taking into consideration the data relating to the two previous years (MIUR circular reference 29229 of
October 23, 2020).

On May 2, 2021 a bill was approved in the Senate, awaiting publication in the gazette, concerning the
amendment to article 142 of the consolidated act referred to in the royal decree no. 1592 of August 31, 1933,
concerning the abolition of the ban on simultaneous enrolment at different universities, at different faculties or
schools of the same university and at different degree or diploma courses of the same faculty or school. This

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

**Independent auditor’s report pursuant to article 14 of Legislative Decree n. 39, dated January 27, 2010**
**(Translation from the original Italian text)**

To the Sole Shareholder of
Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l.

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. (the Company), which comprise
the balance sheet as at December 31, 2019, the income statement and statement of cash flows for the year then
ended, and explanatory notes.

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at
December 31, 2019, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance
with the Italian regulations governing financial statements.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
_Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the regulations and_
standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian Laws. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Other matters**

Our audit was carried out in the context arisen as a result of the COVID 19 outbreak and related measures,
including restrictions of movement, issued by the Italian Government to protect the health of citizens.
Consequently, due to circumstances of force majeure, our audit procedures, defined by the professional
standards, have been carried out in the context of (i) a rescheduled personnel organization, based on a wide use of
working from home and (ii) of different ways of interfacing with the company employees and gathering
evidence, through the use, for the most part, of electronic documentation transmitted to us with techniques of
communication at distance.

**Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements**

The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in
accordance with the Italian regulations governing financial statements, and, within the terms provided by the law,
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and, when
preparing the financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, and for appropriate
disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless they either
intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The statutory audit committee (“Collegio Sindacale”) is responsible, within the terms provided by the law, for
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have exercised
professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:

 - we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

 - we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control;

 - we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors;

 - we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this matter in
forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a
going concern;

 - we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that achieves fair presentation.

We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by
ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

**Report on compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements**

**Opinion pursuant to article 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legislative Decree n. 39 dated**
**January 27, 2010**

The Directors of Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. are responsible for the preparation of the Report on
Operations[1] of Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. as at December 31, 2019, including its consistency with the
related financial statements and its compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.

We have performed the procedures required under audit standard SA Italia n. 720B, in order to express an
opinion on the consistency of the Report on Operations, with the financial statements of Università Telematica
Pegaso S.r.l. as at December 31, 2019 and on its compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, and in
order to assess whether it contains material misstatements.

In our opinion, the Report on Operations is consistent with the financial statements of Università Telematica
Pegaso S.r.l. as at December 31, 2019 and comply with the applicable laws and regulations.

With reference to the statement required by art. 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legislative Decree n. 39,
dated January 27, 2010, based on our knowledge and understanding of the entity and its environment obtained
through our audit, we have no matters to report.

in addition to those of December 2016, the new elements of the amendments to the OIC accounting standards 12,

**a. Activities carried out**

Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l., established by Ministerial Decree of April 20, 2006 (OJ no. 118 of May 23,
2006—Ordinary Supplement 125), is a University founded on the most modern and effective e-learning
technological standards. It makes use of modern educational systems and methodologies capable of responding
to the various needs of today’s society. Study courses provide a high degree of independence and educational
path personalisation, without any physical presence constraints but with constant interaction. Despite their
peculiarities, at the same time, courses allow students to be followed and monitored through their continuous
learning, also through frequent opportunities for evaluation and self-evaluation.

The company uses IT and remote access technologies and adopts a system architecture capable of managing and
making high quality online university courses accessible to the user. The teaching support specialists who work

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

alongside teaching staff (Tutors, Mentors and Coaches) assist the learner throughout their course of study, in
order to achieve a perfect learning balance based on the achievement of one’s potential. Highly technological and
interactive tools, TV learning and social learning involve the student in a truly unique and effective educational
experience. Academic qualifications awarded at the end of study courses have the same legal value as
qualifications issued by traditional universities.

In the context of the educational offer, both graduate and postgraduate courses are available.

The income generated by courses derives entirely from the fees and ancillary contributions paid by the learners
for the use of courses in e-learning mode. These are mainly fees for single-cycle master’s degree courses (Law),
three-year degree courses (Civil Engineering, Business Economics, Tourism Sciences, Sport Sciences, Education
and Training Sciences), two-year master’s degree courses (Education Sciences, Economic Sciences, Sport
Management and Sport Sciences, and Safety Engineering), as well as master’s, postgraduate courses and higher
education courses.

The University, unlike most of the Italian public and private universities, does not receive the usual contributions
paid by the State, including the ordinary MIUR funding (“FFO”), or by other public or private entities, aimed at
covering management and operating costs without any result-linked constraint.

The Company also pays great attention to national and international research activities, as well as to the
promotion of training of younger generations in research activities. Both within and outside of the EU,
consistently with the general principles set out in its Articles of Association, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l.
promotes the international development of education, research and studies, also and in particular through cultural
exchanges between different countries and collaboration with the most prestigious universities within the
Community area.

Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. has offices located throughout Italy, in many cases within the most
prestigious palaces and monumental town complexes, places with the highest historical and cultural profile, also
testifying to the University’s authority and the consideration it enjoys among institutions, which have recognised
its commitment, quality and high educational profile, and therefore allowed the use of their premises.

In recent years, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. has achieved ever-increasing positive results by focusing on
innovative projects, on the quality of its research, training processes and services. The University aims to play a
driving role in cultural and economic development at the local, national and international level. For this reason, it
has deemed it appropriate, as better described below, to change its legal form into one more suitable for a larger
entity, also in accordance with the new and broader objectives that the entire education sector must focus on,
following the profound social and economic transformations which, inevitably, have also had strong
repercussions on education and training.

During the fiscal year, the activity was carried out in a regular basis; there were no events that significantly
changed the management performance and which made it necessary to resort to the exceptions referred to in art.
2423, paragraph 5, of the Italian Civil Code.

**b. Significant events that occurred during the year**

During the 2019 fiscal year, the process of converting the University into a “joint stock company”, undertaken
during the 2018 fiscal year, was completed. The process was definitively concluded with the registration in the
Register of Companies of Naples, on June 25, 2019, of the conversion resolution adopted by the BoD on
November 19, 2018, as a result of which the conversion became immediately effective.

From a legal point of view, the conversion transaction implemented by the University falls within the so-called
‘progressive heterogeneous conversions’ governed by art. 2500-octies of the Italian Civil Code; the main effect
of this operation was the University’s move from a non-commercial entity to a joint stock company.

In February 2019, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. established Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l. (jointly with the
subsidiary Universitas Mercatorum, which holds a 10% stake in the share capital of the same), a consortium
company with the aim of coordinating, carrying out and supporting the procedures and deeds relating to the
implementation, on behalf of the two consortium members (Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. and Universitas

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

Mercatorum), of their respective management programmes. In particular, the company favours coordination
between the shareholders with reference to the concession contract for the management and use of the property
‘Colonia Montana Principe di Napoli as a Centre for Higher Education and Postgraduate Studies in the
gastronomy and tourism sectors’, stipulated with the Municipality of Agerola in execution of the award of the
open tender procedure announced by means of GC resolution no. 105 of September 14, 2018 and with
subsequent determination of the LLPP (Public Works) and Environment Sector of the aforementioned
Municipality no. 140 of September 19, 2018. The facility was temporarily closed due to the Covid outbreak and,
at the date of preparation of this document, new regulatory provisions are pending regarding the timing of
reopening.

In addition, in September and October 2019, a corporate reorganisation was carried out functional to the entry
into the share capital of the Parent Company of the new financial partner, described below, concerning, in
summary:

 - the transfer of the business unit, on October 25, 2019, from Multiversity S.p.A., the former Parent
Company, to Multiversity S.r.l., a newly established company and current Parent Company, including the
equity investment held in Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. (now direct parent company of Università
Telematica S.r.l.). As a result of this extraordinary transaction, Multiversity S.r.l. assumed indirect control
of Università Telematica S.r.l. through Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A.;

 - the sale by the University to Multiversity S.p.A. of some controlling equity investments considered no
longer strategic and outside the reference corporate perimeter of the new shareholder;

 - the entry into the share capital of the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. of the new financial partner
Paganini Investments Sàrl.

For an analytical description of the divestments of the controlling equity investments made by the University in
implementation of the aforementioned reorganisation, as well as the economic and financial impacts of the
aforementioned transactions, please refer to the section relating to “Equity investments in subsidiaries” later in
this document.

In November 2019, Paganini Investment Sàrl, indirectly controlled by the private equity funds assisted by CVC
Capital Partners, acquired 50% of the share capital of the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l..

**c. The conversion of Università Telematica Pegaso and budgetary obligations**

With regard to the accounting and budgetary obligations dictated for the operations of progressive heterogeneous
conversion, it should be noted that the Italian Civil Code and the national accounting standards do not impose
specific requirements, given that the legal form of the entity is changed with the aforementioned operation but
the continuity in pre-existing legal relationships remains unchanged.

Also taking into account the indications from operating practices, it was considered appropriate to draw up a
balance sheet on the effective date of the conversion (June 25, 2019), in order to ascertain the value of the
balance sheet components on the same date and the shareholders’ equity of the changing body.

From a tax point of view, given the provisions of art. 171 of the TUIR, applicable to heterogeneous conversion
operations (progressive and regressive) and to the practice documents published by the Revenue Agency
(Resolution no. 102/2009), there is the need to carry out an extraordinary survey of the income realised on the
date the conversion is considered to be completed, in consideration of the different quantification and
qualification regime of the tax base applicable to the pre- (non-commercial) and post-conversion (commercial,
and consequent classification in the business income category).

Therefore, considering the tax provisions as well as the tax operating practices referred to above, the following
were prepared:

With regard to the accounting and budgetary obligations dictated for the operations of progressive heterogeneous
conversion, it should be noted that the Italian Civil Code and the national accounting standards do not impose
specific requirements, given that the legal form of the entity is changed with the aforementioned operation but
the continuity in pre-existing legal relationships remains unchanged.

From a tax point of view, given the provisions of art. 171 of the TUIR, applicable to heterogeneous conversion
operations (progressive and regressive) and to the practice documents published by the Revenue Agency
(Resolution no. 102/2009), there is the need to carry out an extraordinary survey of the income realised on the
date the conversion is considered to be completed, in consideration of the different quantification and
qualification regime of the tax base applicable to the pre- (non-commercial) and post-conversion (commercial,
and consequent classification in the business income category).

Therefore, considering the tax provisions as well as the tax operating practices referred to above, the following
were prepared:

 - the balance sheet and the income statement relating to the period between the beginning of the fiscal year
and the day prior to the effective date of the conversion (January 1st 2019 to June 24, 2019), on the basis of
which the result for the portion of the fiscal year and the shareholders’ equity of the entity was determined,
converting on the conversion date the ordinary balance sheet for the year as at December 31, 2019 at the end
of the normal administrative period, referred to in this document and including the determination of the
entire fiscal year (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019);

 - the income statement for the period from June 25, 2019 to December 31, 2019, necessary for the
quantification of corporate income taxes in the post-conversion period.

Finally, it should be noted that Università Telematica Pegaso has drawn up the financial statements for the year
preceding the one in which the conversion into a joint stock company took place, in compliance with the
accounting standards and the schedules attached to the Interministerial Decree no. 19 of January 14, 2014
(hereinafter also referred to as “ID” for convenience) which definitively implemented Italian Legislative Decree
no. 18 of January 27, 2012, and which introduced, for all universities, the obligation to keep an economic and
financial accounting system and the preparation of individual universities’ annual financial statements.

On this point, it is recalled that, as established by article 1, paragraph 3, of the aforementioned ID, in drawing up
the financial statements the University has also always taken into account, for all that is not expressly sanctioned
by the decree itself, the provisions of the Italian Civil Code (Article 2423 and following) and the national
accounting standards issued by the Italian Accounting Organisation (OIC) and adapted by the latter to the new
provisions of Italian Legislative Decree no. 139/2015 approved in accordance with EU directive 34/13, in
addition to the indications contained in the technical-operational manual issued by the Commission for the
economic and financial accounting of Universities envisaged by art. 9 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 18 of
January 27, 2012 and in accordance with the provisions of art. 8 of the ID.

It is further highlighted that the University, on the basis of the indications provided by the MIUR in the
communication of June 19, 2019 concerning the authorisation to convert the company, will transmit to the
Ministry the accounting documents required by art. 8, paragraph 2, of Italian Legislative Decree no. 18 of
January 27, 2012, for non-state universities, as well as the certifications of the financial statements in accordance
with the provisions laid down for limited liability companies.

Finally, it should be noted that the application of the accounting standards and budget assumptions established by
art. 2 of the aforementioned ID did not result in different book values for the previous year compared to those
obtained with the application of the principles established by art. 2423/bis of the Italian Civil Code, with the
consequence that, for the purposes of comparability of the items in these financial statements with those of the
previous year, the items were exclusively reclassified according to the formats of the Balance Sheet, Income
Statement, Cash Flow Statement and Explanatory Note provided for by the Italian Civil Code

**2. Basis of presentation**

In accordance with the provisions of art. 2423-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the following standards were adopted
in the preparation of the Financial Statements:

 - the valuation of the individual items was made based on principles of prudence and with a going concern
view, as well as by taking into account the economic function of the asset or liability element considered;

F-134


-----

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

 - only the profits actually realised during the year have been included;

 - the income and expenses for the year have been included, regardless of their numerical manifestation;

 - the risks and losses pertaining to the year were taken into account, even if they became known after its
closure;

 - the heterogeneous elements included in the various items of the financial statements were assessed
separately;

 - the valuation criteria adopted were the same as those of the previous year.

The Balance Sheet and the Income Statement are drawn up in Euro units, rounding the amounts up or down, in
accordance to the provision of the EU Regulation; also in the explanatory notes, amounts are expressed in Euro
units as they guarantee a better document clarity.

For assets and liabilities elements that fall under more than one item of the financial statements, the explanatory
notes also note whether they pertain to items other than those in which they are recorded, if this is necessary for
the purposes of understanding the financial statements.

Where applicable, the principles and recommendations enacted by the professional bodies responsible for
accounting were also observed, always in order to give a true and fair view of the equity, financial and economic
situation.

There have been no exceptional cases, incompatible with the general clause of true and correct representation,
pursuant to art. 2423, fifth paragraph of the Italian Civil Code, which imposed an exception to the provisions of
the Law for the preparation of the Financial Statements.

In accordance with the provisions of art. 2423-bis, point 6, of the Italian Civil Code, the valuation criteria were
not changed from one year to another and there were no exceptional cases such as to justify an exception to this
principle, pursuant to paragraph 2 of the same article.

In compliance with accounting standard OIC 29, no corrections have been made in the Financial Statements for
significant errors committed in previous years.

**2.1 Comparability and adaptation**

These financial statements are the first drawn up after the conversion of the University into a joint stock
company, as well as according to the Balance Sheet and Income Statement formats provided for by art. 2424 and
following of the Italian Civil Code; consequently, all the items in the balance sheet and income statement of the
previous year have been adapted and made comparable with those of the current year. In this regard, it should be
noted that, starting from the 2018 fiscal year, the University has brought forward the duration of the academic
year previously scheduled for the period October 1 to September 30. Consequently, the allocation of accrued
revenues and deferred income for the 2018 fiscal year considers the new period of duration of the academic year.

In accordance with art. 2423/ter of the Italian Civil Code, therefore, the corresponding amount of the previous
year is indicated for each item of the balance sheet and income statement. On this point, please refer to the
further explanation in the previous paragraph entitled “The conversion of Università Telematica Pegaso and
budgetary obligations”

**2.2 Valuation criteria applied**

This section presents, in detail, the criteria that contributed to the calculation of the individual items in the
financial statements.

**Assets**

**Non current assets**

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recorded at purchase cost including accessory and financial charges, and direct and indirect
costs incurred before the use of the asset, for the portion reasonably attributable to them.

F-135


-----

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

The cost of intangible assets, whose use is limited over time, is systematically amortised in each fiscal year
according to their residual possible use. In particular, amortisation rates are applied that reflect the estimated
useful life of the assets.

The amortization rates used are summarised in the following table:

**Category** **Rate**

Start-up and expansion costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20%
Industrial patent and intellectual property rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20%
Concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20%
Other intangible assets:
_—Improvements on third party assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ _Based on the lease agreement or 20%_
_—Usufruct on real estate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ _8.33%_

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment, whose use is limited in time, are recognised in the financial statements at
purchase cost, including directly attributable accessory charges, and have been depreciated on a straight-line
basis, based on the useful life of the assets and taking into account their residual possibility of use, physical wear,
technological evolution and obsolescence.

Maintenance costs of an ordinary nature have been charged in full to the income statement, while those of an
incremental nature (expansion, modernisation or improvement), connected to an increase in the production
capacity or safety of the asset or an extension of its useful life, are attributed to the assets to which they refer and
are depreciated in relation to the residual possibility of use of the same.

Depreciation rates used are summarised in the following table:

**Category** **Rate**

Plants and equipment:
_—Generic plants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ _15%_

Other tangible assets:
_—Furniture and furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ _15%_
_—Other tangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ _25%_

**Write-downs for impairment of intangible assets**

At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether there are indicators to suggest that an asset may have
suffered an impairment. If such an indicator is present, the Company estimates the recoverable value of the asset
and writes it down only if this is lower than the corresponding net book value. In the absence of indicators of
potential impairment, the recoverable value is not calculated.

When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the Company estimates the
recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of their fair value net of sales costs and its value in use
determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows.

An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value. Subsequently, when the
impairment of an asset, other than goodwill, no longer applies or is reduced, the book value of the asset or of the
cash-generating unit is increased to the new estimate of the recoverable value without exceeding the value that
would have been determined if no impairment had been detected.

**Financial assets**

**Equity investments**

Equity investments are recorded among financial assets if they are destined for a lasting permanence in the
company’s portfolio, otherwise they are recognised under current assets. Controlling equity investments are

F-136


-----

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

entered at purchase cost including accessory charges. The original book value of the equity investment is
modified in the periods following the acquisition to consider the portions pertaining to profits and losses and
other changes in the shareholders’ equity of the investee, thus applying the equity method. The book value of the
equity investment is written down in the presence of permanent losses in value, determined by comparing the
book value of the equity investment with its recoverable value, calculated on the basis of the future benefits that
are expected to flow into the investor’s economy. This occurs when the loss in value is caused by factors internal
or external to the Company, or to a combination of them, and it is not expected that the reasons that caused it can
be eliminated in a short period of time. All evaluations are carried out separately for each individual equity
investment.

**Receivables**

Receivables originating from revenues for the sale of goods or the provision of services are recognised under
current assets on the basis of the accrual principle when the conditions for the recognition of the related revenues
are met.

Receivables originating for different reasons are recognised if there is a ‘title’ to the receivable and therefore
when they actually represent an obligation by third parties towards the company; if of a financial nature, they are
classified under financial assets, with indication of the portion due within the next fiscal year.

Receivables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, taking into account the time factor, and
within the limits of their presumed realisable value and, therefore, are shown in the balance sheet net of the
related bad debt provision deemed adequate to cover losses due to reasonably predicted bad debt.

If the transaction’s interest rate is not significantly different from the market rate, the receivable is initially
recorded at a value equal to the nominal value net of all premiums, discounts, rebates and inclusive of any costs
directly attributable to the transaction that generated the receivable. These transaction costs, any commission
income and expense and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are spread
over the duration of the loan using the effective interest criterion.

On the other hand, when the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is
significantly different from the market rate, the receivable (and the corresponding revenue in the case of
commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows plus any
transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate.

In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition
value of the receivable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as financial
income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate criterion.

In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the
present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial
income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the
transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest
income accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement
with an offsetting entry against the value of the receivable.

The value of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the amounts received, both by way of principal and
interest, as well as for any write-downs to bring the receivables to their presumed realisable value or for losses.

The Company assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and of its discount are
irrelevant when the maturity of the receivables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual
and substantive considerations in place at the time the credit is recognised, and the transaction costs and any
difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case,
discounting is omitted, the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered under
deferrals and amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the receivable to adjust the nominal interest
income.

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents, revenue stamps and cash balances resulting from the accounts held by the Company
with credit institutions are allocated to this item, all expressed at their nominal value, specifically converted into
national currency in the case of accounts in foreign currencies.

**Shareholders’ equity**

This item includes all the transactions of a financial nature carried out between the Company and subjects who
exercise their rights and duties as shareholders. The share capital increase is recognised in the accounts only after
the transaction has been entered in the companies’ register, as governed by art. 2444, paragraph 2, of the Italian
Civil Code. In this case, the corresponding amount is recognised in a specific item of shareholders’ equity (other
than the item ‘Share capital’), which includes the amounts of share capital subscribed by the shareholders, which
will be subsequently reclassified when the conditions described above are met.

**Provisions for risks and charges**

They are set aside to cover losses or debts of certain or probable existence, whose amount or date of occurrence
could not be determined at the end of the year. In the valuation of these provisions, the general criteria of
prudence and accrual were respected and no provision was made for generic risks without economic justification.

Potential liabilities are recognised in the financial statements and recorded in the provisions when their
manifestation is considered probable and when the amount of the related charge can be reasonably estimated.

Any risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible or for which no objective forecast of the
resulting charge is possible are indicated in the Explanatory Notes without making allocations to provisions for
risks and charges.

Risks whose probability of occurrence appears remote are not considered.

**Employee termination indemnity**

The provision for employee termination indemnityis set aside to cover the entire liability accrued towards
employees, in compliance with current legislation and collective employment and supplementary company
agreements. This liability is subject to revaluation pursuant to art. 2120 of the Italian Civil Code.

The employee termination indemnityrecognised in the financial statements is given by the total of the individual
indemnities accrued by employees, including revaluations, net of the advances paid, and taking into account the
effects of the reform introduced by Law no. 296 (2007 Finance Law) of 27 December 2006, on the allocation of
employee termination indemnity (to the INPS treasury fund or other selected entities).

As a result of this reform, the employee severance indemnities accrued up to December 31, 2006 remain in the
company and contribute to forming the provision for employee termination indemnity allocated in the financial
statements.

Starting from January 1st 2007, the employee severance indemnities accrued during the year are charged to the
income statement and are reflected, for the part still to be paid to th e INPS Treasury Fund or other funds, under
current payables in item D14.

**Payables**

Payables originating from acquisitions of assets are recognised in the balance sheet when significant risks,
charges and benefits associated with their ownership have been substantially transferred. Payables relating to
services are recognised when the services have been rendered, that is, the service has been performed.

Financial payables arising for financing transactions and payables arising for reasons other than the acquisition of
goods and services are recognised when the company has an obligation towards the counterparty, identified on
the basis of legal and contractual regulations.

F-138


-----

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

The advances received from customers for the supply of services not yet carried out are included in the item
advances.

Payables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, considering the time factor.

If the transaction’s interest rate is not significantly different from the market rate, the payable is initially
recognised at a value equal to the nominal value, net of all transaction costs and all premiums, discounts and
rebates deriving directly from the transaction that generated the payable. These transaction costs, such as
ancillary expenses for obtaining loans, any commission income and expenses and any difference between the
initial value and nominal value at maturity, are spread over the duration of the payable using the effective interest
criterion.

On the other hand, when the transaction’s interest rate inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly
different from the market rate, the payable (and the corresponding cost in the case of commercial transactions) is
initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows, taking into account any transaction
costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate.

In the case of payables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value
of the payable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as a financial charge
over the duration of the payable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial payables, the
difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows,
determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income
statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract suggests the
attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest expense accruing on the transaction
is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with an offsetting entry against the
value of the payable.

The value of the payables is subsequently reduced by the amounts paid, both in terms of the principal and of
interest.

The Company assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and the discount are
irrelevant when the due date of payables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and
substantial considerations in place when the payable is recognised, and the costs transaction and any difference
between initial value and nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting is
omitted and the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered under deferrals and
amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the payable to adjust the nominal interest expense.

**Payables to group companies**

Items D9, D10 and D11 respectively include payables to subsidiaries, associates and parent companies, as
defined pursuant to art. 2359 of the Italian Civil Code. These payables are indicated separately in the balance
sheet.

Item D11 also includes payables to parent companies that indirectly control the Company, through their
intermediate subsidiaries.

Payables to companies subject to common control (‘sister companies’), other than subsidiaries, associates or
parent companies, are recognised in item D11-bis.

**Revenue**

Revenues from the provision of services are recognised on the date on which the services are completed or, for
those dependent on contracts with periodic payments, on the date of accrual of the payments.

Sales revenues are recognised net of returns, discounts, allowances and bonuses, as well as taxes directly
connected with the sale, the provision of services and adjustments to revenues for the year are directly deducted
from the item revenues.

F-139


-----

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

The item “other revenues and income” includes positive non-financial income components deriving entirely from
ancillary management.

It should be noted that the income from teaching is accounted for in the year taking into account the principle of
correlation of the revenues deriving from the enrolment of students in the academic year and the costs associated
with the provision in the year of competence of the courses to students enrolled in the same academic year, using
the deferred income method. In recording the revenue, account is taken of the peculiarity of the online university
which does not allow the use of the service, and consequently of the costs incurred, except for regularly enrolled
students.

**Costs**

Purchase costs are recognised on an accruals basis. The costs for raw and ancillary materials, consumables and
goods include accessory purchase costs (transport, insurance, loading and unloading, etc.) if included by the
supplier in the purchase price of the same, otherwise they are recognised separately under costs for services
according to their nature.

Not only costs of a certain amount, but also those not yet documented for which the transfer of ownership has
already taken place or the service has already been received, are recognised under costs.

**Financial income and expenses**

They include all the positive and negative components of the economic result for the year connected with the
company’s financial asset and are recognised on an accrual basis.

**Income taxes—Current, Prepaid and Deferred**

Current income taxes are allocated according to the accrual principle on the basis of the tax charges resulting
from the application of the tax legislation in force and are entered under tax payables net of advances.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the temporary differences between the value attributed to the
assets and liabilities according to statutory criteria and the value attributed to the same assets and liabilities for
tax purposes.

Deferred taxes are entered under the ‘Deferred tax reserve’ recorded under liabilities among the provisions for
risks and charges, while prepaid taxes are recorded under receivables from others under current assets.

Assets deriving from prepaid taxes are not recognised, in compliance with the principle of prudence, if there is no
reasonable certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be
reversed, of a taxable income higher than the amount of the differences to be cancelled. Liabilities for deferred
taxes are recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will be reversed in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year in which
the tax assets will be realised or the tax liability will be extinguished, based on the tax legislation established by
provisions in force at the reference date of the financial statements.

**Accruals and deferrals**

The portions of costs and income common to two or more fiscal years are recorded under these items, according
to the criterion of economic and temporal competence. Based on this criterion, accruals or deferrals are
recognised when the following conditions are met:

 - the contract begins in one fiscal year and ends in a subsequent one;

 - the consideration for the services is contractually due in advance or in arrears with respect to services
common to two or more consecutive years;

 - the amount of accruals and deferrals varies with the passage of time.

Income and charges whose accrual has matured in full in the fiscal year to which the financial statements refer or
in subsequent ones are not included under accruals and deferrals.

F-140

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

**Conversion criteria for foreign currency items**

In compliance with art. 2426, paragraph 1, no. 8-bis of the Italian Civil Code, monetary assets and liabilities in
currencies other than the functional currency in which the financial statements are presented (‘accounting
currency’), are recognised at the spot exchange rate on the closing date of the exercise after initial recognition.
The consequent gains or losses on foreign exchange are recognised in the income statement under item C17-bis)
‘profits and losses on foreign exchange’ and any net profit, which contributes to the calculation of the operating
profit, is set aside in a specific non-distributable reserve until realisation.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the accounting currency are recognised at the
exchange rate in effect at the time of their purchase. If the exchange rate in force at the closing date of the fiscal
year is significantly different from that at the acquisition date, the exchange rate variation is one of the elements
taken into consideration in the valuation process to determine the book value of individual non-monetary assets
in the financial statements. In this case, therefore, any exchange differences (positive or negative) contribute to
the determination of the recoverable value.

**Notes to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019**

The share capital and the legal reserve increased, respectively, by € 1,000,000 and € 200,000 following the legal
effect of the conversion of the University into a joint stock company on June 25, 2019, which occurred with the
registration in the Naples Companies’ Register of the resolution of the Board of Directors of November 18, 2019
which led to a reclassification of the other reserves.

As a result of the conversion, the share capital was entirely assigned free of charge to Università Telematica
Pegaso S.p.A., the University’s promoter and supporter, in compliance with the aforementioned resolution.

The item Other reserves includes the Reserve for operating surpluses before the conversion; it was formed as a
result of the operating surpluses of the non-commercial entity up to December 31, 2018. Compared to the
previous year, the item decreased by € 1,200,000, due to the recognition of the share capital and of the legal
reserve at the date of the conversion and it increased due to the carry-forward of the 2018 result.

The profit of the fiscal year as at December 31, 2019 of € 6,203,682 is made up as follows: i) € 3,757,841
relating to the portion from January 1, 2019 to June 24, 2019 (pre-conversion period); ii) € 2,445,841 relating to
the portion from June 25, 2019 to December 31, 2019 (post-conversion period).

trusted advisors, the Group is promptly responding to the requests and questions raised.

On the basis of the current state of the checks and in the absence of findings received to date, no areas of possible

**54. Information on significant events occurring after the close of the fiscal year**

With the Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of March 1st 2020 “Further implementing
provisions of decree-law no. 6 of February 23, 2020’, containing urgent measures regarding the containment and
management of the epidemiological emergency from COVID-19, published in OJ Special Series no. 52 of
March 1st 2020, the temporary closure of Universities and Institutions of Higher Artistic, Musical and Dancing
Education (AFAM) was arranged, among other things, without prejudice to the possibility of carrying out
distance learning activities. With subsequent acts and implementing provisions, starting from March 2020,
universities and AFAM institutions were entitled, in the exercise of their autonomy, to prioritise alternative
remote methods, progress examinations, including graduation sessions, which can be carried out using remote
access methods. These provisions, if reasonably confirmed also following the resolution of the COVID outbreak,
constitute a change of epic proportions in the processes on which traditional teaching is based, contributing in a
dramatic manner to the promotion of a modern and indeed more democratic and global university education,
functional to the creation of a ‘Global University’ with the same technology, philosophy, values and methods
able to make students feel at home in every university in the various countries of the world and allow the creation
of multiple learning, interdisciplinary and multicultural channels.

The University immediately activated all the necessary measures to allow all employees to work remotely in
order to guarantee their full safety and at the same time the operation of all activities.

Further assessments are carried out through continuous monitoring of the regulatory context and of all the
provisions of the relevant bodies in order to guarantee the full safety of workers.

measures in the field of health, support for work and the economy, as well as social policies related to the
epidemiological emergency from COVID-19’, exemption from payment of the IRAP balance relating to 2019,
was given to companies with total revenue not exceeding € 250,000,000. The Company, therefore, falling into
the above category, when drafting the UNICO2020 form, relating to the tax year 2019, will recognise a
contingent asset equal to the amount of the payable recorded in the financial statements as at December 31, 2019,
relating to the IRAP tax not due.

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

##### Independent auditor’s report (Translation from the original Italian text)

To the Directors of
Università Telematica Pegaso

**Report on the Audit of the University Financial Statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the university financial statements of Università Telematica Pegaso (the “University”), which
comprise the balance sheet as at December 31, 2018, the income statement and statement of cash flows for the
year then ended, and explanatory notes.

In our opinion, the university financial statements of Università Telematica Pegaso as at December 31, 2018 has
been prepared, in all significant aspects, in accordance with the principles and criteria described in paragraph
“Section 1—Valuation criteria applied to the financial statements”.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the University
_Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the University in accordance with the_
regulations and standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of university financial statements
under Italian Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

**Other matters**

This report is not issued pursuant to the law, given that the correspondence of the university financial statements
to the accounting results as well as the assessments and opinion on administrative-accounting regularity, pursuant
to art. 5 of Legislative Decree No. 18 of January 27, 2012, were carried out, in the financial year ended
December 31, 2018, by another auditor.

**Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the University Financial Statements**

The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the university financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance with the Italian regulations governing financial statements, and, within the terms provided by
the law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Directors are responsible for assessing the University’s ability to continue as a going concern and, when
preparing the university financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, and for
appropriate disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the university financial statements on a going concern basis
unless they either intend to liquidate the University or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.

The board of auditors (“Collegio dei Revisori dei Conti”) is responsible, within the terms provided by the law,
for overseeing the University’s financial reporting process and the correspondence of the single university
financial statements with the accounting results.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the University Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the university financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these university financial statements.

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have exercised
professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:

 - we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the university financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

 - we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the University’s internal control;

 - we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors;

 - we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the University’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this matter in
forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the University to cease to continue as a
going concern;

we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the university financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the university financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by
ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

**Notes to the Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018**

**1. Introduction**

In the preparation of these financial statements as at December 31, 2018, we have complied with the accounting
standards and the schedules attached to Interministerial Decree No. 19 of 14 January 2014 (hereinafter also
referred to as “ID” for convenience) which definitively implemented Italian Legislative Decree No. 18 of
January 27, 2012, approved in the framework of amendments provided by the “Gelmini” reform (Law No. 240 of
30 December 2012) and which introduced, for all universities, the obligation to keep an economic and financial
accounting system and the preparation of individual single financial statements for the year.

As established by article 1, paragraph 3, of the aforementioned ID, in drawing up this document, we have also
taken into account, for all that is not expressly sanctioned by the decree itself, the provisions of the Italian Civil
Code (Article 2423 and following) and the national accounting standards issued by the Italian Accounting
Organisation (OIC) and adapted by the latter to the new provisions of Italian Legislative Decree No. 139/2015
approved in accordance with EU directive 34/13. In adoption of the ID, the financial statements presented below
contain some items no longer envisaged by the Balance Sheet and Income Statement formats envisaged by Art.
2424 and 2425 of the Italian Civil Code (Memorandum Accounts in the Balance Sheet, Extraordinary
Management in the Income Statement) and the Cash Flow Statement defined by OIC 10, following the changes
introduced by the Italian Legislative Decree No. 139/2015.

Furthermore, with the clarifications set out below, the indications contained in the technical-operational manual
issued with a new update on July 26, 2017 (Protocol No. 0001841), by the Commission for the economic and
financial accounting of Universities provided for by the Art. 9 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 18 of January 27,
2012 and in accordance with the provisions of Art. 8 of the ID.

The document that is submitted for your examination corresponds to the results of the accounting records
regularly kept by the University and is made up of the following documents:

 - Balance Sheet;

 - Income Statement;

 - Cash Flow Statement;

 - Explanatory Notes.

It should be noted that:

 - the balance sheet, the income statement and the cash flow statement are prepared in Euro units. The
transition from account balances, expressed in Euro cents, to the financial statements balances, expressed in
Euro units, took place by rounding up or down. The balancing of the financial statements was ensured by
summarising the differentials of the balance sheet in a “Reserve for rounding into Euro units”, recorded
under item “Other reserves” and those of the income statement, alternatively, in “Extraordinary income” or
“Extraordinary expenses”;

 - the data in the explanatory notes are expressed in Euro units as they guarantee a better intelligibility of the
document.

It should be noted that, starting from the 2018 fiscal year, with a just resolution of the Board of Directors of
12 June 2018, adopted in line with the University mission and with the University’s statutory provisions, the
University brought forward the duration of the academic year previously scheduled for the period from October 1
to September 30 to the period August 1st to July 31.

Consequently, the allocation of accrued revenues and deferred income for the year ended December 31, 2018
takes into account the new period of duration of the academic year and this aspect must be considered when
comparing the income from teaching in 2018 with those of previous year. Specifically, teaching income was
recognised for a period of approximately nine months for the 2017-2018 academic year, in line with the 20162017 academic year for the 2017 fiscal year, and five months of income for the academic year 2018-2019,
compared to three months of the academic year 2017-2018 recognised in 2017.

It is emphasised that the change in duration of the Academic Year, dictated exclusively by educational reasons,
has allowed working students to extend the time span of study opportunities and will continue to do so in future.

**Notes to the Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018**

**2. Drafting principles**

The valuation criteria adopted for the preparation of the Financial Statements as at December 31, 2018 observe
the principle of prudence in the perspective of the continuation of the university’s activities and take into account
the economic function of the asset or liability element considered.

The criteria and postulates adopted comply with those defined by Art. 2 of ID 19/2014.

The main criteria defined in accordance with Art. 4 of the ID 19/2014 are listed below. For further details, please
refer to the comments to the individual item groups of the budget items.

The following have been respected: the general and postulated accounting standards (Art. 2 of ID 19/2014), the
principles of valuation of items (Art. 4 of ID 19/2014) and, where applicable, the general clause for the
preparation of financial statements, the principles for drafting and the evaluation criteria established by law.

It should be noted that the income from teaching is accounted for in the year taking into account the principle of
correlation of the revenues deriving from the enrolment of students in the academic year and the costs associated
with the provision in the year of competence of the courses to students enrolled in the same academic year, using
the deferred income method. In recording the revenue, account is taken of the peculiarity of the online university
which does not allow the use of the service, and consequently of the costs incurred, except for regularly enrolled
students.

**Assets**

**Non current assets**

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are represented by multi-year assets or costs characterised by their immaterial and, therefore,
intangible nature, which manifest their economic benefits over a period of several years.

Intangible assets are recorded at purchase cost including accessory and financial charges, and direct and indirect
costs incurred before the use of the asset, for the portion reasonably attributable to them.

The cost of intangible assets, whose use is limited over time, is systematically amortised in each fiscal year
according to the residual possible use. In particular, amortisation rates are applied that reflect the estimated
economically useful life of the assets.

Amortisation rates used are summarised in the following table:

**Category** **Rate**

Start-up, expansion and development costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20%
Industrial patent rights and intellectual property rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20%
Concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20%
Other intangible assets:

_- Improvements on third party assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ _Based on the lease agreement or 20%_

_- Usufruct on real estate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ _8.33%_

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment, whose use is limited in time, are recognised in the financial statements at
purchase cost, including directly attributable accessory charges, and have been depreciated on a straight-line
basis, based on the useful life of the assets and taking into account their residual possibility of use, physical wear,
technological evolution and obsolescence.

Maintenance costs of an ordinary nature have been charged in full to the income statement, while those of an
incremental nature (expansion, modernisation or improvement), connected to an increase in the production
capacity or safety of the asset or an extension of its useful life, are attributed to the assets to which they refer and
are depreciated in relation to the residual possibility of use of the same.

Fixed assets in progress and advances include the sums paid as advance on assets not yet operational at the end of
the fiscal year or for acquisitions of individual assets constituting components still in formation.

**Write-downs for impairment of tangible and intangible assets**

At each balance sheet date, the existence of any indicator suggesting that a fixed asset may have suffered
impairment is assessed. If such an indicator is present, the recoverable value of the asset is estimated, writing it
down only if this is lower than the corresponding net book value. In the absence of indicators of potential
impairment, the recoverable value is not determined.

When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the recoverable value of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated.

The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and its value in use determined
as the present value of estimated future cash flows.

An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value. When, subsequently, an
impairment on an asset, other than goodwill, ceases to exist or is reduced, the book value of the asset or the cashgenerating unit is increased up to the new estimate of the recoverable value without exceeding the value that
would have been determined if no impairment had been detected.

**Financial assets**

Equity investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are recorded under financial fixed assets, valued on
the basis of the “equity method” according to the indications of Ministerial Decree No. 19 of January 14, 2014.

The item includes the University’s equity investments other than those in subsidiaries and associates, intended
for long-term investment, and are recorded at the acquisition cost inclusive of ancillary charges.

Investments in securities and financial instruments are recognised at cost determined on the basis of the reports
provided by the custodian bank for asset management.

**Receivables**

Receivables from students for enrolment in degree courses in a given academic year are entirely recognised on
the date of first enrolment or at the beginning of each academic year for students already enrolled in previous
academic years, and refer to payments due from students to attend university courses. Receivables for enrolment
in postgraduate courses (masters, training and advanced training courses) are entirely recognised on the date of
enrolment of the student.

Receivables are shown at their presumed realisable value net of a bad debt provision which is calculated taking
into account both the losses resulting from certain elements and information currently available, as well as taking
into account the risks of non-collection, prudentially estimated considering the age of receivables and having
regard to past experience.

Where the receivables are overdue by over 12 months, discounting is carried out in the event of a significant
difference between the effective interest rate and the market rate. For this type of receivable, the receivable (and

**Notes to the Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018**

the corresponding revenue in the case of commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the
present value of future cash flows plus any transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market
rate. In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial
recognition value thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in
revenues, generating a financial income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate
criterion.

In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed or collected
and the present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under
financial income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the
transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest
income or expense accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the
income statement with an offsetting entry against the value of the receivable or payable.

If the financial credit is disbursed to a subsidiary and from the available evidence it can be inferred that the
nature of the transaction is the strengthening of the subsidiary’s equity, the effect deriving from the application of
the amortised cost criterion is recognised as an increase in the value of the investment, instead of under financial
charges in the income statement.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents are shown at their nominal value.

**Accrued income and prepaid expenses**

Accruals and deferrals refer to income pertaining to the year payable in subsequent years, and to costs incurred
by the end of the year but pertaining to subsequent years. The amount of accruals and deferrals is determined by
dividing the revenue or cost, in order to attribute only the relevant portion to the current fiscal year, in
compliance with the provisions of Art. 4 of the ID.

At the end of each fiscal year, it is checked that the conditions that determined the initial recognition of the
accrual or deferred income are still met; if necessary, the relative value adjustments are made. A new valuation is
therefore made to update the balance at the end of the year. This valuation considers not only the passage of time
but also the possible recoverability of the amount recognised in the financial statements.

**Shareholders’ equity**

Shareholders’ equity consists of unencumbered reserves, deriving from the statutory results achieved as well as
of statutory reserves.

**Provisions for risks and charges**

They are set aside to cover losses or debts of certain or probable existence, whose amount or date of occurrence
could not be determined at the end of the year.

In the valuation of these provisions, the general criteria of prudence and accrual were respected and no provision
was made for generic risk provisions without economic justification.

Potential liabilities are recognised in the financial statements and recorded in the provisions when their
manifestation is considered probable and when the amount of the related charge can be reasonably estimated.

Any risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible or for which no objective forecast of the
resulting charge is possible are indicated in the Explanatory Notes without accruing provisions for risks and
charges.

Risks whose probability of occurrence appears remote are not taken into account.

**Employee termination indemnity**

Employee termination indemnities represent the actual liability accrued towards employees, in compliance with
current legislation and collective labour agreements. This liability is subject to revaluation based on the

F-180

**Notes to the Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018**

application of indices established by current legislation, and the amount is recognised gross of the advance
payment required by Art. 3 of Law No. 662/96 and subsequent amendments.

The accrual does not include indemnities accrued starting from January 1st, 2007, intended for supplementary
pension schemes pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005.

**Payables**

Pursuant to Art. 2423, paragraph 4 of the Italian Civil Code, payables were recognised at nominal value and not
according to the amortised cost criterion pursuant to Art. 2426, paragraph 1, number 8 of the Italian Civil Code,
since the effects of the application of this criterion were irrelevant, given the maturity of the payables within 12
months.

The subdivision of amounts due within and beyond the fiscal year is carried out with reference to the contractual
or legal maturity, also taking into account facts and events that may determine a modification of the original
maturity.

Payables originating from acquisitions of assets are recognised when the risks, charges and benefits are
transferred; those relating to services are recognised at the time the service is performed; financial and other
types of payables, at the moment in which the obligation towards the counterpart arises.

Payables to the tax authorities, recorded under the item “Other payables”, include liabilities for certain and
determined taxes, as well as withholdings made as a substitute, and not yet paid at the balance sheet date, and,
where offsetting is allowed, they are recorded net of advances, withholding taxes and tax credits.

**Accrued liabilities and deferred income and investment contributions**

Accrued liabilities and deferred income refer to costs pertaining to the year payable in subsequent years and to
income received by the end of the year but pertaining to subsequent years. The amount of accruals and deferrals
is determined by dividing the revenue or cost, in order to attribute only the relevant portion to the current fiscal
year, in compliance with the provisions of Art. 4 of the ID.

At the end of each fiscal year, it is checked that the conditions that determined the initial recognition of the
accrual or deferred income are still met; if necessary, the necessary value adjustments are made. A new valuation
is therefore made to update the balance at the end of the year.

**Operating income**

Income from teaching is recorded based on the principle of economic competence, deferring the portion not
pertaining to the year. It should be noted that the revenues recorded are gross of costs incurred for student
support and for the right to education, which are shown, respectively, in items B IX 1 and B IX 2.

The breakdown by geographical area is not presented as almost all of them are generated in Italy.

**Operating costs**

Costs and charges are recorded in the financial statements in compliance with the criteria of prudence, of
competence, net of returns, discounts, allowances and bonuses.

With reference to the information prescribed by numbers 8, 11 and 18 of paragraph 1 of Art. 2427 of the Italian
Civil Code, it is specified that financial charges relating to values recorded in the balance sheet are capitalised
during the year, where permitted.

The breakdown by geographical area is not presented as almost all of the operating costs are incurred in Italy.

**Financial income and expenses**

Financial income and expenses include all the positive and negative components of the economic result for the
year connected with the university’s financial activities and are recognised on an accrual basis.

**Notes to the Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018**

**Memorandum accounts**

It should be noted that the risks relating to guarantees granted, personal or real, for the debts of others have been
indicated in the memorandum accounts for an amount equal to the amount of the guarantee given.

**Use of estimates**

The preparation of the financial statements requires Directors to make estimates and assumptions that have an
effect on the values of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements and on the information relating to
potential assets and liabilities. The preparation of these estimates involves the use of available information and
the adoption of subjective assessments, based on experience.

By their nature, the estimates and assumptions used may vary from year to year and, therefore, it cannot be
excluded that in subsequent years the current book values may differ as a result of changes in the subjective
assessments made.

The estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of each change are reflected in the
income statement in the period in which the change occurred.

**3. Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are mainly composed of software costs, restructuring costs on third party assets, as well as the
right of use on the property in Naples, at the Isola A 3 Centro Direzionale purchased in 2010.

The increase in gross receivables is due exclusively to the increase in the amounts recorded during the year as
detailed in the report on the financial statements. The accrual to the bad debt provision was made by estimating
the amounts of receivables accrued for academic years prior to 18/19 for which there is a risk of recoverability.
Due to the strengthening of the administrative and accounting structure and the improvement of the credit
recovery process started in 2018, compared to the previous year, the University decided to set aside 70% of the
credits of the last closed academic year to the Bad Debts Provision, that is the 17/18 academic year. In the
previous year, this percentage stood at 85%. The reasons for this change are based on the monitoring of the
