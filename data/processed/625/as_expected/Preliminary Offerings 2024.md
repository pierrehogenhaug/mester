Memorandum to any other person.

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer
to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale
would be unlawful. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the
Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in
that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of
each Issuer in such jurisdiction. In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering
and the Issue Date, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not
participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or
sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the U.S.
Securities Act.

This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom. The
securities may not be offered or sold other than to persons whose ordinary activities involve these persons in
acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as principal or agent) for the purposes of their
businesses or who it is reasonable to expect will acquire, hold, manage or dispose of investments (as principal or
agent) for the purposes of their businesses where the issue of the securities would otherwise constitute a
contravention of Section 19 of the FSMA by us. In addition, no person may communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21
of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in
which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us.

This Offering Memorandum has been addressed to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted electronically may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any initial purchaser, or any of their

**MIFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market:** Solely for the
purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt
securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such
debt securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to
sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors:** The securities described in the Offering
Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA (as defined above). Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore, offering or selling the securities or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The attached Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of securities in any Member
State of the EEA that is subject to the Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. The attached
Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market:** Solely for the
purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process in the United Kingdom, the target market assessment
in respect of the debt securities described in the following Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that:
(i) the target market for such debt securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook
Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients as defined in Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK
**MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional**
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**UK PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering**
Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any “retail investor” in the U.K. (as defined above). Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities described in the Offering
Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared, and
therefore, offering or selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

The attached Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in the UK
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of securities. The attached Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of
the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED APRIL 29, 2024**


**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL**


**NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**

**IN THE UNITED STATES**


**Pachelbel BidCo S.p.A.**

**€550,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2031**

**€550,000,000      % Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2031**

_________________________


Pachelbel BidCo S.p.A., a joint stock company (società per azioni) incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) (i) €550 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2031 (the “Floating Rate **Notes”) and (ii) €550 million aggregate principal amount of its       % Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2031 (the “Fixed Rate Notes” and, together with the**
Floating Rate Notes, the “Notes”) as part of the financing for the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Multiversity S.p.A., an entity incorporated under the laws of Italy (the “Target” or “Multiversity,” and together
with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Multiversity Group”).

The Issuer will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes at a rate equal to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (with 0% floor), plus (ii)   % per annum, reset quarterly. The Issuer will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes
quarterly in arrear on   ,   ,    and   of each year, commencing on  , 2024. The Floating Rate Notes will mature on   , 2031. The Issuer will pay interest on the Fixed Rate Notes at a rate equal to    % per annum,
payable semi-annually in arrear on    and    of each year, commencing on , 2025. The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on   , 2031.

At any time prior to   , 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Floating Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus the relevant “make-whole” premium as described herein. At any time prior to,     2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Floating
Rate Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set out herein plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, provided that at least
50% of the original principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes remains outstanding immediately after such redemption. At any time on or after   , 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Floating Rate Notes at
par.

At any time prior to   , 2027, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus the relevant “make-whole” premium as described herein. At any time prior to  , 2027, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Fixed Rate
Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set out herein plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, provided that at least 50%
of the original principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes remains outstanding immediately after such redemption. At any time prior to  , 2027, the Issuer may redeem, during each calendar year commencing with the Issue
Date, up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date. At any time on or after   , 2027, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Fixed Rate Notes at the redemption prices set forth herein.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the relevant series of Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is not
exceeded in connection with such event. In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes of a series upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof. See “Description of the Notes.”

In connection with any tender offers for any series of Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in
such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of such Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the
right to redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes of such series (excluding any early tender or
incentive fee) plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into an escrow account in the name of the Issuer but controlled by the Escrow Agent (as
defined herein) (the “Escrow Account”) and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes (the “Escrow Charge”). The release of the Escrowed Property (as defined herein)
will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined herein) or upon occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to
a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price of each series of Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate initial issue price of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, and
additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding the special mandatory redemption date. In the event that the consummation of the Acquisition is expected to occur on or about, and in any event, within three
business days of, the Issue Date, the gross proceeds of the Offering may be directly utilized by the Issuer to, inter alia, complete the Acquisition as described in the section “Use of Proceeds” without being subject to the
escrow arrangements described in this Offering Memorandum in which case, the escrow-related mechanics (but not the special mandatory redemption provisions) described in this Offering Memorandum shall be deemed
redundant. See “Description of the Notes —Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. On the
Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Following the Acquisition Closing Date (as defined herein), the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Target to guarantee the Notes (the “Upstream
**Guarantee”) within 120 days following the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein). Our ability to procure the Upstream Guarantee is subject to certain**
material legal and contractual limitations (including the completion of the Whitewash Procedure (as defined herein)), which may limit the value of such Guarantee or result in us not being able to provide it at all as described
under “Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Collateral, the Upstream Guarantee and any future guarantees or security of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.” In addition, following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will use commercially_
reasonable efforts to complete the Post-Closing Reorganization (as defined herein) as a result of which the Issuer will merge into the Target under a reverse merger (with the Target being the surviving entity) within 18 months
following the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The Post-Closing Reorganization is subject to certain conditions, including legal and regulatory approvals and may not be completed. See
“Risks Related to the Group’s Capital Structure— _We may be unable to complete the Post-Closing Reorganization within the anticipated timeframe, or at all.” Prior to the earlier of the implementation of the Post-Closing_
Reorganization and the Guarantee of the Notes by the Target, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Target, including the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Escrow Charge. On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer, HoldCo (as defined herein) and the Trustee will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement, (a) on or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured by the Issuer Share Pledge (as defined herein); and (b) within 10 Business Days following
the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured by the Target Share Pledge (as defined herein). Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), in the event of enforcement of the Collateral, the
holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after certain parties, including the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) and counterparties to certain hedging agreements have
been repaid in full. In addition, any future Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances and any future Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to legal and
contractual limitations. See “Risk Factors,” “Description of the Notes” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”

Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the relevant series of Notes in relation to any withholding or deduction
required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time) where the Notes are held by a person resident in a country that is not listed in the
White List (as defined below) and otherwise in the circumstances as described in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. There is
no assurance that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. The Euro MTF Market is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of 2014/65/EU on markets in financial
instruments (as amended, “MiFID II”). This Offering Memorandum constitutes a prospectus for purposes of Part IV of the Luxembourg law on prospectuses for securities dated July 16, 2019.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made pursuant to
an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the
Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended and
superseded), and includes any relevant implementing measure in each member state (“EU Member State”) of
the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer
within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the
Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized,
nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by
the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering
Memorandum.

**_Prohibition of offers to EEA retail investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in
the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has
been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes.
This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**_Professional investors and ECPs only target market_**

Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of each
manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients
only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to
our obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Hong Kong**

This Offering Memorandum has not been, and will not be, registered as a prospectus under the Companies
(Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32) of Hong Kong, nor has it been authorised by
the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong pursuant to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap.
571) of the Laws of Hong Kong (the “SFO”). Accordingly, this Offering Memorandum may not be distributed,
and the New Shares may not be offered or sold, in Hong Kong other than to “professional investors” (as defined
in the SFO and any rules made under that ordinance).

No advertisement, invitation or document relating to the Notes has been or will be issued, or has been or will be
in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue, in Hong Kong or elsewhere that is directed at, or the
contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public of Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so
under the securities laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to Notes that are or are intended to be disposed
of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to professional investors. No person allotted Notes may sell, or
offer to sell, such securities in circumstances that amount to an offer to the public in Hong Kong within six
months following the date of issue of such securities.


-----

The contents of this Offering Memorandum have not been reviewed by any Hong Kong regulatory authority.
You are advised to exercise caution in relation to the offer. If you are in doubt about any contents of this
Offering Memorandum, you should obtain independent professional advice.

**Italy**

The offering of the Notes has not been registered with Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa, the
Italian Securities Exchange Commission (“CONSOB”) pursuant to Italian securities legislation and,
accordingly, no Notes may be offered, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly, nor may copies of this Offering
Memorandum or any other offering circular, prospectus, form of application, advertisement, other offering
material or other information or document relating to the Issuer, or the Notes be issued, distributed or published
in the Republic of Italy, except:

(i) to qualified investors (investitori qualificati), as defined by Article 2, paragraph (e) of the Prospectus
Regulation and any applicable provision of Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998, as
amended (the “Italian **Financial Services Act”) and the Italian CONSOB regulations; or**

(ii) in other circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 1 of
the Prospectus Regulation, Article 34-ter of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999, as
amended from time to time, and any other applicable Italian laws and regulations.

Any offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or distribution of copies of this Offering Memorandum or any other
document relating to the Notes in Italy under (i) or (ii) above must:

(a) be made by an investment firm, bank or financial intermediary permitted to conduct such activities in
the Republic of Italy in accordance with the Italian Financial Services Act, CONSOB Regulation No.
20307 of February 15, 2018, as amended and Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, as
amended (the “Italian Banking Act”); and

(b) comply with any other applicable laws and regulations or requirement imposed by CONSOB, the Bank
of Italy (including the reporting requirements, where applicable, pursuant to Article 129 of the Italian
Banking Act and the implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy, as amended from time to time)
and/or any other relevant Italian authority.

Any investor purchasing the Notes is solely responsible for ensuring that any offer or resale of the Notes by such
investor occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

**Grand Duchy of Luxembourg**

The offering of the Notes should not be considered a public offering of securities in the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg. This Offering Memorandum may not be reproduced or used for any other purpose than the
offering of the Notes nor provided to any person other than the recipient thereof. The Notes are offered to a
limited number of sophisticated investors in all cases under circumstances designed to preclude a distribution,
which would be other than a private placement. All public solicitations are banned and the sale may not be
publicly advertised.

The Notes may not be offered or sold to the public within the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
unless: (a) the offer is made to “qualified investors” as described in points (1) to (4) of Section I of Annex II to
MiFID II, and persons or entities who are, on request, treated as professional clients in accordance with Section
II of that Annex, or recognized as eligible counterparties in accordance with Article 30 of MiFID II unless they
have entered into an agreement to be treated as non-professional clients in accordance with the fourth paragraph
of Section I of that Annex; or (b) the offer of the Notes benefits from an exemption from, or constitutes a
transaction not subject to, the requirement to publish a prospectus pursuant to the Luxembourg law dated July
16, 2019 on prospectuses for securities, as amended, which has implemented into Luxembourg law the
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 14, 2017 on the prospectus
to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, as
amended.

**Republic of Korea**


-----

The Issuer is not making any representation with respect to the eligibility of any recipients of this Offering
Memorandum to acquire the Notes under the laws of Korea, including the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act
and regulations thereunder. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Financial Investment
Services and Capital Markets Act of Korea (“FSCMA”) and therefore may not be offered or sold (directly or
indirectly) in Korea or to any resident of Korea or to any persons for re-offering or resale in Korea or to any
resident of Korea (as defined under the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act of Korea and its enforcement
decree), except as permitted under the applicable laws and regulations of Korea.

Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold in Korea other than to “accredited investors” (as defined in
the FSCMA).

**Switzerland**

The Notes may not be publicly offered, sold or advertised, directly or indirectly, in or from Switzerland. Neither
this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the Notes constitutes a
prospectus as such term is understood pursuant to article 652a or article 1156 of the Swiss Federal Code of
Obligations or a listing prospectus within the meaning of the listing rules of the SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd., and
neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the Notes may be
publicly distributed or otherwise made publicly available in Switzerland.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made
pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes.
This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation. The securities
described in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a
“retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2
of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently,
no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK
PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is only directed at, persons who (i) are outside the
UK, (ii) have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended, (the “Financial
**Promotion Order”), (iii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth companies,**
unincorporated associations, etc.) of the Financial Promotion Order or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with
the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated (all such persons together being referred
to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted
on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this
Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant
persons. The Notes are being offered solely to qualified investors as defined in the UK Prospectus Regulation.
This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by the Financial Conduct Authority or any other competent
authority. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this Offering Memorandum or any
of its content.

**_Professional investors and ECPs only target market:_**

Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process in the United Kingdom, the target
market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this following Offering Memorandum has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA


-----

Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients as defined in Regulation (EU)
No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the
FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

Certain statements in this Offering Memorandum are not historical facts and are “forward-looking” within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. This document contains
certain forward-looking statements in various sections, including, without limitation, under the headings
“Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations,” “Industry” and “Business,” and in other sections where the Offering Memorandum includes_
statements about our intentions, beliefs or current expectations regarding our future financial results, plans,
liquidity, prospects, growth, strategy and profitability, as well as the general economic conditions of the
industries and countries in which we operate. We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking
statements in other communications. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning our plans,
objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future sales or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs,
plans or intentions relating to acquisitions, our competitive strengths and weaknesses, our business strategy and
the trends we anticipate in our industries and in the economic, political and legal environment in which we
operate and other information that is not historical information.

Words such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “suggest,” “target,” “intend,” “predict,” “project,”
“should,” “would,” “could,” “may,” “will,” “forecast,” “plan” and similar expressions or, in each case, their
negative or other variations or comparable terminology, are intended to identify forward-looking statements but
are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.

By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and
specific, and risks exist that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not
be achieved. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among other things, those listed under “Risk
_Factors,” as well as those included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. You should be aware that a_
number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the plans, objectives,
expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors include:

- failure to comply with the various licensing and accreditation requirements in the jurisdictions in which
we operate;

- termination, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of any of our licenses and authorizations, that could
result in the temporary or permanent cessation of the activities being conducted pursuant to such
license and/or authorization;

- regulatory changes and investigations driven by political and public opinion, that could affect providers
of higher education;

- adverse changes in certain macroeconomic conditions;

- our ability to maintain or increase our tuition fees;

- increased competition in the online and traditional education markets;

- failure to ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity of our IT platforms, which may result in loss or
theft of data;

- risks associated with our ability to respond to technological changes, including in relation to artificial
intelligence and machine learning, or satisfy future technology demands of our students;

- failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information
security;

- labor disputes and other labor matters leading to loss of revenue or higher costs;

- liabilities for the actions of our directors, employees, agents, representatives, advisors and
intermediaries including the risk of sanctions under the Italian Legislative Decree no.231 of June 8,
2001;


-----

- risks associated with our ability to protect our intellectual property and being subject to claims by third
parties for infringing on the intellectual property of third parties;

- being unable to attract and retain our faculty, administrators and skilled personnel;

- demand for our services being affected by employment demand, including by the Italian public
administration;

- failure to enroll new students and re-enroll existing students;

- being dependent on continued growth and acceptance of online education;

- risks associated with losing our key management personnel;

- risks associated with negative impacts on the reputation of our institutions and sector;

- risks associated with our dependence upon the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts
and brand reputation;

- risk of being subject to legal and tax proceedings in the ordinary course of our business;

- our reliance on third parties to provide certain services mainly related to orientation of new students;

- risks associated with any change in the timing of tuition fee payments, which could create cash flow
issues for us;

- risks related to failure to meet our ESG objectives and goals;

- risks related to assumptions made with respect to certain financial information;

- risks relating to the Acquisition;

- risks relating to our capital structure; and

- risks relating to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees.

The risks listed above and those further described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum
are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. New risks emerge from time to time and it is
not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the
extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

We urge you to read carefully the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Market and
_Industry Data” and “Business” for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could affect our future_
performance and the markets in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the
forward-looking events described in this Offering Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all.
Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date on which the statements were made.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a
result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety
by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer is a holding company which was incorporated on March 18, 2024 for the purpose of the Acquisition
and has not been involved in any operating activity since its incorporation. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Issuer does not hold any material assets or liabilities. As a result, this Offering Memorandum
does not present any historical financial information of the Issuer, except for certain limited pro forma financial
data presented on a consolidated basis as adjusted to give _pro forma_ effect to the Transactions. See “—As
_Adjusted Pro Forma Information.”_

_Multiversity Group_

This Offering Memorandum presents audited financial information of Multiversity S.p.A. (“Multiversity”, the
“Company” or the “Target”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Group” or the “Multiversity Group”)
including:

  - the English translation of the audited consolidated financial statements of Multiversity as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (together, the
“2023/2022 Consolidated Financial Statements”); and

  - the English translation of the audited consolidated financial statements of Multiversity S.r.l. (which
was converted into Multiversity following the 2022 Reverse Merger) and its subsidiaries as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Consolidated Financial Statements,” and together
with the 2023/2022 Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Consolidated **Financial Statements”),**

prepared in accordance with the Italian generally accepted accounting principles issued by the _Organismo_
_Italiano di Contabilità (“Italian GAAP”) and which have been audited by EY S.p.A., as stated in the English_
translation of their audit reports included therein. As a result of the 2021 Acquisition and of the subsequent 2022
Reverse Merger described further under “—2021 Acquisition and 2022 Reverse Merger” below, the financial
information of the Group as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 reflects the results of
operation and financial condition of Multiversity S.p.A. (the surviving entity) and its consolidated subsidiaries
(including the results of operations and financial condition of the entities acquired in the 2021 Acquisition
through Wversity and MultiSpa, including the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Certipass (together,
the “Perimeter Assets”)). The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects the
results of operations and financial condition of Multiversity S.r.l. (which was converted into Multiversity
following the 2022 Reverse Merger) and its consolidated subsidiaries only and does not completely reflect the
results of operations and financial condition of the Perimeter Assets. As a result, the financial information
presented as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 is not directly comparable with the financial
information presented for subsequent periods. For additional information on the 2021 Acquisition and 2022
Reverse Merger and the accounting presentation, see “—2021 Acquisition and 2022 Reverse Merger” below and
note 6.6 of the 2023/2022 Consolidated Financial Statements. From an accounting perspective, the key factors
affecting comparability between the financial information presented as of and for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2022 result from the purchase price accounting and the debt financing in connection with the 2021
Acquisition described in more detail in notes 6.2 and 6.4 of the 2023/2022 Consolidated Financial Statements.
While the 2021 Acquisition affects comparability of the presented balance sheets, amortization and finance costs
across the two periods, it does not materially affect comparability of our underlying business performance as
presented in our revenues, production value, production costs (other than increased depreciation and
amortization as a result of purchase price accounting) or EBITDA. Additionally, the Group completed the
acquisitions of Aulab and San Raffaele in September 2022 and October 2022, respectively, with these
companies being included in the consolidation perimeter from September 30, 2022 and October 31, 2022,
respectively. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Comparability—Acquisitions” and Note 6.4 of the 2023/2022_
Consolidated Financial Statements.


-----

The English translations of the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the English translation of the
Independent Auditor’s reports thereon are included in the F-Pages of this Offering Memorandum, and should be
read in conjunction with the relevant notes thereto.

In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of the financial statements
and financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and should consult their
professional advisors for an understanding of, among other things: (i) the differences between Italian GAAP,
IFRS, and other systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how those differences might affect the
financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and (ii) the impact that recent or future additions
to, or amendments of, Italian GAAP, IFRS or other principles may have had or may have on our results of
operations and/or financial condition, as well as on the comparability among or comparability to prior periods.

**2021 Acquisition and 2022 Reverse Merger**

On October 28, 2021, the newly incorporated Paganini Bidco (indirectly controlled by CVC funds) obtained the
control over the Multiversity Group through the acquisition of a 100% interest in Wversity and its subsidiaries
(including MultiSpa and Multiversity S.r.l.) and the remaining 50% interest in Certipass from Mr. Danilo
Iervolino.

On May 6, 2022, the board of directors of each of the Perimeter Assets approved the reverse merger plan of
these companies into Multiversity S.r.l. (the Target prior to the 2022 Reverse Merger), with the surviving entity
converting into Multiversity S.p.A. immediately after such reverse merger and remaining as the surviving entity.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures and percentages set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data
presented in millions or in thousands, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of
the data in the Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information.

**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

Certain parts of this Offering Memorandum contain alternative performance measures as defined by the “ESMA
Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures” issued by ESMA on October 5, 2015 (“APMs”) which are
non-GAAP measures and ratios and have thereof not been subject to audit or review. Such non-GAAP measures
include: “EBITDA,” “EBITDA Margin,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA margin,” “EBIT,”
“EBIT Margin,” “Adjusted EBIT,” “Adjusted EBIT margin,” “Net Working Capital,” “Net Invested
**Capital,” “Net Financial Indebtedness,” “Capex,” “Operating Free Cash Flow,” “Adjusted Operating**
**Free Cash Flow,” “Cash Conversion,” “Adjusted Cash Conversion,”** “Annualized run-rate Adjusted
**EBITDA.”**

We have included the non-GAAP Measures because we believe that such measures enable us to assess the
performance of our business and provide investors with additional information to enhance understanding of our
results. These non-GAAP Measures are based on a number of complex assumptions and have not been subject
to audit or review. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates and key
performance indicators are reasonable, there are inherent challenges in measuring such information. The
conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, and as a result, the assumptions and
estimates upon which the non-GAAP Measures are based may not be correct. For these reasons, non-GAAP
Measures used should not be considered as an alternative to profit (loss), revenue or any other performance
measure derived in accordance with Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting principles nor to net cash
provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as analytical
tools over and above the limitations of any accounting principles performance measures and should not be
considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Group’s results as reported under Italian GAAP. Such
non-GAAP measures may include or exclude amounts that are included or excluded, as applicable, in the
calculation of the most directly comparable measures in accordance with Italian GAAP. Their usefulness is
therefore subject to limitations, which are described below. In particular, other companies in the industry may
define the non-GAAP measures used herein, differently, which may make it difficult to compare the
performance of these entities to our performance based on similarly named measures. These measures may be
used by different companies for different purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the
circumstances of those companies. In addition, the exclusion of certain items from non-GAAP measures does


-----

not imply that these items are necessarily non- recurring. From time to time, we may exclude additional items if
we believe doing so would result in a more transparent and comparable disclosure.

You should exercise caution in comparing this data to similar measures used by other companies. The
information presented has not been prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting
standards. In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the
reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and will not be subject to
review by the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of
this information.

These measures are not measurements of performance under Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting
principles and you should not consider them as an alternative to profit/(loss) before taxes or profit/(loss) from
continuing operations determined in accordance with Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting principles, or,
as the case may be, or to cash flows from/(used in) operating activities, cash used in investing activities or cash
flow from/(used in) financing activities. These measures are not indicative of our historical operating results, nor
are they meant to be predictive of future results. Therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on this
data.

Non-GAAP Measures should be considered in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements prepared
in accordance with Italian GAAP. Although certain of these measures have been extracted or derived from the
Consolidated Financial Statements, this data has not been audited or reviewed.

Each of the non-GAAP measures presented in this Offering Memorandum are defined below. For further
information, including definitions and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures prepared on a management
basis to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP, see
“Summary — Summary Financial and Other Information — Summary Other Financial and Operating Data.”

**_EBITDA and EBITDA Margin_**

We define EBITDA as the sum of profit after tax, income taxes, value adjustments of financial assets, financial
income and expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses and amortization and depreciation.

We present EBITDA because we believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluate the Group’s operating
performance on a consistent basis over time. EBITDA makes the underlying performance of our business more
visible by factoring out depreciation and amortization, interest income and interest expenses and income tax
expenses. This measure is also commonly used by investors, analysts and rating agencies to assess performance.

We define EBITDA Margin as the ratio between EBITDA and the value of production and is used by the Group
as a supplemental measure of operating performance.

**_Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin_**

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for write-offs and non-recurring items.

We present Adjusted EBITDA because it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of the Group’s
ongoing operating performance and allows us to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and
benchmark performance between periods. We believe that adjusting for these items that are not directly related
to our operational performance increases comparability and enables a better understanding of the underlying
performance of the Group.

We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as the ratio between Adjusted EBITDA and the value of production.

**_EBIT and EBIT Margin_**

We define EBIT as the sum of profit after tax, income taxes, value adjustments of financial assets, financial
income and expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses.

We present EBIT because we believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluate the Group’s operating performance
on a consistent basis over time. EBIT makes the underlying performance of our business more visible by


-----

factoring out interest income and interest expenses and income tax expenses. This measure is also commonly
used by investors, analysts and rating agencies to assess performance.

We define EBIT Margin as the ratio between EBIT and the value of production, and is used by the Group as a
supplemental measure of operating performance.

**_Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT Margin_**

We define Adjusted EBIT as EBIT adjusted for non-recurring items and goodwill amortization related to the
initial purchase price allocation.

We define Adjusted EBIT margin as the ratio between Adjusted EBIT and the value of production.

**_Net Working Capital_**

We define Net Working Capital as the sum of inventories, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current
and non current liabilities, including deferred revenue.

We present Net Working Capital because we believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluate our operating
liquidity.

**_Net Invested Capital_**

We define Net Invested Capital as the sum of tangible and intangible assets, net working capital, other non
current assets and liabilities, and investments.

We present Net Invested Capital because we believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluate our investments and
liquidity.

**_Net Financial Indebtedness_**

We define Net Financial Indebtedness as the sum of liquidity and financial indebtedness (current and noncurrent).

**_Capex_**

We define Capex as the sum of cash outflow from investing in property, plant and equipment and in intangible
assets.

**_Operating Free Cash Flow_**

We define Operating Free Cash Flow as EBITDA less Capex and Change in Net Working Capital (which
reflects the change in inventories, trade receivables and trade payables and net of accruals and deferrals during
the period).

**_Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow_**

We define Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less Capex and Change in Net Working
Capital.

**_Cash Conversion_**

We define Cash Conversion as the ratio of (i) the Operating Free Cash Flow; and (ii) EBITDA.

**_Adjusted Cash Conversion_**

We define Adjusted Cash Conversion as the ratio of (i) the Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow; and (ii)
Adjusted EBITDA.


-----

**_As Adjusted Pro Forma Information_**

The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect
the impact of any changes to the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet or the
consolidated cash flow statement that may occur as a result of the Transactions. Accordingly, our historical
results may not be indicative of our future results following completion of the Transactions.

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited as adjusted pro forma financial information of the
Issuer, which is based on our consolidated financial information, on an as adjusted basis to illustrate the _pro_
_forma effect of the Transactions on the indebtedness, cash position and interest expense of the Group as of and_
for the year ended December 31, 2023. Such as adjusted pro forma financial information has been prepared for
illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual interest expense would have been had the
Transactions occurred on January 1, 2023 or what our actual cash position or indebtedness would have been had
the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2023, nor does it purport to project our indebtedness, cash position
or interest expense at any future date. The as adjusted pro forma information has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or
any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the
resulting adjusted pro forma information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally
accepted auditing standards.

Neither our independent auditors nor any other independent auditors have audited, reviewed, compiled or
performed any procedures with respect to the as adjusted pro forma information for the purpose of its inclusion
herein or for any other purposes and, accordingly, neither our independent auditors nor any other independent
auditors have expressed an opinion or provided any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of
this Offering Memorandum. The unaudited as adjusted pro forma financial information should be read in
conjunction with the information contained in “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere_
in this Offering Memorandum.

**Academic year**

Certain measures included in this Offering Memorandum are presented for a specific academic year. References
in this Offering Memorandum to “academic year” or “A/Y” refer to the academic year starting August 1 of the
preceding calendar year and ending July 31 of that calendar year. For example, 2022/2023 academic year refers
to the academic year starting in August 1, 2022 and ending in July 31, 2023.

**Market and Industry Data**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the markets in
which we operate and compete. Certain market and industry data and certain forward-looking industry
statements were extracted from market research, governmental and other publicly available information,
independent industry publications. These external sources include, among others, third party commercial advisor
reports, including a commercial vendor due diligence report (the “Market Report”) prepared for Multiversity
by a global management company (the “Global Management Company”). Industry publications, surveys,
forecasts and reports prepared by industry consultants generally state that the information contained therein has
been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but some of the information may have been derived from
estimates or subjective judgments or may have been subject to limited audit or validation and there is no
guarantee, representation or warranty (either expressly or implied) of the accuracy or completeness of such data
or changes to such data following publication thereof. The information in this Offering Memorandum that has
been sourced from third parties has been accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain
from the information published by such third parties, no facts have been omitted that would render the
reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such third-party information
has not been independently verified, and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this Offering Memorandum. Third
party sources explicitly disclaim any liability for any loss or damage, howsoever caused, arising from any errors,
omissions or reliance on any information or views contained in their reports. Forecasts and other forwardlooking information obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and uncertainties as the
other forward-looking statements in this Offering Memorandum. See “Information Regarding Forward-Looking
_Statements.”_


-----

In addition, certain information in this Offering Memorandum for which no source is given, is not based on
published statistical data or information obtained from independent third parties. Such information and
statements reflect our best estimates based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and
associations and other contacts within the industries in which we compete, as well as information published by
our competitors. To the extent that no source is given for information contained in this Offering Memorandum,
or such information is identified as being our belief, that information is based our experience, our evaluation of
industry information, our determination of our addressable markets and our own investigation of market
conditions. As some of the foregoing information was compiled or provided by our management or advisers and
is not publicly available, such information accordingly may not be considered to be as independent as that
provided by other third-party sources.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the consequences of
purchasing, holding and disposing of the Notes, including, without limitation, the application of U.S. Federal tax
laws to their particular situations, as well as any consequences to them under the laws of any other taxing
jurisdiction, and the consequences of purchasing the Notes at a price other than the initial issue price in the
Offering. See “Certain Italian Tax Considerations” and “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

We own or have rights to certain trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our
businesses. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of any other company appearing in this Offering
Memorandum belongs to its holder.

**Overview**

**_General_**

Established in 2006, Multiversity is the leading university in the Italian online higher education market with
approximately 151,000 undergraduate enrolled students (and approximately 206,000 enrolled students in total)
for the 2022/2023 academic year. Based on the number of university students enrolled for the 2022/2023
academic year, the company has an estimated market share in the Italian online academic education of 57%, an
estimated market share in the Italian academic education (across both physical and online universities) of 8%[1]
and a student satisfaction rate of 98%[2]. Multiversity also has a leading role in the foundation of UNITED (the
first association of Italian online universities). It operates several education assets, and in particular:

  - Online universities: Multiversity operates three fully licensed private online universities in Italy with
MIUR accreditations: Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. (“Pegaso”), Universitas Mercatorum
(“Mercatorum”) and Università Telematica San Raffaele Roma S.r.l. (“San Raffaele”). It provides a
student centric proposition with a wide array of undergraduate and post graduate courses to
approximately 206,000 students for the 2022/2023 academic year and is supported by a strong
professor base (10 Multiversity professors have been included in the “Top Scientists – World Top 2%”
ranking from Stanford University). Degrees awarded at the end of academic courses have the same
legal value as degrees issued by traditional universities. 97.4% of Multiversity’s revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2023 was generated by the university segment.

  - Non-academic courses and certifications: Multiversity has also expanded into a complementary nonuniversity education segment, mainly focusing on: (i) B2B and B2C executive education through Sole
24 Ore Formazione S.p.A. (“Sole 24 Ore Formazione”), (ii) digital skills through Aulab S.r.l.
(“Aulab”), a coding factory, which delivers short term courses for software developers, and (iii) a
certification entity, Certipass S.r.l. (“Certipass”). 2.3% of Multiversity’s revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2023 was generated by the non-academic education segment.

  - Other assets: Multiversity also operates a number of academies offering courses on specific subjects
(e.g. communication, marketing and law) as well as other assets (e.g. Principe di Napoli, which
provides gastronomy and tourism higher education, or Benecon, a research center promoted by the
Campania Region). 0.3% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were
generated by the other assets segment.

Multiversity delivers its services through a proprietary online platform that produces its e-learning content,
which is developed in-house. In addition, Multiversity is also a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in
education, in particular for marketing purposes and for the development of new use cases (such as its Tutor
Chatbot and Exam Generator applications).

Pegaso is Multiversity’s largest university. Approximately 140,000 students were enrolled in Pegaso’s online
courses for the 2022/2023 academic year. Pegaso offers a range of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses,
and in particular eight undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single cycle fiveyear degree and 158 courses, including postgraduate master’s courses and higher education and specialization
courses for professionals and high school graduates. Pegaso also offers individual certifications and gives
students the possibility to undertake single examinations for each course module upon payment of a fee without
having to complete the full course.

Multiversity’s second key institution, Mercatorum, is 66.67% owned by Multiversity, with the remaining
33.33% stake held by Unioncamere, the Italian Union of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and
Agriculture, which is the public body that unifies and institutionally represents the Italian system of chambers of
commerce. Approximately 53,000 students were enrolled in Mercatorum for the 2022/2023 academic year.
Mercatorum’s core offering consists of 14 undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees,
five Ph.D. programs and 121 courses, including postgraduate master’s courses and higher education and
specialization courses for professionals and high school graduates.

Multiversity’s third primary institution in terms of revenue, San Raffaele, became part of the Group in 2022, and
it is wholly owned by Multiversity. San Raffaele delivers courses mainly related to biomedical and healthcare
sciences, and it ranks first in research quality among digital universities and fifth among the entire national
university system.[3] Approximately 13,000 students were enrolled in San Raffaele for the 2022/2023 academic
year, and its core offering currently consists of four undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, three specialist master’s
degrees, six Ph.D. programs and 39 postgraduate master’s courses.

**_Non-academic courses and certifications_**

In relation to the non-university education segment, Multiversity operates Sole 24 Ore Formazione in
partnership with Il Sole 24 Ore S.p.A. (with Multiversity holding a majority stake of 85%) to deliver B2B and
B2C executive master's courses to professionals and young graduates. As part of the B2B offerings, Multiversity
also offers compulsory courses, soft skills, industry and managerial training to corporates. These courses can be
offered as off-the shelf, co-designed or fully customized. The B2B courses can vary in length, while the B2C
courses typically last one to six months. The new partnership benefits from a top level academic and scientific
training offer, thanks to the support of the universities that are part of the Group as well as the support and the
strong brand recognition of the Il Sole 24 Ore group (owning the 15% of Sole 24 Ore Formazione), one of the
leading finance newspapers in Italy, which provides content to readers, professionals, businesses, and
institutions on topics of economics, finance, and management. Additionally, Multiversity owns 60.61% of
Aulab, a player in the digital training sector for developers with a high placement rate of its students thanks to
an effective training model for coding and IT education, an efficient placement platform and partnerships with
top companies. This training model requires no pre-requisites and typically lasts from three to six months. In
addition to training, Aulab also designs and develops websites, IT platforms and software applications. The nonuniversity segment also includes Certipass, a provider of international EIPASS certifications for digital
competences and IT skills.

**_Academies and other assets_**

The Group also includes a number of academies established through collaboration agreements between Pegaso,
Mercatorum and San Raffaele and their respective commercial partners, covering a wide range of specialist
subjects such as marketing, communications and media and teaching. Other assets include Principe di Napoli
S.a.r.l. (“Principe di Napoli”), established in February 2019 by Pegaso in partnership with Mercatorum
(holding 90% and 10% stakes, respectively) as a center for higher education and specialization in the sectors of
gastronomy and tourism. Apart from the Postgraduate School in Legal Professions (as further described below),
Principe di Napoli is one of the few institution within Multiversity to hold on premise courses. Additionally, in
December 2023, the Group acquired a minority stake in Materias S.r.l., an incubator of scientific research
activities engaged in identifying innovative ideas in the field of advanced materials, primarily generated from
the academic sector.

Multiversity also operates a publishing entity and companies dedicated to research, which are mostly ancillary
and in support of the three universities. Almost the entirety of its operations are located in Italy, with some
limited operations in Malta (Pegaso International). It also has collaboration agreements with several partners in

3 VQR – Evaluation of Research Quality for the period 2015-2019, conducted by ANVUR.

Italy for the development and delivery of specialized courses in a multitude of subjects, made available through
its three universities.

In order to support their online offering, Multiversity’s institutions have an extensive network of approximately
1,000[4] e-learning center points (the “ELCPs”) as of December 31, 2023. The ELCPs provide information to
prospective and current students about the various institutions and serve as orientation centers for new students
throughout the entire duration of the course they undertake. The ELCP Points performed orientation activities
for approximately 61% of Multiversity’s institution’s new students as of December 31, 2023; however, the
relevant institution retains the direct relationship with student as it manages the enrollment process and tuition
fee payments directly with the student[5]. As regards the ELCP Points across Certipass, these purchase EIPASS
cards from Certipass and on-sell them to customers who wish to obtain an EIPASS certification. All ELCPs are
managed by external third parties that have entered into specific accreditation agreements with Pegaso,
Mercatorum, San Raffaele or Certipass (in some cases, more than one institution has entered into an
accreditation agreement with the same ELCP). See “Material Contracts—Accreditation agreements for ELCPs”
below.

**_Financial Performance_**

Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to €419.9 million, as
compared to €332.0 million for the prior financial year ended December 31, 2022 (an increase of 26.5%).
Enrolled undergraduate students at Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele increased by approximately 28% in
the 2022/2023 academic year with respect to the 2021/2022 academic year.

In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generated for the year ended December 31, 2023 was €247.2 million as
compared to €200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (an increase of 23.6%). Adjusted EBITDA
margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 58.9%, as compared to 60.2% for the year ended December
31, 2022.

Furthermore, Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow generated for the year ended December 31, 2023 was €226.0
million, as compared to €157.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (an increase of 43%). Adjusted
Cash Conversion for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 91%, as compared to 79% for the year ended
December 31, 2022 (an increase of 12%).

**_Business Model_**

Multiversity’s business model is based on a student-centric offering of a flexible learning experience and access
to teaching content through its proprietary and technologically advanced e-learning platform. Multiversity’s
universities address specific unmet demand in the market for a flexible path to an undergraduate degree, whilst
catering to specific professions for postgraduate continuous learning.

Revenues are mainly driven by tuition fees paid by students, which contributed to 75%[6] of Multiversity’s
revenues. Almost the entirety of tuition fees is self-funded by students, with less than 1% paid through
scholarships. The levels of tuition fees in turn depend on the number of students, the nature or class of degree
undertaken, the year of enrollment, the type of course and the student’s selected enrollment channel, amongst
other factors. Undergraduate degrees, which are multi-year courses (three-year bachelor’s degree plus a twoyear specialist master’s degree, or a single-cycle five-year degree), are a recurring multi-year revenue stream for
the term of the program (consisting of both the tuition fees and any other ancillary fees), which has an average
course length of approximately 2.4 years. Approximately 30% of Multiversity's graduates who have completed
three-year undergraduate degree courses wish to continue their education and apply to enroll in two-year
specialist master’s degree and master’s degree courses with the same institution.

On the other hand, one-year postgraduate courses (i.e. second level master’s which may be undertaken by
students who have already completed a three year undergraduate bachelor’s degree plus a two year specialist
master’s degree or a single-cycle five year degree), together with higher education courses and specialization
courses, provide a one-off tuition fee payment per student, accounting for 6% of Multiversity’s revenues for the

financial year ended December 31, 2023. Various other services offered to students provide additional revenue
such as fees payable in order to take examinations in an alternative location, and certificates; such additional
services accounted for approximately 14% of Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31,
2023. Single exams contributed to 1% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. The
non-academic business segment (including Certipass, Aulab and Sole 24 Ore Formazione) accounted for 2% of
Multiversity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The other assets segment (which include Principe di Napoli, Benecon and other smaller companies) accounted
for 0.3% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.

With respect to student orientation, around 61% of new students as of December 31, 2023 (contributing to 62%
of commercial revenues for the 2022/2023 academic year) across Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele partook
in orientation activities at the approximately 1,000 ELCPs that make up Multiversity’s national network.
Approximately 39% of students as of December 31, 2023 (contributing to 38% of commercial revenues for the
2022/2023 academic year) were reached through traditional marketing methods, e.g. billboards and TV
advertising campaigns on both private and public Italian channels, as well as through its extensive online
presence on social media and online advertising, thereby gaining access to the widest possible audience and
delivery tangible results, with an increase in new leads of 50% in 2023 compared to 2022. Multiversity has
established a nation-wide presence, with approximately 100 exam venues located in prestigious and historical
buildings, along with a strong online social community and proprietary technology platforms for online classes,
exams and tutoring.

Multiversity’s growth strategy is predominantly based on expanding volumes by increasing market penetration
within the population, whilst selectively increasing its course offering, its brand awareness, digital marketing
practices and _ad hoc_ orientation services to prospective students as well as by entering into commercial
agreements and partnerships.

Additionally, revenues are driven by increases in our tuition fees taking into account inflation and other
commercial considerations. For example, Multiversity increased its undergraduate tuition fees for newly
enrolling students by approximately 8% on average for the 2022/2023 academic year, as compared to the prior
academic year. See further “—Competitive Strengths” and “—Business Strategy” below.

The main objective underpinning Multiversity’s business strategy is to consolidate its market position and
strengthen its position as the leading entirely online education group in the Italian market, employing both
Business-to-Consumer and Business-to-Business marketing strategies in order to target an ever-wider audience
of students. See further “—Competitive Strengths” and “—Business Strategy” below.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Multiversity operates in the sizeable Italian higher education market which is highly attractive due to its_**
**_structurally low graduate penetration, providing online universities an opportunity to fill the education_**
**_deficit_**

Multiversity benefits from operating in the sizeable Italian higher education market (1.9 million undergraduate
students in Italy across online and traditional universities for the 2022/2023 academic year compared to 1.8
million undergraduate students for the 2020/2021 academic year)[7], where graduate penetration lags behind other
European countries. University graduate penetration[8] in Italy stood at only 29% in 2020 (increasing from 25%
in 2015), compared to 44% on average for the EU, 56% for the U.K., 49% for France, 47% for Spain and 35%
for Germany for the same period.[9] This low penetration is due to a number of structural factors in Italy
described further below, the combination of which allows online universities such as Multiversity to fill the
education deficit.
Accessibility to physical universities in Italy remains challenging due to a number of factors, including (i) a high
geographic dispersion of the population in Italy when compared to other major European countries, with 52% of
Italians living in non-metropolitan areas[10] (compared to an average of 29% for Spain, the U.K., France and

Further, Multiversity has a strong cash generation profile, supported by an asset-light structure and limited
capital expenditure. A combination of these features along with Multiversity’s track record of organic growth
has supported its deleveraging as illustrated below:

_Notes:_
_1._ _Net leverage as shown in the chart is defined as the ratio of (i) Total Financial Indebtedness as adjusted for repayment obligations with_
_respect to excess tuition fees received over (ii) Adjusted EBITDA._

_2._ _As adjusted for the 2021 Acquisition, the issuance of the Existing Notes and the 2022 Reverse Merger._

Multiversity’s organic growth has largely been driven by undergraduate enrollment. New undergraduate
enrollments have continued to grow over the years, increasing from around 50,000 in the 2017/2018 academic
year to around 151,000 in the 2022/2023 academic year. Undergraduate enrollment tends to have a longer
duration compared to graduate enrollment, with a strong conversion rate (40% of graduates from 3-year degree
programs apply for 1- or 2-year master’s degrees). These dynamics together with a low churn rate are of
particular relevance given that approximately 90% of the Group’s revenues for the year ended December 31,
2023 were generated from undergraduate programs[39], thus allowing strong visibility on future top-line
evolution.

Approximately 63% of Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 were already
secured as of January 1, 2023, primarily due to new enrollments for the 2022/2023 academic year between
August 2022 and December 2022 and to existing students’ enrollments for the 2022/2023 academic year,
while approximately 37% of revenues for the same period were derived from new students enrolled from
January 1, 2023.

39 Includes undergraduate, service fees, offsite exam, grants, graduation fees.

access at their own time); an engaging user experience delivered through a proprietary and differentiated
cutting-edge technology platform, complete with a personalized student dashboard and virtual support; strong
brand recognition; a capillary network of physical ECLPs and exam centers; and attractive pricing.

Additionally, in line with the 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals, we remain committed to
delivering an inclusive and accessible education, promoting opportunities of continuous learning for everyone,
and facilitating access to job opportunities for Multiversity students.

**_Continue to invest in academic quality and research, improving the student learning experience along with_**
**_facilitating effective placement into the job market_**

The breadth of Multiversity’s offering is one of the factors behind its success. Multiversity’s commitment to the
continuing investment in and improving of academic quality and research represents a core priority of our
strategy. We intend to continue growing Multiversity’s base of professors and focus on attracting highly
respectable professors with strong academic backgrounds, high publication rates and high rankings within their
respective fields.

Additionally, the level and quality of Multiversity’s educational offering is continuously monitored through a
comprehensive quantitative framework through which we track over 25 KPIs, which are actively monitored to
ensure the effectiveness of Multiversity’s educational offering and student placement. The framework operates
in three-steps: (i) first, we analyze an inbound student’s profile using demographic and education background
data; (ii) second, we measure the effectiveness of the delivery of Multiversity’s in-classroom and out-ofclassroom educational offering by tracking faculty excellence (such as publications, citations and research) and
learning outcome metrics (such as graduation, re-enrollment, churn rate and satisfaction); and (iii) lastly, we
measure post-degree placement performance, including employment rates and yearly salaries. This holistic
framework is critical to the ongoing development of Multiversity’s educational offering and supporting the
delivery of educational outcomes and high satisfaction to Multiversity students.

A number of further opportunities to enhance the overall student learning experience are generated by
developments in AI. Multiversity has already launched certain AI tools and services, including a Tutor Chatbot,
and will remain committed to innovation and investment through AI in augmentation of curriculum
development, compliance with standards, automatization of support services and other areas.

Beyond investments in academia, we believe Multiversity has the ability to further leverage its cutting-edge
technological platform to deliver educational content in a streamlined, intuitive and efficient manner within and
beyond its core education segments. Multiversity’s technological platform, which is supported by an internal IT
team with full back- and front-end capabilities, is proprietary and scalable. All of Multiversity’s library content,
consisting of over 30,000 hours of video across 40 undergraduate courses and 300 other courses including postgraduate and master’s courses, is produced in-house with a 1-6 month time-to-market, from designing a course
to making it available to students.

**_Maximize operating and financial performance_**

We continuously monitor and evaluate Multiversity’s operational performance to identify opportunities for
enhancement and to capitalize on embedded growth.

Multiversity continues to place significant emphasis on managing its costs efficiently, benefiting from higher
operating leverage and maintaining operational flexibility. This efficient production capability, together with
Multiversity’s current and relevant content library and proprietary platform, support Multiversity’s scalable
business model and sustained organic growth. We believe that Multiversity’s strong growth, combined with its
limited capital expenditure requirements, high cash conversion capabilities, and strong profitability margins,
will continue to generate significant cash flows to enable operational deleveraging.

We also seek to continue to generate tuition fee growth above cost inflation. Multiversity’s value proposition is
accessible at an affordable price, as Multiversity’s average tuition fee of €2,000 for the 2023/2024 academic
year is below both the average of Multiversity’s competitors and the average price students are prepared to pay
for online undergraduate university education. When combined with growing demand for online education,
Multiversity’s strong brand awareness and reputation provide us with the opportunity to continue to grow our
revenues organically while sustaining our margins.


-----

**_Pursue opportunities to grow selectively beyond Multiversity’s core undergraduate education segments and_**
**_online delivery model, leveraging the Group’s existing capabilities and integration track-record_**

We will continue to assess and pursue opportunities to grow beyond the core university segment by leveraging
Multiversity’s brand and capabilities, as well as through Multiversity’s existing non-university education
platform (including the provision of B2B/B2C executive education through the Sole 24 ORE Formazione
partnership and Multiversity’s Aulab coding factory) and selectively pursuing growth opportunities to further
broaden the reach of Multiversity’s business model.

In particular, we have identified three strategic initiatives for potential international expansion:

  - **Bolt-on acquisitions: Multiversity considers select opportunities for expansion through bolt-on**
acquisitions on an opportunistic basis, such as acquiring physical or online universities. Over recent
years, Multiversity has demonstrated its M&A capabilities with a successful execution track-record and
established processes for the efficient integration of acquired companies within the Group.

  - **Organic growth and partnerships: Multiversity has identified opportunities to expand into select**
Mediterranean countries, to leverage the Pegaso International brand and to establish partnerships with
local universities to offer an EU-recognized education in countries with a high propensity of emigration
to Italy and other countries in the European Mediterranean region, contributing to faster organic
expansion.

  - **Digital partnerships: Given its proprietary technological platform, we believe that Multiversity has**
the opportunity to form digital partnerships with education providers in developing countries to offer
technical support and online platforms, marketing strategy and other services to deliver university
content locally.

Within Italy, Multiversity's growth strategy will be focused on (i) consolidation of its university business
through the opportunistic acquisition of digital universities and the pursuit of physical opportunities, while
seeking to move towards a hybrid model and (ii) the expansion of its non-university offering synergistically,
through which it aims to strengthen its value proposition, widen its course offering and increase its presence in
the B2C/B2B continuous learning space.

**Recent Developments**

**_Trading Update_**

Based on unaudited preliminary management accounts, the Group’s estimated revenues[41] for the last twelve
months ended February 29, 2024 amounted to €431.4 million, which represented an increase of 25.3% from
€344.2 million for the last twelve months ended February 28, 2023. These results were driven by the increase of
new enrollments for the period and undergraduate students enrolled during previous academic years, together
with the effects of the acquisition of San Raffaele. The estimated Adjusted EBITDA margin for the last twelve
months ended February 29, 2024 was broadly in line with the Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended
December 31, 2023.

**Information about the Issuer**

is registered with the Companies’ Registry (Registro delle Imprese) of Milano, Monza, Brianza, Lodi under No.

Italy.

**The Transactions**

The transactions consist of the Acquisition and the Financing each as further described below (collectively, the
“Transactions”).

**_The Acquisition_**

On March 28, 2024, the Issuer entered into an acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with
Paganini Investment S.à r.l (the “Seller”), relating to the sale and purchase of the entire issued share capital of
the Target held by the Seller (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition is being effected in connection with the
indirect transfer of the Target by the fund known as “CVC Capital Partners VII Limited” (“CVC VII”) and
certain minority shareholders to CVC Capital Partners Pachelbel (A) SCSp (the “CV”) and the fund known as
“CVC Capital Partners VIII Limited” (“CVC VIII”), which will invest indirectly in the Issuer through an SCARAIF to be incorporated in due course, on arm’s length terms. As part of the proposed Acquisition, limited
partners in CVC VII will have the opportunity to make a commitment to the CV in an amount equal to up to
100% of the net cash distribution received by them from CVC VII as a result of the proposed Acquisition.
Investors in the CV are expected to include certain limited partners of CVC VII who make a commitment to the
CV (as described above) as well as certain new investors. In addition, certain co-investors, including certain
members of the management of the Target who currently hold a minority shareholding in the Seller, are
expected to reinvest in Holdco, an indirect holding company of the Issuer.

As a consequence of the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, certain options in respect of
shares in the capital of the Target shall become exercisable pursuant to the Target’s stock option plan (such
shares to be issued by the Target upon exercise of the options being the “SOP Shares”). Such SOP Shares
called are expected to be purchased by the Issuer pursuant to a minority sale and purchase agreement to be
entered into on the Acquisition Closing Date (the “SOP SPA”). Completion under the SOP SPA will occur
substantially simultaneously with completion of the Acquisition such that, after completion of both the
Acquisition and the SOP SPA, the Issuer will hold the entire issued share capital in the Target.

The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to customary conditions. Upon consummation of the
Acquisition, CV and CVC VIII will indirectly acquire approximately 92% of the ownership interests in the
Group, with the remaining 8% being indirectly held by certain minority co-investors, including members of the
Target’s management (pursuant to a reinvestment in Holdco of the distribution received by them as a result of
the proposed Acquisition).

**_The Financing_**

The financing for the Acquisition consists of the Notes offered hereby, an equity contribution to be made by CV
and CVC VIII and certain co-investors, including certain members of the management of the Target who


-----

currently hold a minority shareholding in the Seller (pursuant to a reinvestment in Holdco as described above)
(together, the “Equity Contribution”).

In addition, on or about the Issue Date, certain lenders will make available to the Target, a new revolving credit
facility under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of up to €200.0 million
(“Revolving Credit Facility”), effective from the Acquisition Closing Date. The Revolving Credit Facility will
refinance the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, which will be cancelled in connection therewith. The Existing
Notes and certain other financial indebtedness of the Target are expected to remain outstanding, on an as
adjusted basis after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as set out under “Capitalization.”

The foregoing financing arrangements, together with the application of proceeds thereof as set out under “Use of
_Proceeds,” are referred to herein as the “Financing.”_

**Post-Closing Reorganization**

Following the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
the Post-Closing Reorganization (as defined herein) as a result of which the Issuer will merge into the Target
under a reverse merger (with the Target being the surviving entity) within 18 months following the Acquisition
Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The Post-Closing Reorganization is subject to certain
conditions, including legal and regulatory approvals and may not be completed. See also “Risks Related to the
_Group’s Capital Structure—We may be unable to complete the Post-Closing Reorganization within the_
_anticipated timeframe, or at all.”_

**Escrow Arrangements**

Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the
Offering on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Account in the name of
the Issuer but controlled by the Escrow Agent, and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee for
the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

The release of the Escrowed Property will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the
consummation of the Acquisition on or about, and in any event within three business days, following the date of
release of the Escrowed Property. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price of
each series of Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate initial issue price of such series of Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the special mandatory
redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In the
event that the consummation of the Acquisition is expected to occur on or about, and in any event, within three
business days of, the Issue Date, the gross proceeds of the Offering may be directly utilized by the Issuer to,
_inter alia, complete the Acquisition as described in the section “Use of Proceeds” without being subject to the_
escrow arrangements described in this Offering Memorandum. In which case, the escrow-related mechanics (but
not the special mandatory redemption provisions) described in this Offering Memorandum shall be deemed
redundant, except as set forth in the following sentence. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption.” In the event that, the Acquisition is not consummated within three business_
days following the release of the gross proceeds of the Offering (or the Escrowed Property, as applicable), the
Issuer shall deposit (or redeposit) with the Escrow Agent such amount, which shall thereupon be held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge and subject to the terms
therein.

Upon release of the proceeds from escrow, the proceeds of the Offering will be used as described in the section
titled “Use of Proceeds.”

The Escrowed Property will be limited to the gross proceeds from the Offering, together with any earnings
thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest on
each series of Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption. In the event that the
special mandatory redemption price payable upon such special mandatory redemption of the Notes exceeds the
amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, Holdco is expected to make an equity contribution to the Issuer to
fund the difference between the applicable special mandatory redemption price and the amount of the Escrowed
Property pursuant to a commitment provided by it.


-----

**Use of Proceeds**

On the Acquisition Closing Date, the gross proceeds of the Offering and the Equity Contribution will be used by
the Issuer to fund the Acquisition and to pay the estimated costs and expenses associated with the Transactions.
See “Use of Proceeds.”

Pledge (as defined below) over the entire issued share capital of
the Target (the Existing Target Share Pledge as so confirmed and
extended being the “Target Share Pledge”). The Issuer Share
Pledge and the Target Share Pledge are collectively referred to as
the “Collateral.”

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Existing Notes
and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first

-----

ranking share pledge over the entire issued share capital of the
Target (the “Existing Target Share Pledge”). On or about the
Acquisition Closing Date, the Existing Notes and the Revolving
Credit Facility will be secured by the Issuer Share Pledge and the
Target Share Pledge. As a result, following the Acquisition
Closing Date (and subject to the accession of the Issuer, Holdco
and the Trustee to the Intercreditor Agreement as described
above), the Collateral will secure the liabilities under the Notes,
the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility which will
be secured on a pari passu basis by the Collateral, subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security
Principles and the terms of the security documents.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of

_Future Notes Guarantees—Creditors under the Revolving Credit_
_Facility, certain hedging liabilities and certain debt that we may_
_incur in the future will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds_
_of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the_
_Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The security interests in the Collateral may be limited by
applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit their
validity and enforceability. See “Description of the Notes,”

certain circumstances. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the_
_Notes.”_

**Guarantors ..............................................** The Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. Following the
Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Target to guarantee the Notes
within 120 days following the Acquisition Closing Date, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles. Our ability to procure the
Upstream Guarantee is subject to certain material legal and
contractual limitations (including the completion of the
Whitewash Procedure), which may limit the value of such
Guarantee or result in us not being able to provide it at all as
described under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Collateral, the_
_Upstream Guarantee and any future guarantees or security of the_
_Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and_
_may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses_
_that may limit their validity and enforceability.”_

**Ranking of the Guarantees ....................** The Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

                    - be general senior obligations of such Guarantor;

                    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and
future obligations of the relevant Guarantor and other
obligations that are not expressly subordinated in right of
payment to such Guarantee;

                    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
obligations of the relevant Guarantor that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee;

                    - rank effectively senior to any existing and future
obligations of the relevant Guarantor that are not secured
on the Collateral owned by such Guarantor to the extent
of the value of the Collateral;

                    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
obligations of the relevant Guarantor that are secured by
property and assets that do not secure such Guarantee, to
the extent of the value of the property and assets securing
such obligations; and

                    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future
obligations of the subsidiaries of the relevant Guarantor
that do not provide Guarantees.

The Guarantees will be subject to certain material contractual and
legal limitations, as described under “Description of the Notes,”
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations” and “Risk Factors.”_

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory**
**Redemption .............................................**


Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers
will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering on the Issue
Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow
Account in the name of the Issuer but controlled by the Escrow
Agent, and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee
for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

The release of the Escrowed Property will be subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, including the consummation of
the Acquisition, on or about, and in any event within three
business days, following the date of release of the Escrowed
Property. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the
Escrow Longstop Date, the Notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price
of each series of Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate
initial issue price of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest, and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the
special mandatory redemption date.

In the event that the consummation of the Acquisition is expected
to occur on or about, and in any event, within three business days
of, the Issue Date, the gross proceeds of the Offering may be
directly utilized by the Issuer to, _inter alia, complete the_
Acquisition as described in the section “Use of Proceeds” without
being subject to the escrow arrangements described in this
Offering Memorandum. In which case, the escrow-related
mechanics (but not the special mandatory redemption provisions)
described in this Offering Memorandum shall be deemed
redundant, except as set forth in the following sentence. See
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption.” In the event that, the Acquisition is not_
consummated within three business days following the release of
the gross proceeds of the Offering (or the Escrowed Property, as
applicable), the Issuer shall deposit (or redeposit) with the
Escrow Agent such amount, which shall thereupon be held by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and
the Escrow Charge and subject to the terms therein.

The Escrowed Property will be limited to the gross proceeds from
the Offering, together with any earnings thereon and investments
thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and
unpaid interest on each series of Notes that may be payable in the
event of a special mandatory redemption. In the event that the
special mandatory redemption price payable upon such special
mandatory redemption of the Notes exceeds the amount of the
applicable Escrowed Property, Holdco is expected to make an
equity contribution to the Issuer to fund the difference between
the applicable special mandatory redemption price and the amount
of the Escrowed Property pursuant to a commitment provided by
it.

Guarantor (if any) or the paying agent is required by law to
withhold or deduct such taxes with respect to a payment on any
Note, such Issuer or Guarantor (if any) will pay the additional
amounts necessary so that the net amount received by each holder
after such withholding is not less than the amount that would have
been received in the absence of the withholding.

The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy and
therefore payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in
certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to
Italian tax laws and regulations. Subject to and as set forth in
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will


-----

not be liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes
if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be
amended or supplemented from time to time) (“Decree No. 239”)
or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21,
1997 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to
time) (“Decree No. 461”), except, in the case of Decree No. 239
and Decree No. 461, where the procedures required under Decree
No. 239 or Decree No. 461, as applicable, in order to benefit from
an exemption have not been complied with due to solely the
actions or omissions of the Issuer or its agents. See “Description
_of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_

Although we believe that, under current law, Italian substitute tax
will not be imposed under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461
where a holder of Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country
which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy
included in the list provided for by Italian Ministerial Decree
dated September 4, 1996, as amended from time to time, or, as
from the tax year in which the Ministerial Decree to be issued
under Article 11, paragraph 4, let. c) of Decree No. 239 is
effective, included in the list therein provided (the “White List”)
and such holder of Notes complies with certain certification
requirements, there is no assurance that this will be the case.
Moreover, holders of the Notes will bear the risk of any change in
Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 after the date hereof, including
any change in the White List countries. See “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Prospective purchasers of Notes_
should consult their tax advisors as to the overall tax
consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes
and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts
under the Notes, including, in particular, the effect of any state,
regional or local tax laws of any country or territory.

**Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons .** If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction are
announced and become effective on or after the issuance of the
Notes that would require the Issuer or the Guarantors (if any) to
pay additional amounts (as defined in “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes”), the Issuer may redeem such series of Notes_
in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to but excluding the
redemption date.

**Change of Control ..................................** Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control,
the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the
outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. However, a
change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a
specified consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is not
exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of the
_Notes—Change of Control.”_

**Tender Offers ..........................................** In connection with any tender offers for any series of Notes, if
holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
applicable outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do
not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or
any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases, all of such Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn


-----

by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right
to redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in
whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to
the price offered to each other holder of the Notes of such series
(excluding any early tender or incentive fee) plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption—General.”_

**Certain Covenants ..................................** The Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue
certain preferred stock;

                    - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
investments;

                    - make certain other restricted payments;

                    - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                    - impose restrictions on the ability of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends;

                    - transfer or sell certain assets;

                    - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                    - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders
of the Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if the Notes obtain and
maintain an investment-grade rating.

Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be subject to
significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.”_

**Transfer Restrictions ..............................** The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the
U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction.
The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale.
See “Transfer Restrictions.” We have not agreed to, or otherwise
undertaken to, register the Notes under the securities laws in any
jurisdiction (including by way of an exchange offer).

**No Established Market ..........................** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have
advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are
not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market making at
any time without notice. Accordingly, there is no assurance that
an active trading market will develop for the Notes.

**Listing ......................................................** Application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading
on the Euro MTF Market thereof in accordance with the rules
thereof. There is no assurance that the Notes will be, or will


-----

remain, listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market.

consider carefully all the information in this Offering
Memorandum and, in particular, you should evaluate the specific
risk factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section before making a
decision whether to invest in the Notes.

**Governing Law .......................................** The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by the laws of the
State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement is, and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Escrow Charge will be, governed by English law. The security

**Summary Other Financial and Operating Data**

The following tables set out the key economic and financial indicators used by our management to monitor the
group’s performance (“Alternative Performance Measures” or “APMs”) for the periods indicated. These
APMs are not recognized as measures of financial performance or liquidity under Italian GAAP, IFRS or any
other accounting standards. These APMs are used by management as a supplemental measure of performance
and should not be unduly relied on. All non-GAAP Measures are unaudited.

We define EBIT as the sum of profit after tax, income taxes, value adjustments of financial assets, financial
income and expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses, and EBIT margin as the ratio between EBIT and the
value of production. We define EBITDA as the sum of profit for the period, income taxes, effects of investments
using the equity method, financial income and expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses and amortization
and depreciation, and EBITDA Margin as the ratio between EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBIT as EBIT
adjusted for goodwill amortization and non-recurring items, and Adjusted EBIT margin as the ratio between
Adjusted EBIT and the value of production. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for bad debt
accruals and non-recurring items, and Adjusted EBITDA margin as the ratio between Adjusted EBITDA and the
value of production. For further information including definitions of these non-GAAP measures, see
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

(i)      The run-rate adjustment for enrolled students has been calculated by (i) restating the revenue related to tuition fees of newly
enrolled undergraduate students for each academic year (approximately €4 million adjustment) and (ii) annualizing the
revenues related to tuition fees for the 2023/2024 academic year of new undergraduate students enrolled between August 1,
2023 and December 31, 2023 (approximately €35 million adjustment), each as further described below.

Revenues are currently recognized in line with accounting principles but for the purposes of this adjustment have been restated
to be spread evenly between the twelve months of an academic year (running from August 1 of a given year to July 31 of the
following year). Under accounting principles, the Group recognizes revenue from tuition fees of newly enrolled students from
the enrolment date until the end of the relevant academic year, spread evenly. For new undergraduate students enrolled
between August 1 and December 31, revenues are partially recognized in the financial year in which the enrollment date occurs
and partially deferred to the next financial year. For new undergraduate students enrolled between January 1 and July 31,
revenues are fully recognized in the financial year in which the enrollment date occurs, with no revenues accrued in the
previous financial year. The revenue restatement for enrolled students has been calculated by restating the revenue related to
tuition fees of newly enrolled undergraduate students for each academic year by recognizing 5/12 of such revenues in the
financial year in which the academic year starts (i.e., to cover the period from August 1 to December 31 of such academic year)
and 7/12 in the financial year in which the academic year ends (to cover the period from January 1 until July 31 of such
academic year) irrespective of the enrollment date during the relevant academic year.

The annualization of revenues (including certain estimates) related to tuition fees for the 2023/2024 academic year of new
undergraduate students enrolled between August 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023 represents the estimated run-rate effect from


-----

an increase in undergraduate student enrollments and an increase in undergraduate tuition fees for the 2023/2024 academic
year compared to the prior academic year, as adjusted by applying the Group’s historical churn rate (5% for the year ended
December 31, 2023) and gross margin (81% for the year ended December 31, 2023). The Group’s historical churn rate reflects
the impact of student withdrawals, deferred or on-hold students, transferred students and blocked (non-paying) students. The
Group also removed the revenue relating to tuition fees for the 2022/2023 academic year of undergraduate students who
graduated during the period.

The run-rate adjustment for enrolled students is derived from management estimates, is not part of our Consolidated Financial
Statements or our accounting records and has not been audited or otherwise reviewed by our auditors. The run-rate adjustment
for enrolled students is presented for information purposes only and does not purport to represent the actual contribution of the
increase in undergraduate student enrollments or tuition fees to our results of operations and financial condition for the period
presented nor does it purport to present such contribution for any future period. The Group’s estimated run-rate adjustment for
enrolled students is based on a number of estimates and assumptions made in reliance on the information available at the time
made and judgments based on such information, including the number of students expected to enrol between the date of
calculation and July 31. The assumptions used in such estimates are inherently uncertain, subject to change and could cause the
Group’s actual results to differ materially from those contained in such estimates. The Group calculated such figures based on
unaudited financial information or management schedules, which required significant assumptions and estimates and may not
be up-to-date or may not be prepared on the same basis on which the Group prepares its audited accounts. Such information
does not reflect any accounting or pro forma adjustments that may be required to present consolidated financial information.
This adjustment is for illustrative purposes only. While the Group believes these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable,
some or all of this information may prove to be inaccurate or incomplete. See “Risk Factors—We present information relating
_to Adjusted EBITDA, Annualized run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures in this Offering Memorandum;_
_certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and_
_accordingly you should not unduly rely on them.”_

(ii)      Represents the reallocation of digital marketing costs incurred by the Group over the related student lifetime (2.5 years on
average) because marketing costs incurred in a specific year generate revenues in the following years due the enrollment
renewal of students. Digital marketing costs can be directly traced to the related students’ enrollment. In addition to digital
marketing costs, the Group incurs TV marketing costs, which cannot be directly traced to students’ enrollments and have
therefore remain fully reflected in the period incurred.

(iii)      Represents an adjustment to capitalise a portion of Multiversity's IT development costs for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Multiversity carries out its IT development through internal resources and started to capitalize a portion of its IT development
costs in the year ended December 31, 2023.

(iv)      Represents the estimated run-rate effect of completed acquisitions (notably San Raffaele, Aulab and Sole 24 Ore Formazione),
reflecting the estimated incremental EBITDA in future periods due to deployment of commercial synergies and investments in
marketing and commercial initiatives made in the year ended December 31, 2023. The estimates presented above with respect
to the run-rate effects of completed acquisitions have been prepared using current estimates and taking into account certain
assumptions about future operations, including overall performance and macroeconomic conditions. There can be no assurance
that these completed acquisitions will have the desired outcomes and the costs associated with achieving them may outweigh
any benefits. The foregoing assumptions underlying the adjustments involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may
cause actual results or performance to be materially different from anticipated future results or performance expressed or
implied by such adjustments. This adjustment is for illustrative purposes only. While the Group believes these estimates and
assumptions to be reasonable, some or all of this information may prove to be inaccurate or incomplete. See “Risk Factors—
_We present information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Annualized run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures_
_in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain_
_estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them.”_

(2) Pro forma cash and cash equivalents reflects management’s estimate of cash and cash equivalents as of April 19, 2024, after
deducting certain interest and other payments to be made in April, and as further adjusted to give effect to the Transactions
(including the expected use of proceeds from the Offering). For further information, see “Capitalization.”

(3) _Pro forma net senior secured debt represents the estimated consolidated_ _pro forma senior secured long-term financial_
indebtedness of the Issuer after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, including issuance of the Notes (assuming issuance
at par), net of pro forma cash and cash equivalents.

(4) _Pro forma net debt represents the estimated consolidated pro forma long-term financial indebtedness of the Issuer, after giving_
_pro forma effect to the Transactions, including issuance of the Notes (assuming issuance at par), net of pro forma cash and cash_
equivalents.

(5) _Pro forma interest expense reflects the estimated cash interest expense on the Group’s pro forma net debt. Pro forma interest_
expense assumes that the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn during such period and excludes commitment fees payable on
the undrawn Revolving Credit Facility. Pro forma interest expense reflects interest payable per annum as adjusted for the interest
expense in respect of the Floating Rate Notes offered hereby at the rate of      %. Pro forma interest expense is presented for
illustrative purposes only, does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the Transactions
occurred on January 1, 2023 nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any future period or our financial position at
any future date.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors in the Notes should carefully_
_consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum before_
_making a decision to invest in the Notes. Any of the following risks, individually or together, could have a_
_material adverse effect on the Issuer’s business, financial position, results of operations and prospects, and_
_accordingly the value of the Notes or on the Issuer’s ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. This section_
_describes the risks and uncertainties that the Issuer believes are material, but these risks and uncertainties may_
_not be the only ones that it faces. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those of which the Issuer is_
_currently unaware or those which it deems immaterial, may also result in decreased sales, assets and cash_
_inflows, increased expenses, liabilities or cash outflows or other events that could result in a decline in the value_
_of the Notes, or which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of_
_operations and prospects and thus on its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. The order in which the_
_risks are presented does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude of their_
_potential impact on the Issuer’s business, financial position, results of operations and prospects or on the_
_trading price of the Notes. References to “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Group” are to the Issuer and its_
_consolidated subsidiaries from time to time and/or Multiversity or the Multiversity Group, as the context_
_requires._

**Risks Related to the Group’s Business and Industry**

**_Multiversity is subject to various licensing and accreditation requirements in the jurisdictions in which it_**
**_operates, and its failure to comply with these requirements could expose Multiversity to financial losses and_**
**_lead to loss of qualified personnel and students._**

Multiversity’s activities are subject to extensive regulation and obtaining and maintaining authorizations.
Individual courses offered by Multiversity’s academic institutions are also subject to various accreditation
requirements. In order to operate, Multiversity’s academic institutions have received and maintained various
accreditations and permissions from the MIUR, as well as from certain curriculum providers and examination
bodies.

The accreditation system envisaged by the regulations provides that all courses forming part of an institution’s
educational offering, except master’s courses, must be licensed every three years, and the relevant institution
must undergo a review process every five years in order to maintain its licensing. The procedure for obtaining
and maintaining the relevant license varies depending on whether the course is newly created or already
existing. See “Regulation” for further information.

As a prerequisite to obtaining and maintaining specific licenses for each course, an institution must itself have
obtained its general license to operate from the MIUR.

To maintain these accreditations and permissions, Multiversity’s Italian academic institutions must meet
standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality,
staff, administrative capability and resources. In particular, Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele, as Italian
private universities, are subject to a periodic accreditation assessment carried out by the Italian National Agency
for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes (Agenzia Nazionale di Valutazione del Sistema
_Universitario e della Ricerca or “ANVUR”), the entity to which the MIUR has delegated the task of carrying_
out a periodic qualitative assessment of the activities carried out by Italian universities and research institutes,
while Certipass is subject to Accredia certification standards. The periodic accreditation assessments are
processed following on-site visits to universities by an _ad hoc_ commission of experts appointed by ANVUR.
The periodic accreditation process is carried out in three phases: (i) a remote examination of the documentation
made available by the university to the commission, (ii) the actual on-site visit in order to examine the degree
programs and the departments selected by ANVUR for each university, and (iii) the drafting of a report by the
commission. For further information on the legislative framework and licensing and accreditation process to
which Multiversity’s academic institutions are subject, please see “Regulation.” The next periodic assessments
for Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele are due on January 2025, July 2025 and July 2024, respectively.

Depending on the outcome of ANVUR’s periodic accreditation assessment, a negative score could be assigned
to Pegaso, Mercatorum or San Raffaele, which in turn could lead to the revocation of their authorizations, in the
event that Pegaso, Mercatorum or San Raffaele is unable to improve its score as a result of continuing material

weakness following subsequent reassessment. Inspections could also lead to downgrading of the rating assigned
to any of Multiversity’s academic institutions. Any such event could result in the temporary or permanent
cessation of all or part of Multiversity’s business and/or a reduction of the academic institutions’ ability to enroll
new students or attract qualified personnel. Multiversity’s reputation would also be severely impacted.

Furthermore, on October 14, 2021, the Ministerial Decree 1154/2021 regarding the self-evaluation, evaluation,
initial and periodic accreditation of study centers and courses (“DM 2021”) was issued by the MIUR for the
2022/2023 academic year. The DM 2021, among other things and in line with industry guidelines, introduced
changes to the existing educational standards, specifically altering the requirements necessary for teaching staff
and revising the approach used to determine the ratio of lecturers to students. In particular, for study courses
accredited within the 2021/2022 academic year that do not meet the minimum teaching requirements as
stipulated by the DM 2021, universities may sign plans to achieve the aforementioned teaching requirements
(piani di raggiungimento) according to the procedures indicated in the DM 2021. These requirements must be
met within a timeframe not exceeding the standard duration of the courses plus an additional two years. This
means that the plans for achieving the teaching requirements must be met, for study courses already accredited,
no later than: (i) the 2026/2027 academic year for three-year study courses; (ii) the 2025/2026 academic year for
two-year study courses; (iii) the 2028/2029 academic year for five-year study courses; and (iv) the 2029/2030
academic year for six-year academic courses.

Multiversity has submitted plans to fulfil the teaching requirements for certain study courses at Pegaso,
Mercatorum, and San Raffaele. Failure to implement those plans may result in the inability to activate new study
courses or the deactivation of existing study courses that do not meet the teaching requirements as outlined in
such plans. The MIUR has established a technical committee, chaired by the Minister of University and
Research and composed of representatives of the university and research sector, including from private online
universities, with the purpose of reviewing the DM 2021 following proposals by online universities to return to
the previous method of calculating the need for tenured teachers, which involved tripling the number of students
due to the distinct educational model of telematic universities. The technical committee is expected to deliver its
findings on the potential revision of the DM 2021 and the upcoming three-year educational plan by the first half
of 2024. See “Regulation” for further information. Any amendment to the DM 2021 and the current regulation
of online universities may impose additional operational and/or financial obligations on private online
universities, which in turn may increase costs, require Multiversity to make additional investments, divert
management's attention from the operations of the business and adversely affect Multiversity's business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects.

In addition, the jurisdictions in which Multiversity operates (being, as of the date hereof, almost exclusively
Italy and, to a limited extent, Malta, although Multiversity degrees are recognized across the European Union)
may at any time impose additional laws, regulations or licensing requirements on online academic institutions,
or even on academic institutions in general. Such new laws could oblige Multiversity or Multiversity’s
individual institutions to obtain additional licenses, permits or accreditations, which could in turn lead it to incur
significant costs, limit or delay its ability to operate and/or to expand its business in such jurisdiction in line with
its strategic objectives. In addition, in the event that compliance with such legislative changes were to be
deemed too operationally or financially burdensome by Multiversity, Multiversity could cease to operate in the
relevant jurisdiction altogether.

In particular, Pegaso was the first university in Italy to become a limited liability company and commercial
entity. At the time of Pegaso’s transformation into a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata)
in 2019, both the Italian Council of State (Consiglio di Stato) and the MIUR issued favorable opinions on the
matter, without raising objections to the specific transaction in the absence of any express legislative provision
to the contrary. Both authorities however noted in their opinions that existing legislation does not expressly
regulate the status of universities as private corporations, and that this could, impact how the regulatory
framework is applied to open universities that take the form of private corporations. The authorities therefore
called for the government to consider proposing legislative reforms in order to exclude the risk of encountering
incompatibility issues in the practical application of the current legal framework to corporations. Furthermore,
in 2023, San Raffaele, meeting all the requirements, also transformed into a limited liability company (società a
_responsabilità limitata)._ It cannot be excluded that the authorities could in the future consider legislative
proposals in order to update the legal framework. Were such reforms to be passed into law, it cannot be
excluded that Pegaso, as the first university to transform into a private corporation, or San Raffaele could be
required to comply with enhanced legal requirements or to implement organizational or structural changes,
thereby potentially facing increased costs and hindering its ability to conduct its current business effectively. In
addition, should any further universities of the Group be similarly transformed, they would face similar


-----

uncertainties. See further “Regulation—Establishment of Pegaso and Mercatorum” and “Regulation—
_Transformation of Pegaso into a private corporation.”_

Any termination, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of any of Multiversity’s licenses and authorizations
could result in the temporary or permanent cessation of the activities being conducted pursuant to such license
and/or authorization, impact its ability to enroll new students, adversely affect Multiversity’s reputation or cause
it to incur unanticipated costs. Any of the circumstances described above are likely to have a material adverse
effect on Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Regulatory changes and investigations may be driven by political and public opinion affecting providers of_**
**_higher education._**

The success of Multiversity’s business depends significantly on compliance of its subsidiaries (including its
academic institutions) with legislation and oversight by the MIUR, mainly through ANVUR. The regulation of
alternative providers of higher education in Italy is, to a significant degree, subject to political and public
opinion on the role of the private sector in the provision of education. This may lead to the implementation of
policies that promote the preferential treatment of publicly-funded higher education providers over private
universities or higher education institutions’ ability to recruit students, which could in turn have a material
adverse impact on Multiversity’s business and results of operations.

Although Multiversity has stringent procedures in place to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations to
which it is subject, if other alternative providers abuse the system, Multiversity’s reputation may be negatively
impacted by association, thus leading to a negative impact on Multiversity’s business and financial position. See
also “—Any negative impact on the reputation of Multiversity’s institutions and sector could adversely affect its
_business”_ below.

In addition, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities in Italy or in any other jurisdiction in which
Multiversity operates will not impose restrictions on the level of tuition fees charged by its universities in the
future or any other material changes in the applicable requirements to Multiversity’s operations. Changes in
such regulations, which can often occur at short notice, could have a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, the cost structure and the business model of
Multiversity. While Multiversity’s universities have shown the ability to be able to respond effectively to
regulatory changes in the past, if the regulatory framework governing the levels of tuition fee is altered in a
manner which negatively impacts Multiversity’s tuition fee structure, its operating margins and prospects could
be adversely affected.

**_Adverse changes in certain macroeconomic factors may negatively affect Multiversity's business, results of_**
**_operations, financial condition and prospects._**

Multiversity's business may be sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending on education, which
is in turn affected by unfavorable economic conditions. Economic contraction or recession, uncertainty
regarding spending capacity and the perception by its students of weak or weakening economic conditions in
Italy and globally could cause a decline in the demand for education in the forms of private universities and
higher education courses. The outlook for the world economy remains uncertain. Material increases in global
inflation since early 2022, reaching double-digit levels not seen since the 1980s, and expectations that annual
inflation may remain high in Italy (the average inflation rate in 2023 was 5.7%), Europe and other foreign
markets for a significant period of time (driven in part by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the conflict
between Israel and Hamas and broader instability in the Middle East, which has impacted energy and shipping
markets among others) has led central banks of the major world economies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve
and the European Central Bank, to accelerate the withdrawal of emergency monetary policies and liquidity
support measures put in place prior to and during the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and to
significantly increase market interest rates in a short timeframe. As some of these measures expire, are
withdrawn or are no longer supported by governments, and as global inflation levels and interest rates continue
to remain high, economic growth may be negatively impacted, which in turn may adversely affect students’
discretionary spending and, consequently, Multiversity's business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects. Additionally, higher interest rates increase Multiversity’s overall borrowing costs.

In light of recent developments of the macroeconomic environment, an increased risk of recession, or persistent
inflation, may raise risks across markets. In particular, the current inflationary environment has resulted in an
increase in certain of Multiversity's costs, such as an increase in the cost of personnel due to the increase in


-----

wages and salaries paid. Multiversity generally seeks to pass on such increased costs through rises in tuition fee
levels; however, there can be no assurance that Multiversity will be able to pass on such costs in full or part
through tuition increases. In addition, recent bank failures, liquidity concerns and other adverse developments
affecting financial institutions, or rumors about such events, may impact the stability of global financial
markets. Additionally, in the event of weakening macroeconomic conditions, Multiversity's students may face
challenges to obtain funds to pay their tuition fees.

Multiversity could also be adversely affected by other macroeconomic or ratings events. In November 2023,
Fitch Ratings affirmed Italy’s sovereign credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook. Since May 2021, Moody’s
Investors Service has not changed Italy’s sovereign credit rating, which remains at Baa3 while in November
2023 the outlook changed to stable from negative. In October 2023, S&P Global Ratings confirmed Italy’s
sovereign credit rating at BBB while indicating a stable outlook. A change in macroeconomic or other
conditions in Italy may result in a ratings downgrade from these levels. The global credit and financial markets
have recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, due to a number of factors including diminished
liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and economic growth, high inflation in Europe
and other foreign markets, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. Volatility
in such markets can lead to a recessionary environment in Italy or the other markets in which Multiversity might
operate. Multiversity’s general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn,
volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions, including economic
instability and high inflation. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary
debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more expensive or more dilutive. Failure to secure any
necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on
Multiversity's ability to achieve its strategy and on its business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects.

**_Multiversity’s financial performance depends in part on its ability to maintain or increase its tuition fees._**

The principal factors that could have an adverse impact on Multiversity’s ability to potentially increase tuition
fees in the future in line with increasing costs include:

- negative perceptions of the quality of its services or a decline in the reputation or official rankings of
Multiversity’s academic institutions;

- resistance to tuition fee increases by tuition payers due to difficult economic conditions, including
inflation rates, interest rates and consumer confidence and disposable income levels;

- lower fees or reductions or discounts of tuition fees by new or existing competitors in the markets in
which Multiversity operates or in the traditional education market; and

- future government regulation that may impact the tuition fee structure.

As of December 31, 2023, over 75%[42] of Multiversity’s revenues were generated from tuition fees paid by
students offered at its three core institutions: Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele. The inability to maintain or
increase tuition fees as a result of these or other factors could have a material and adverse effect on
Multiversity’s business, prospects, financial conditions and results of operations.

In Italy, fees and fee increases for private schools are unregulated and are set with reference to commercial
considerations. We set our tuition fees at the start of the academic year for newly enrolling students. For
students enrolled in multiple year programs, tuition fees are set at the time of enrollment in the program. We
view tuition fee increases as an opportunity to ensure that the cost of inflation we experience can be passed on to
our students, thus supporting our operating margins. However, there can be no assurance that regulatory
authorities will not impose restrictions on the level of tuition fees charged by its universities in the future or any
other material changes in the applicable requirements to our operations.

In addition, to stimulate demand, online and traditional competitors might offer discounted tuition fees, which
might lead to increased price pressures and sharpened competition within the Italian higher education market.
As a result, Multiversity’s profitability might be affected by the risk of rising price pressure. Multiversity’s

42 Excluding any fees payable by students for ancillary services, such as supplemental tuition fee or the alternative exam location
fee.


-----

ability to respond to such pressure would depend on how quickly its institutions could adapt and adjust their
tuition fees. Any failure to adequately respond to competitors’ tuition reductions or if potential students do not
perceive the quality and value of the services offered by Multiversity’s institutions, and those institutions are
unable to compensate for the tuition decreases by attracting more students, Multiversity’s business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

**_Increased competition in the traditional and online education market could reduce enrollments, increase_**
**_Multiversity’s cost of student and staff recruitment and retention and put downward pressure on_**
**_Multiversity’s revenues and profitability._**

The online education market in Italy has significant entry barriers and is effectively closed to new entrants (see
“Regulation—The Regulatory Context of Online Universities”). Pursuant to the legislative framework in place as
of the date of this Offering Memorandum (specifically and most recently, Italian Decree no. 289 of March 25,
2021 (as may be amended or replaced, “Decree 289”)), no new licenses can be granted in order to incorporate
new online universities. Currently in Italy, eleven online universities have been authorised by the MIUR. The
prohibition on the granting of new licenses has been in place for over ten years.

Decree 289 has a duration of three years, and will last until the 2023/2024 academic year, which ends July 31,
2024. The provisions of Decree 289 shall apply until the ministerial decree establishing the general guidelines
for the 2024-2026 academic years is issued, which as of the date of this Offering Memorandum is under
discussion before the competent ministry. Should it not be extended or replaced by a similar law after such time,
or should the broader legislative framework be amended at any point in time in order to repeal Decree 289,
allowing the granting of further authorizations to new online institutions, Multiversity would face increased
competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including, for example, established
colleges and universities that had not previously offered an online education program. The new decree is
expected to be issued by the MIUR later this year providing a new three-year programme (2024-2026 academic
years) to replace Decree 289, although there can be no assurance in this regard.

Multiversity may be unable to compete successfully against future market players (for example, if Multiversity
is unable to differentiate its educational offering from those of its competitors) and may therefore face
difficulties in maintaining or increasing tuition fee levels and enrolling, retaining students and staff, thereby
increasing its expenditure in student and staff recruitment and retention activities. In addition, Multiversity’s
institutions may face increased difficulties in locating and engaging third parties as e-learning centers, thereby
limiting or reducing its geographical presence across Italy. Furthermore, Pegaso, Mercatorum or San Raffaele
could lose their market leadership position in the face of new competition, with a knock-on effect on their
reputation. These competitive factors could cause Multiversity’s enrollment figures, revenues and profitability
to materially decrease.

Additionally, Multiversity competes with traditional public and private universities, other for-profit schools,
vocational education organizations, and alternatives to higher education, such as employment and military
service. Public universities may offer programs similar to those of Multiversity’s universities without tuition or
at a lower tuition level as a result of government subsidies, government and foundation grants, tax-deductible
contributions, and other financial sources not available to private institutions. Furthermore, some of
Multiversity’s competitors in both the public and private sectors may have greater name recognition, longer
operating history and significantly greater resources, and may be able to devote greater resources to the
development, promotion and sale of their academic offering, which could allow them to respond more quickly
to changes in students’ needs. While Multiversity believes that its universities provide valuable education to its
students, it may not always accurately predict the drivers of a student’s decision to choose among the range of
educational and other options available to them. This strong competition might have a material adverse effect on
Multiversity’s ability to achieve its strategy and to increase tuition fees in line with its costs, and consequently
on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_If Multiversity is not able to ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity of its IT platforms, or fails to_**
**_adequately maintain and develop its IT platform, it could suffer loss or theft of data and risk breaching_**
**_regulations, as well as affecting the user experience of its students._**

Multiversity has continuously invested in its proprietary IT platform and systems in order to deliver among the
most advanced online learning platforms on the Italian market. The platform is fully owned by Multiversity. The
platform was developed mostly in-house in reliance on open-source software.


-----

Although Multiversity has established and maintains cybersecurity frameworks that are developed and updated
internally, including a system that monitors the platform and code transactions on it, its IT systems and
platforms may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, data
corruption, network or server failure, computer viruses, security breaches, data theft or leak of confidential
information, natural disasters, third-party intrusions or other technical malfunctions despite, where possible,
efforts to prevent such damage or interruption. As a result, Multiversity’s business could be disrupted if any of
the technologies that Multiversity uses to deliver its programs are interrupted or fail. See “Business—
_Technology Platform” for further details._

Multiversity’s business model is entirely reliant on the proper functioning of its e-learning platform and, more
generally, of its IT systems. If Multiversity is unable to continue to maintain or update its IT platform, it may
have difficulty delivering its online services. In addition, any failure to deliver its online services would have an
adverse impact on Multiversity’s operations, damage its reputation and limit its ability to attract and retain
students. Any damage or malfunction to any of these technologies may require capital expenditure to rectify and
would necessarily cause delays in Multiversity’s operations. Any material disruption or slowdown, including
those caused by Multiversity’s failure to successfully upgrade its technologies and systems, could cause some
information, including prospective student applications or student work product, to be lost or delayed when
processed. Furthermore, e-learning institutions are subject to attack by students themselves or by third parties,
particularly with the aim of retrieving official examination papers ahead of the examinations themselves in order
to leak them to all or part of the student body.

Such loss, delay or theft could result in loss of reputation and student dissatisfaction, which could in turn
adversely affect Multiversity’s reputation and business. Moreover, as a result of such a loss or delay,
Multiversity could be involved in remedial actions or legal proceedings which in turn might have a material
adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Multiversity’s institutions may not be able to respond to technological changes, including in relation to_**
**_artificial intelligence and machine learning, or satisfy future technology demands of their students and could_**
**_fall behind their competitors._**

Multiversity’s proprietary IT platform is a critical part of its strategy. Multiversity’s online and traditional
competitors that offer solutions that are similar to certain aspects of Multiversity’s IT platform might be able to
introduce more innovative and user-friendly IT platforms. Multiversity’s competitiveness in the future will
depend on Multiversity’s ability to respond to technological changes and satisfy future technology demands by
developing technological solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner. There can be no assurance that
Multiversity will be able to achieve such technological advances.

Additionally, Multiversity’s competitors’ use of new and evolving technologies, such as artificial intelligence
(“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”), may result in increased competition in the marketplace. Providing
insights from data, including through the use of AI and ML, will become increasingly important to the value
proposition that Multiversity delivers to its students. Multiversity’s platform already offers advanced IT
proprietary features and is embedding next generation AI enabled tools such as a new generative AI University
Assistant Tool that leverages OpenAI to provide students with 24/7 support through a chatbot exclusively
trained with specific course content (selected by professors). Multiversity reviews the global market for AIbased solutions in education on a weekly basis through a strategic observatory, which continuously monitors
any potential developments along with any risks and opportunities in the education space. Additionally, a
detailed risk assessment on AI adoption, which includes legal, privacy technical and sustainability
considerations and involves a data scientist expert in ML, is conducted by Multiversity every time a new AI
initiative is launched. For example, Multiversity monitors potential risks that may arise from the use of AI in
education, including education products and services being replaced by AI solutions, risks associated with data
breach and the entry of additional players in the education market enabled by lower production costs as a result
of increased use of AI. AI and ML may produce unpredictable or harmful outcomes and there may be
unforeseen risks associated with AI and ML. In addition to any technical challenges that such technologies may
provide, the ability to provide data-driven insights may be constrained by current or future regulatory
requirements, privacy and intellectual property laws or ethical considerations that could restrict or impose
burdensome and costly requirements on Multiversity’s ability to leverage data in useful and innovative ways.
Furthermore, the scope, enforcement and application of AI laws and regulations may not be clear and may be
applied to Multiversity’s business in ways it does not anticipate. Multiversity’s uses of AI may be subject to
investigations, complaints, enforcement actions, penalties and litigation, and compliance with new AI regulatory
requirements may result in increased expenses and administrative obligations. Multiversity’s failure to


-----

adequately address current or future technical, ethical, legal, privacy or social issues that may arise with such
technologies and use cases, failure by others in our industry, or actions taken by Multiversity’s students,
employees, or other third parties or end users (including misuse of these technologies), could negatively affect
the adoption of our solutions and subject us to reputational harm, regulatory action or legal liability, which may
harm Multiversity’s financial condition and operating results. In addition, Multiversity’s competitive position
could be impacted if it is unable to deploy, in a cost effective and competitive manner, technology that reduces
the dependency on live human interaction, or is capable of collecting and analyzing a wide variety of data to
help enhance the student experience and the educational offering. Multiversity’s competitive position may also
be impacted if its competitors are better able to leverage AI and ML.

**_If Multiversity fails to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information_**
**_security or if new laws in these areas are enacted, Multiversity could face claims or penalties, which could_**
**_adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations._**

In the conduct of its business, Multiversity collects, uses, transmits and stores data in its IT systems. This data
includes confidential information such as confidential exam content or information belonging to it, its students
and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of individuals, including employees.
Multiversity’s operations are based in Europe, and are therefore subject to the European General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR provides for stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection of
personal data, and any failure to comply with it could subject Multiversity to significant monetary forfeitures
and other penalties. In particular, Multiversity’s online universities routinely process and retain sensitive
personal data, including specific information regarding individuals’ ethnicity, gender and disability information
or information regarding student performance. The processing and storage of such information is highly
regulated under GDPR and other applicable privacy regimes, and any mishandling of this data could subject
Multiversity to significant regulatory penalties or civil liabilities. As such, any breach in data privacy protection
regulations could have a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business and could lead to a negative
reputational impact. In addition, if the security measures Multiversity uses to protect personal data are
ineffective due to a systems failure or other reasons (including ones not caused by Multiversity), Multiversity
could be subject to liability, including for breach of data protection legislation, claims of invasion of privacy,
impersonation, unauthorized purchases or other claims. It is also possible that Multiversity’s employees could,
fraudulently or otherwise, misuse personal data and Multiversity would be liable for such misuse.

If Multiversity does not maintain suitable controls and processes that comply with the GDPR, its ability to
attract and retain students may be adversely impacted, its reputation may deteriorate and its business, prospects,
results of operations, cash flow and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.

Multiversity could also incur significant expenses in connection with remedying any potential security breaches,
by either settling any resulting claims against Multiversity, defending itself in court or administrative
proceedings and putting in place additional measures in order to further protect itself from the threat of these
breaches. In addition, any failure to protect personal information may adversely impact Multiversity’s ability to
attract and retain students, cause its reputation to deteriorate and materially and adversely affect its business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

As further described in the section “Regulation”, Multiversity is subject to extensive regulation and supervision
in a variety of areas including those related to privacy, data protection and information security, which is
continuously evolving. In this respect, for example, Multiversity replaced the fingerprint-based attendance
system for employees (in use for Pegaso’s employees) with an app-based system, effective from May 1, 2024.
New regulations and guidelines are introduced relatively frequently. Any changes in the regulatory framework,
in how regulations are applied, or any further implementation of new requirements for private companies
providing online education services may have a detrimental effect on the business and operations of
Multiversity.

**_If Multiversity is unable to protect its intellectual property, or if it infringes on the intellectual property of_**
**_third parties, its business could be affected._**

Multiversity’s trademarks, patents, copyright and other intellectual property rights distinguish its universities
and the services they provide from those of its competitors and are critical to Multiversity’s ability to continue
to develop and enhance its brand. In particular, Multiversity relies on trademark protection in Italy and
worldwide to protect its rights to the trademark ‘Pegaso’ and ‘EIPASS’, among others, and its distinctive logos
and other marks associated with its programs and services. It has registered 101 domain names and 25


-----

trademarks, as well as the algorithm underlying its IT platform’s flowchart, among other software registrations
(see “Business—Intellectual Property” for further information). Moreover, in the ordinary course of its business,
Multiversity develops intellectual property of many kinds, also in collaboration with its commercial partners,
that is or will be the subject of copyright or other protections. Such intellectual property includes but is not
limited to didactic and research materials and business know-how, as well as its e-learning platform which has
been developed by it entirely in-house.

There is no guarantee that third parties (including its commercial and academic business partners) will not in the
future infringe or misappropriate its trademarks, brand names or other intellectual property, and that any present
or future measures enacted by Multiversity to protect its intellectual property and enforce its rights are or will be
sufficient. Furthermore, Multiversity also may be involved in disputes from time to time over rights and
obligations concerning certain other intellectual property that it utilizes, and Multiversity may not prevail in
these disputes which may also incur significant costs for the company. Third parties may bring claims against
Multiversity alleging infringement or violation of their intellectual property. Multiversity might face penalties
and charges if found liable for any infringements or might be required to comply with injunctions against it to
prevent further infringement. Some third-party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad and it may
not be possible for Multiversity to conduct its operations in such a way as to avoid infringement of those
intellectual property rights. Any claims of infringement or alleged infringement of intellectual property rights
could negatively impact Multiversity’s reputation and branding, which could have a material adverse effect on
its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Policing the unauthorized use or theft of Multiversity’s trademarks, brand name know-how and technology is
complex and costly, and a litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect such intellectual property rights or to
determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The outcome of such potential litigation may
not always be in favor of Multiversity and, even in the event of a successful outcome, the remedies may not be
sufficient able to adequately protect its rights.

**_If Multiversity is unable to attract and retain its faculty, administrators and skilled personnel, it may not be_**
**_able to support its growth strategy and deliver updated programs._**

Multiversity must attract and retain highly qualified (and, in some cases, high profile) faculty, administrators, IT
specialists and other skilled personnel to implement its growth strategy and deliver up-to-date programs, along
with maintaining quality of instruction.

If Multiversity fails to attract new skilled personnel or faculty or fails to retain and motivate its existing faculty,
administrators, and skilled personnel, it may have to withdraw certain programs and may experience a reduction
in student enrollment which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations.
Additionally, a possible increase in the turnover rate could adversely affect its ability to attract and recruit
sufficient staff in key areas which could affect the quality and consistency of the curricula, in turn affecting
students’ academic performance as well as the brand and reputation of its educational institutions.

In addition, as Multiversity continues to expand and add personnel, it may face additional difficulty in
maintaining consistency in the quality of the teaching staff that it recruits. A shortage of quality teaching
personnel and a high turnover rate of staff could lead to ineffective delivery of the curricula offered to students,
impacting their academic performance and Multiversity’s reputation. If Multiversity is unable to, or is perceived
to be unable to, attract and retain qualified and effective teachers, principals, school administrators and support
staff, its business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition may be materially and
adversely affected.

**_Demand for Multiversity’s services is affected by employment demand, including by the Italian public_**
**_administration._**

Demand for Multiversity’s services is affected by the Italian employment market as students of Multiversity’s
institutions tend to enroll in a particular course in periods when there are or are expected to be significant
employment opportunities in the relevant sector that they are looking to achieve a qualification in. Similarly,
scarce employment opportunities in particular industry sectors might adversely affect the number of students
pursuing relevant qualifications. See “Business—Enrollment, Student Demographics and Performance by
_Entity” for further information on enrollment figures for the 2022/2023 academic year._


-----

Accordingly, should employment opportunities decrease in the Italian job market or, more specifically, should
the Italian public administration fail to launch tender procedures periodically or with the expected frequency
(usually every two years), or should such tenders require the recruitment of less personnel than expected,
demand for Multiversity’s programs and services could decline, thereby materially and adversely affecting
Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_If Multiversity fails to enroll new students and re-enroll existing students, its financial performance may_**
**_suffer._**

Increasing enrollments in the courses offered by Multiversity’s educational institutions is critical to
Multiversity’s financial performance. The online education market has shown constant growth in Italy since the
2015/2016 academic year. See “Industry—The Italian higher education market has historically demonstrated
_stable growth which in recent years has been accelerated by online enrollments, yet graduate penetration is still_
_well below other nations in Europe due to a number of structural challenges.”_ In line with this trend, the
number of students enrolled in Pegaso’s, Mercatorum’s and San Raffaele’s undergraduate degree courses for the
2022/2023 academic year increased by approximately 28% with respect to the previous academic year. See
“Business—Offering” and “Business—Enrollment, Student Demographics and Performance by Entity” for
further details on the number of students enrolled in Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele. However, although
Multiversity has experienced year-on-year student enrollment growth since 2015, there can be no assurance that
enrollment will continue to grow or be maintained at current levels in the future.

If Multiversity is unable to secure new students through its marketing and recruitment efforts, or fails to expand
its educational offering, it may be unable to maintain and/or increase enrollment rates at its universities. A high
volume of Pegaso’s, Mercatorum’s and San Raffaele’s students benefit from preferential rates which are lower
than the full-priced tuition fees. Such students, are entitled to preferential rates pursuant to certain agreements
that such institutions have entered into with private companies as well as public bodies, in order to provide their
employees (and in some cases their related parties) with more favorable rates and thereby incentivizing such
employees to, for example, attend courses in order to accelerate their career paths or to comply with the ongoing
professional development requirements set up by regulators or employers. Pegaso, Mercatorum and San
Raffaele together have in place over 1,000 agreements securing captive customers which provide for the
application of preferential rates for undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses (see “Business—Tuition
_Fees—Preferential and corporate rates”). Should a proportion of such agreements be terminated or not be_
renewed, Multiversity would be unable to offer the same competitive rates to certain categories of students who
may choose to enroll at a competitor as a result, thereby impacting Multiversity’s ability to maintain the current
enrollment rates at its universities.

In addition, if Multiversity’s institutions fail to maintain or enhance the quality of education they offer or change
their current offering, students may choose not to re-enroll or may decide to drop out of university. If
Multiversity is unable to recruit or retain students in its universities, its business, prospects, results of operations,
cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

**_As Multiversity is an online provider of education, it is substantially dependent on continued growth and_**
**_acceptance of online education and, if recognition by students and employers of the value of online education_**
**_does not continue to grow, its ability to grow its business could be adversely impacted._**

Continued growth in online education is expected to be largely dependent on new students and employers
recognizing the value of degrees and courses obtained from online institutions. If students and employers are not
convinced that an online education provides necessary value, or if growth in the market penetration of online
education slows, growth in the industry and, consequently, Multiversity’s business, could be adversely affected.
Because Multiversity’s business model is based solely on online education and distance learning, if acceptance
of online education does not continue to grow, its ability to expand its business and increases its revenues yearon- year, its results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

**_If Multiversity loses key management personnel, its business could be adversely affected._**

Multiversity’s success depends, in part, on its ability to attract and retain key management personnel. If its
officers, managers and department heads are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions for any
reason, Multiversity may not be able to replace them easily or at all. Loss of the services of experienced
management personnel may be disruptive and cause uncertainty. The process to replace these individuals would
involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of Multiversity’s


-----

business objectives. An inability to attract and retain qualified key management personnel in a timely manner
could have a material and adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, prospects, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Any negative impact on the reputation of Multiversity’s institutions and sector could adversely affect its_**
**_business._**

Multiversity is susceptible to reputational risks and may be negatively impacted by negative publicity. In
particular, Multiversity’s ability to attract and retain students depends largely on the academic reputation and
popularity of its universities. Factors which may negatively impact reputation and result in negative publicity
include:

- perceptions of students and regulators about the quality of curricula, teaching staff or program
facilities;

- accidents, criminal incidents or other events that adversely affect Multiversity’s employees or its
students, including in the locations in which Multiversity operates; and/or

- legal, fiscal, regulatory or compliance action which highlights concerns about Multiversity’s
operations.

If any of these or similar events occur, Multiversity could face regulatory or even criminal sanctions, loss of
authorizations, fines or other financial or reputational harm (including negative press). The occurrence of such
events may lead to a decline in new student enrollments and cancelation of enrollments and therefore could have
a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, the occurrence of an event affecting the reputation of one or more of Multiversity’s universities
could be associated with the brand of a specific university or, more broadly, with Multiversity as a whole and
could influence the way its programs are viewed, not only by potential students, but also by its partners,
regulators and other parties in the education sector and the general public. A reduction in the number of students
enrolled in Multiversity’s institutions or the inability to maintain or increase tuition fees and the variety of its
offering as a result of damage to the reputation of any one of Multiversity’s institutions or in the institutions of
Multiversity as a whole, could have an adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Multiversity’s ability to retain existing contracts with key personnel and to attract potential students is also
dependent on the maintenance of its reputation. Multiversity is vulnerable to adverse market perception as it
operates in an industry where a high level of integrity and trust is paramount. Inappropriate or illegal behaviour
of the members of the staff or students could occur and this might have bearing on the public perception of
Multiversity’s educational institutions. Any perceived, actual or alleged mismanagement, fraud or failure to
satisfy Multiversity’s responsibilities or negative publicity resulting from such activities or allegations of such
activities (whether founded or not) could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_Multiversity’s future growth and profitability is dependent upon the effectiveness of its marketing and_**
**_advertising efforts and brand reputation._**

Multiversity’s future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness of its marketing
and advertising strategy and brand reputation. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Multiversity
advertises its programs and services through social media and various online channels, as well as through
traditional marketing methods. See “Business—Student Orientation and Marketing and Sales” for further
details.

If Multiversity’s media performance is not effective in promoting program awareness or brand reputation, or if it
is not able to reach its target demographic, its future results of operations and financial condition may be
adversely affected.


-----

**_Changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations_**
**_and financial condition._**

Multiversity and its subsidiaries are subject to income and other taxes mainly in Italy in particular, changes in
Italian tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application could materially affect our tax expenses
and profitability.

Italian tax law and administration is complex and often requires us to make subjective determinations about
whether, and calculations about to what extent, we owe amounts to the relevant tax authorities. We often rely on
generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the
relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. We are from time to time subject
to tax audits and investigations by the tax authorities, which include investigations with respect to the direct tax
and indirect tax regime applicable to our transactions.

Future changes in tax laws, treaties, or regulations, and their interpretation or enforcement, may be
unpredictable, particularly as the taxing jurisdiction face an increasing number of political, budgetary and other
fiscal challenges. Tax rates in Italy may change as a result of macroeconomic and other factors outside of our
control, making it increasingly difficult for corporations like ourselves to operate with certainty about taxation.
As a result, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their
interpretation or enforcement), which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of
operations, and financial condition, as well as our effective income tax rate.

**_Multiversity and its subsidiaries, employees, management or agents may be subject to legal and tax_**
**_proceedings in the ordinary course of its business or otherwise._**

From time to time, Multiversity and its subsidiaries may also be party to legal or tax proceedings or
investigations by public authorities, arising in the ordinary course of its business or otherwise. Litigation can be
costly and time-consuming and divert management resources from business operations. In the event of an
adverse outcome, Multiversity and its subsidiaries could incur significant defense costs, be required to pay
damages and interest to the prevailing party and, depending on the jurisdiction of the litigation, be held
responsible for paying the costs of the prevailing party, or agree to settle. For example, in March 2023,
Multiversity entered into a settlement agreement with its former shareholder, Mr. Danilo Iervolino, relating to
the 2021 Acquisition and whereby Multiversity agreed to pay €2.0 million to its former shareholder. While the
dispute has been settled, there can be no assurance that no similar or other disputes may arise in the future. In
addition, tax, judicial or other governmental authorities may impose significant fines or other measures
(including, inter alia, operational bans) if they conclude that Multiversity and its subsidiaries’ operations have
not been conducted in accordance with applicable legislation, regulations, rules or best practice guidelines or
certain specific corporate compliance requirements, such as the obligation to have in place organizational and
internal monitoring systems (including an internal control model pursuant to the Italian Legislative Decree no.
231 of June 8, 2001 (“Decree 231”).

Additionally, the Group’s employees, suppliers, subcontractors or other business partners may fail to comply
with the strict requirements to which they are subject to or with the regulations in force. Although the Group has
implemented policies and trainings to ensure compliance with applicable sanction, anti-bribery and
anticorruption laws, including those related to sanctioned countries and individuals, it cannot be excluded that
certain of Group’s sales may be made and services may be offered in violation of such legislation and
regulations. Violations of such laws can result in civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges,
injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts, revocations
or restrictions of licenses, criminal fines or imprisonment. In addition, such violations could also negatively
impact the Group’s reputation and, consequently, our ability to attract student enrollment. On the other hand,
any such violation by the Group’s competitors, if undetected, could give them an unfair competitive advantage.
The consequences that the Group may suffer due to the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on its
business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

Furthermore, certain of our current and former employees and members of senior management (including in
their past capacities at other companies) have been, are or may become subject to certain legal, regulatory,
criminal or tax investigations or proceedings. These could be related, among others, to bribery, fraud and
similar allegations. However, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, none of such claims, investigations
and proceedings have resulted in any final and binding decision that may have a material adverse impact on the
Group, and no investigations or proceedings under the 231 Decree have been brought against any company of


-----

the Group. We have adopted certain internal compliance policies and procedures as part of strengthening our
structure and risk management policies; however, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective in
preventing every possible claim or that no claims will be filed in the future. As a result, the involvement or
association of our employees, managers or agents with fraud, bribery or other relevant violations, criminal
convictions or allegations or rumors relating thereto, even in their past capacities at other companies, could have
a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

For details of the legal or tax proceedings to which Multiversity, any member of the Group and its employees
are subject, see “Business—Litigation and legal, tax and administrative proceedings.”

**_We may incur liabilities for the actions of our directors, employees, third parties, representatives, advisors_**
**_and intermediaries including under Legislative Decree 231/2001._**

Conducting the Group’s business in an ethically acceptable manner is important to our reputation, status with
regulators and our customers, and business prospects. The Group faces a number of risks related to compliance
with applicable law, which may be due to its employee’s activities or omissions and which may constitute
criminal conduct in certain circumstances. In particular, the Group is exposed to the risk of sanctions under
Decree 231, which provides for the liability of companies as a consequence of certain crimes committed in the
interest of and to the advantage of such company by people responsible for representing, directing or managing,
or by people who de facto manage and control, such company or one of its business units that has financial and
operational autonomy, as well as by anyone who is subject to the management or supervision of one of the
aforementioned people.

In particular, pursuant to Decree 231, the Group may be held responsible for certain crimes committed in Italy
or abroad including, among others, bribery, money laundering, corruption (including among private
individuals), fraud against the state, corporate offenses, market abuse, certain tax violations, certain
environmental violations and manslaughter or serious injury depending from the violation of health and safety
regulations at the workplace in its interest or for its benefit, by individuals having a functional relationship with
the Group at the time the relevant crime was committed. In such circumstances, the Group may be subject to
fines, confiscation of profits or benefits deriving from the offence or disqualification measures (which might be
also applied as interim measures since the investigation phase), including, subject to certain conditions being
met, the termination of authorization, permits, licenses, concessions and financing arrangements, including
facilitated financing, suspension of our operations, or prohibitions on contracting with public authorities. Any of
the foregoing events may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, cash flow, results of
operations, financial condition and reputation.

When the crime is committed by the senior management, the company may avoid liability if, in addition to
having adopted and implemented the model of organization, management and control (“Model 231”), it can
prove that the offence was committed by fraudulently circumventing Model 231. When the crime is committed
by the persons under the management or supervision of one of the senior managers, the company can avoid
liability if, prior to commission of the offence, Model 231 was adopted and efficiently implemented.

Decree 231 also provides that the company is exempted from liability if it can prove that it has adopted and
effectively implemented a Model 231 capable of preventing the commission of the covered offenses and
entrusted to a supervisory committee the task of supervising the functioning and observance of such model.
While Multiversity, Pegaso, Mercatorum, Unimercatorum S.r.l., San Raffaele, Aulab and Certipass have already
adopted a Model 231 and appointed a supervisory committee, some of this Model 231 needs to be updated in
order to reflect the new legislation impacting on Decree 231. Sole 24 Ore Formazione and Principe di Napoli are
in the process of approving a Model 231 as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, certain other non-material
companies of the Group (such as Pegaso International, Giapeto Editore S.r.l., Benecon S.c.a.r.l., Pegaso
Management S.r.l., Uniglobal Ltd. and 3D Civil Engineering Lab S.r.l.) have not yet adopted a Model 231.

However, adoption of Model 231 does not in itself exclude the applicability of the sanctions provided for in the
Decree 231. In the event of an offense covered by the Decree 231, the judicial authority is called upon to
evaluate the model adopted and its implementation. If the judicial authority considers that the adopted model
was not suitable for preventing such offense, if the model had not been effectively implemented or if there had
been insufficient supervision of and compliance with the model, the company would still be subject to liability
and sanctions. Any of these liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.


-----

**_Labor disputes and other labor matters could lead to loss of revenues or higher costs._**

Our Group is subject to a number of collective bargaining agreements (“CCNL”) in Italy. In general, the
CCNLs include terms that regulate remuneration, minimum salary, salary complements, extra time, benefits,
bonuses and partial disability. The employment agreements entered into with non-executive employees are
governed by the CCNL for employees of the commercial sector (“CCNL per le aziende del terziario,
_distribuzione e servizi”) while the employment agreements entered into with executive employees are governed_
by the CCNL for executives of the commercial sector (“CCNL per i Dirigenti di aziende del terziario, della
_distribuzione e dei servizi”)._

There can be no assurance that the Instituto Nazionale di Previdenza Sociale (“INPS”) and employees of the
Group will not file any claim regarding the payment of salaries and social security differences, due to the change
of the CCNL which occurred in the last two years within certain Companies of the Group.

While we believe that the Group has good relations with trade unions and employees generally, there can be no
assurance that these relations will not deteriorate and that we will not experience labor disputes in the future.
Any failure to extend or renegotiate our CCNLs on terms favorable to the Group, or any increase in labor costs
due to competition, increased minimum wage, employee benefit costs, medical benefits costs, work stoppages or
otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business. Additionally, the right to go on strike is
provided for under Italian law, although the Group has historically never experienced general strikes called by
trade unions. We cannot guarantee that the employees of the Group will not go on strike in the future, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.
Moreover, future negotiations with unions or works councils in connection with existing labor agreements may
result in significant increases in our cost of labor, divert management’s attention away from operating our
business, disrupt the Group’s services, damage its reputation, adversely affect its customer relations or break
down and disrupt operations. Works council and CCNLs may impose obligations and restrictions on the Group
that may adversely affect its flexibility to undertake adjustments to its workforce, restructurings, reorganizations
and similar corporate actions. Although the Group has not experienced any material collective labor disputes in
the past, there can be no assurance that labor disputes will not arise in the future. Any of the preceding outcomes
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, cash flow, results of operations and financial
condition.

Finally, it cannot be excluded that other claims may be filed by fixed-term employees employed by the Group
requesting the establishment of an open-ended relationship or by academic/non-academic individuals working
for the Group under self-employment agreements claiming to be reclassified as subordinate employees.

**_Multiversity relies on third parties to provide certain services, mainly related to providing information and_**
**_orientation or certifications to new students. If Multiversity is not able to manage this third parties’ network it_**
**_could face a decrease of the new enrollments._**

Multiversity relies on its network of approximately 1,000 ELCPs located throughout Italy to run certain
activities. Approximately 61% of new students at Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele are oriented and trained
by the ELCPs, with certain ELCPs accredited by more than one Multiversity institution. In the case of Certipass,
its ELCPs are authorised to provide EIPASS Certifications and related services. See “Business—Presence and
_Property” for further details. Although Multiversity has entered into specific accreditation agreements with all_
of the ELCPs managing these activities, they remain independent third-party providers and there is no guarantee
that they will at all times operate in line with Multiversity’s expectations or requirements or that they will not
breach the terms of the relevant accreditation agreement, resulting in Multiversity terminating the contractual
relationship. Furthermore, ELCPs’ actions could be at times contrary to Multiversity’s policies, potentially
resulting in reputational damages for Multiversity which might impact Multiversity’s perception among
prospective students and the number of students seeking enrollment.

In addition, should Multiversity be unable to continue to secure the services of these or other third parties
(through increased competition or for other reasons) its ability to provide orientation or certification services to
students across the territory could be significantly impacted which might lead to a decrease in new enrollments.

**_Any change in the timing of tuition fee payments could create cash flow issues for Multiversity._**

Payment of tuition fees for undergraduate courses and academic master’s degrees are generally due in four or
eight equal installments in each academic year, whereas tuition fees for postgraduate courses are generally


-----

payable in a single lump-sum payment or up to four equal installments over the academic year, although
Multiversity may change the timing of tuition fee payments in the future based on commercial considerations.

The timing of the incurrence of expenses by Multiversity may, however, not necessarily correspond to this
pattern. If Multiversity were to be required by regulation or as a result of market conditions to collect its fees
after courses have been completed by the student, this could have an adverse effect on its cash flows.

**_Failure to support and integrate ESG sustainability principles, guidelines and initiatives into our business_**
**_strategy and practices, or failure to meet our ESG objectives and goals, may adversely affect our business._**

Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) considerations are becoming increasingly important to various
stakeholders and market participants and are increasingly taken into account in business and commercial
decision-making. As such, if we do not actively support and integrate ESG sustainability principles, guidelines
and initiatives into our business strategy and practices or comply with applicable laws and regulations in respect
thereof, our business may be adversely affected. The negative impact may materialize as, amongst others, loss
of reputation in the market, stakeholder activism and campaigns, loss of students, vendors, or service providers
to more ESG-conscious competitors, sanction proceedings by authorities and claims by third parties before
courts or difficulties in raising financing.

In addition to our compliance with relevant laws and regulations in relation to ESG and sustainability, including
our preparations to ensure we comply, starting from 2026, with Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of December 14, 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive
2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting
(the “EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive” or the “CSRD”), we have approved an ESG strategic
plan in June 2023 based on five pillars (i) innovative, accessible and quality education, (ii) a healthy work
environment that promotes inclusion and diversity, (iii) protection of our planet, (iv) community engagement,
and (v) good governance.

If we fail to comply with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations in respect of sustainability and
climate resilience, to set the appropriate ESG strategy or to meet the objectives and the goals set by such
strategy, we may face adverse consequences to our business, such as those described above.

Failure to support and integrate ESG sustainability principles, guidelines and initiatives into our business
strategy and practices, failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations in respect of
sustainability and climate resilience, including the CSRD, or failure to meet the objectives and the goals set by
our CSR strategic framework, could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results
of operations, and financial condition.

**_We present information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Annualized run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and other_**
**_non-GAAP measures in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information_**
**_was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on_**
**_them._**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain statements and figures relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Annualized
run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. These measures may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under Italian GAAP, IFRS standards or
other generally accepted accounting principles. The non-GAAP measures are not measurements of our
performance or liquidity under Italian GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or
profit from ordinary operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with Italian GAAP or
as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. Annualized run-rate Adjusted
EBITDA and other metrics calculated using Annualized run-rate Adjusted EBITDA mainly include adjustments
for the estimated run-rate effect from an increase in undergraduate student enrollments and undergraduate
tuition fees for the 2023/2024 academic year compared to the prior academic year, as adjusted by applying the
Group’s historical churn rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as
certain other adjustments for the annualization of digital marketing costs, IT developments and the estimated
run-rate effect of completed acquisitions. See “Summary Financial and Other Information—As Adjusted Pro
_Forma Information” for further details. We calculated such figures based on unaudited financial information or_
management schedules, which required significant assumptions and estimates and may not be up to date or may
not be prepared on the same basis on which we prepare our audited accounts. Such information does not reflect
any accounting or pro forma adjustments that may be required to present consolidated financial information.


-----

This adjustment is for illustrative purposes only. While we believe these estimates and assumptions to be
reasonable, some or all of this information may prove to be inaccurate or incomplete. As a result, you should not
unduly rely on such information in making an investment in the Notes.

**Risks Related to the Acquisition**

**_The Group’s historical financial information may not be representative of future results._**

The Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum have not been
adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the statement of profit or loss, statements of financial position or
statement of cash flows that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result
of the Acquisition. However, we will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting
under Italian GAAP and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the
financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of
purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and liabilities and we may add
additional assets to our statement of financial position, which may include, inter alia, intangible assets, such as
goodwill, which are not required to be amortized in accordance with applicable Italian GAAP. We may also
recognize different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our
consolidated financial statements for periods after the Acquisition Closing Date could be materially different
once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
this Offering Memorandum.

**_The Group may have liabilities that are not known or greater than anticipated._**

Before making investments, the Issuer and its shareholders conduct due diligence that they deem reasonable and
appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. The objective of the due
diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances of an
investment, to identify possible risks associated with that investment and to prepare a framework that may be
used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. Nevertheless, when
conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Issuer and its shareholders
rely on resources available to them, including information provided by the Group and, in some circumstances,
third-party investigations.

The Issuer cannot be certain that its due diligence investigation has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts
(including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary or helpful
in evaluating the merits of investing in the Group. Furthermore, the Group’s business and industry is subject to
various risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position,
results of operations and prospects. See “—Risks Related to the Group’s Business and Industry.” In particular,
the Group has from time to time been involved in legal disputes, proceedings and similar matters, including,
among others, in connection with purchase price adjustments, termination of contractual arrangements and tax
matters with its former shareholder, which have been settled. See “—Risks Related to the Group’s Business and
_Industry—Multiversity and its subsidiaries, employees, management or agents may be subject to legal and tax_
_proceedings in the ordinary course of its business or otherwise.” Following the Acquisition Closing Date, the_
Issuer may become subject to, or be held liable for similar matters. If the due diligence investigation failed to
identify material information regarding the Group, the Issuer may later be forced to write down or write off
certain assets, significantly modify the business plan or incur impairment or other charges.

**_The Issuer may not be able to enforce claims with respect to the representations and warranties that the_**
**_Seller has provided to the Issuer under the Acquisition Agreement._**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Seller has provided certain limited representations and warranties under
the Acquisition Agreement. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to enforce such claims against
the Seller relating to breaches of such representations and warranties. The Seller’s liability with respect to
breaches of their representations and warranties under the Acquisition Agreement is limited and is subject to
other restrictions as specified therein. The Issuer has entered into a warranty and indemnity insurance policy to
cover possible breaches of representations and warranties from the Sellers. However, there can be no assurance
that attempts to recover from the Seller or the insurance company under the insurance policy on breaches of
representations and warranties will be successful and if amounts are recovered, they may be inadequate to cover
any losses or damages resulting from the Seller’s breach. Moreover, even if the Issuer ultimately succeeds in


-----

recovering any amounts from the Seller or the Issuer’s insurance provider, the Issuer may temporarily be
required to bear these losses itself.

**_The Acquisition may entitle the Group’s regulators, suppliers or other business partners of the Group to_**
**_terminate their agreements as a result of change of ownership provisions._**

The Acquisition may constitute a change of ownership under certain agreements entered into by members of the
Group and the counterparties to such agreements may be entitled to terminate their agreements with such
members of the Group as a result. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights.
Alternatively, some of these counterparties may seek to renegotiate their contracts with us to obtain more
favorable terms. Under some of the Target’s institutions’ licenses, public authorities impose restrictions on the
transfers of the ownership of the license holder, including a change of ownership clause, which prohibits the
transfer of the ownership of the license holder without the prior approval of the authority. While we have not
experienced any material issues as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, if there are any such termination
rights and the Group is unable to obtain relevant waivers or consents or renegotiate the contracts, we may lose
some of these agreements or relevant licenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_The Issuer has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant costs in connection with the_**
**_Transactions._**

In connection with the Transactions, the Issuer has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs
and expenses, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses,
reorganization and restructuring costs, severance and employee benefit-related expenses and other related
charges. In addition, the Issuer may incur significant one-time charges as a result of costs associated with the
Transactions. The Issuer will not be able to quantify the exact amount of these charges or the period in which
they will be incurred until after the Transactions have been fully implemented. While it has assumed that a
certain level of expenses will be incurred in connection with the Transactions, there are many factors that could
affect the total amount or timing of the integration and implementation of these expenses. There may also be
additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the Transactions that we do not anticipate and may
not be able to recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and income we expect to achieve from
the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Risks Related to the Group’s Capital Structure**

**_The substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect the Group’s business,_**
**_financial position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes._**

Upon consummation of the Acquisition, we will be highly leveraged and will have significant debt service
obligations. As of December 31, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the principal amount of
our financial indebtedness would have been €1,866.2 million, consisting of indebtedness under the Notes and
the Existing Notes and amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization,” “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” We anticipate that our high leverage will_
continue for the foreseeable future and could have material consequences.

Our leverage could have important consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes, the Existing Notes,
the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt and liabilities we may be permitted to incur;

- increasing the vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic and industry conditions;

- increasing the exposure to interest rate increases because the Existing Notes, the Floating Rate Notes
and the Revolving Credit Facility each bear a floating rate of interest;

- limiting the Issuer and its subsidiaries’ ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working
capital requirements, capital expenditures, business opportunities and other corporate requirements and
increasing the costs of such additional financings;


-----

- placing the Group at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt in
relation to cash flow;

- requiring the Group to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund our
operations and for other corporate purposes;

- limiting the flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, competitive environment
and industry;

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on the ability to satisfy its
debt obligations, including under the Notes, the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt and
liabilities we may be permitted to incur.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult to service our debt, including_**
**_the Notes, and impair the ability to operate our business._**

Despite its substantial leverage, the Group may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including under
the Revolving Credit Facility. The Indenture and the Existing Indenture also permit the incurrence of additional
debt thereunder. Although the Existing Indenture contains and the Indenture will contain restrictions on the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and
exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance
with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, any such debt that is incurred by our subsidiaries that do
not guarantee the Notes (including, prior to the earlier of the implementation of the Post-Closing Reorganization
and the Guarantee of the Notes by the Target, the Existing Notes) will be structurally senior to our obligations
under the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Capital Structure—We may be unable to
_complete the Post-Closing Reorganization within the anticipated timeframe, or at all” and “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Notes will be structurally_
_subordinated to all indebtedness of the Issuer’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes,_
_including the Existing Notes, prior to the Guarantee of the Notes by the Target.”_

In connection with the Group’s financial strategy, it continually evaluates different financing alternatives, and
may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from
time to time. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at the Group’s election, and if such debt is in
the form of securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering
document. The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or
incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable to the Notes and our
other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced, which would have a
corresponding effect on our cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of any
such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later than
the maturity date of the Notes and our other existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would be as
agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the
Notes or our other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will elect to raise any such
additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the
timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If new debt is added to
our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Indenture will not
prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness thereunder. Our inability to service our
debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability
to fulfil our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that may limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

Restrictive covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indenture and the Indenture
may restrict our ability to operate our business. The Group’s failure to comply with these covenants, including
as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially adversely affect
our financial condition and results of operations. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing
Indenture contain and the Indenture will contain negative covenants restricting, among other things, our ability
to:

- make certain loans or investments;


-----

- incur indebtedness or issue guarantees;

- sell, lease, transfer or dispose of assets and subsidiary stock;

- merge or consolidate with other companies;

- pay dividends and make other restricted payments;

- create or incur liens;

- agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions;

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

Such restrictions could affect the Group’s ability to operate its business and may limit its ability to react to
market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such
restrictions could materially adversely affect the ability to finance its operations, make strategic acquisitions,
investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance capital needs, if any. Additionally, the ability to
comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond the Group’s control, including
prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.

In addition, prior to the Post-Closing Reorganization, the “restricted payments” restrictions in the Indenture
governing the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility will restrict the ability of the Target and its
subsidiaries to move cash to the Issuer in the form of dividends, intercompany loans or otherwise. Although the
Existing Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility include various exceptions to such restrictions, the
restrictions, may, nevertheless, limit the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes.
Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries (including, prior to the Post-Closing
Reorganization, the Target) are permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity, or may even
prevent such payments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes
_Guarantees—The Issuer will be dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to make_
_payments on the Notes.”_

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes.” The covenants to which we will be subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and_
capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to_**
**_generate or raise sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our obligations
under the Existing Notes and our obligations under the Notes, or to refinance our debt and to fund our ongoing
operations, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which is subject to general
economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, discussed in these “Risk
_Factors,” many of which are beyond our control._

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to
us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Existing Notes and
the Revolving Credit Facility. At the maturity of the Existing Notes on October 30, 2028 and the Revolving
Credit Facility, which matures six months before the Notes, the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, we


-----

may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness if we do not have sufficient cash flows from
operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt
obligations or meet other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If we
are unable to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing or
restructuring on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to, among others:

- reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditure;

- sell assets;

- raise additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations,
which could cause an event of default under our debt and the holders of our debt may be able to accelerate our
debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. The type, timing and terms of any future
financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the
prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of
these measures in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not
have sufficient cash or sources of cash to repay all of our debt. In addition, the terms of the Existing Indenture,
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement may limit our ability to
pursue any of these measures. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us
to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and
results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets, which we could be required to dispose of could
be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be
acceptable. Furthermore, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness
on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could impact our ability to incur
additional indebtedness in the future.

**_If the Acquisition does not occur on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will be required to_**
**_redeem its Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes and the Escrowed_**
**_Property may not be sufficient to cover the special mandatory redemption price._**

The gross proceeds from the Offering will be held in the Escrow Account pending the satisfaction of certain
conditions, some of which are outside of our control. If the Acquisition does not occur on or prior to the Escrow
Longstop Date or if certain other conditions are not satisfied, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption as described in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”
and you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on the Notes. Upon such redemption, you may not be
able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, if
you purchase the Notes at a price greater than the issue price of the Notes, you may suffer a loss on your
investment.

The Escrow Charge will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of
the Trustee. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have a direct security interest and will not be
entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Escrow Charge securing the Notes, except through the
Trustee. In addition, although the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, will be granted firstpriority liens on the applicable funds in the Escrow Account, the ability of holders of the Notes to realize such
funds may be subject to certain bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations in the event of the bankruptcy or
insolvency of the Issuer. As a result, holders of the Notes may not be able to have the escrow funds applied at
the time or in the manner contemplated by the Indenture and could suffer a loss as a result.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or financial
position of the Target Group or the terms of the Acquisition, between the Issue Date and the date of the release
of the Escrowed Property (if it occurs), or in the terms of the approvals or clearances (including regulatory
clearances) related to the Acquisition, may have an impact on our creditworthiness, and you will not be able to
rescind your decision to invest in the Notes as a result thereof.


-----

The Escrowed Property will be limited to the gross proceeds from this Offering, together with any earnings
thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest on
each series of Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption and there is no
assurance that the Issuer will have access to the funds necessary to allow it to pay the full amount of the required
special mandatory redemption price in the event of a special mandatory redemption. In the event that the special
mandatory redemption price payable upon such special mandatory redemption of the Notes exceeds the amount
of the applicable Escrowed Property, Holdco is expected to make an equity contribution to the Issuer to fund the
difference between the applicable special mandatory redemption price and the amount of the Escrowed Property
pursuant to a commitment provided by it. However, in the event such commitment is not honored, the Issuer
will not have sufficient funds to pay the special mandatory redemption price, and you may not obtain the return
you expect to receive on the Notes.

In the event that the consummation of the Acquisition is expected to occur on or about, and in any event, within
three business days of, the Issue Date, the gross proceeds of the Offering may be directly utilized by the Issuer
to, inter alia, complete the Acquisition as described in the section “Use of Proceeds” without being subject to
the escrow arrangements described in this Offering Memorandum and in addition, the Issuer will have three
business days following release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account to complete the
Acquisition, in which case, during such period such funds will not be subject to the Escrow Charge.

**_We may be unable to complete the Post-Closing Reorganization within the anticipated timeframe, or at all._**

Following the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
the Post-Closing Reorganization as a result of which the Issuer will merge into the Target under a reverse
merger (with the Target being the surviving entity) within 18 months following the Acquisition Closing Date,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles and any relevant approval and/or authorisation by any competent
authority.

Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code is the central provision in the Italian legislation regulating merger debt
push-downs (thus, its application constitutes a safe-harbor vis-à-vis the risk that any such merger can be
considered unlawful, also from a financial assistance perspective, with ensuing consequences). In order to
complete the Post-Closing Reorganization, there are various steps that we must take, including the preparation
of merger plans, reports by the directors of the Issuer and the Target (relazione dell’organo amministrativo) and
reports by an independent expert appointed by the court, assessing the sustainability of debt at the level of
Multiversity. Furthermore, Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code is also based on the premise that the
merger follows an acquisition of control of the Target by another entity.

Our estimation of the time frame required to complete the Post-Closing Reorganization is based upon market
practice for leveraged buyouts in Italy, which typically involve acquisition vehicles in the form of joint stock
companies (società per azioni) where an independent expert is required to be appointed by the court, which
creates an inherent uncertainty as to the length of time in which the Post-Closing Reorganization can be
expected to take place. In addition, there can be no assurance that the independent expert will release its report
or that the other steps required for the Post-Closing Reorganization will be taken in a timely manner, or at all.
Subject to certain exceptions, the Post-Completion Reorganization can only be implemented following the
expiration of 60 days after the latest filing with the competent companies’ registry of the resolutions approving
the Post Completion Reorganization. Within this 60-day deadline, the creditors of the companies involved in the
Post Completion Reorganization are entitled to challenge the Post-Completion Reorganization.

In the event that the Post-Closing Reorganization does not occur (and no Upstream Guarantee is granted by the
Target), the Issuer, a holding company with no material assets, other than its shareholder in the Target or
liabilities, other than the Notes and no revenue generating operations, will be dependent on distributions or
payments from its subsidiaries (including the Target) to meet its obligations under the Notes. Such subsidiaries
are restricted under the Existing Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement from moving cash to
the Issuer in the form of dividends, intercompany loans or otherwise, which may impact our ability to meet such
obligations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—
_The Issuer will be dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to make payments on the_
_Notes.”_


-----

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees**

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of the Issuer’s existing and future subsidiaries_**
**_that do not guarantee the Notes, including the Existing Notes, prior to the Guarantee of the Notes by the_**
**_Target._**

On the Issue Date and on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Following the
Acquisition Closing Date (as defined herein), the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Target to guarantee the Notes within 120 days following the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles and significant limitations under applicable laws (including the completion of the Whitewash
Procedure and the other limitations set out below). The Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes will
have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make any funds available
to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or otherwise. Accordingly, in the event that any
subsidiary of the Issuer that does not guarantee the Notes (including, prior to the Guarantee of the Notes by the
Target, the Target) becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other
than as part of a solvent transaction:

   - the creditors of the Issuer, including the holders of the Notes, will have no right to proceed against the
assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary; and

   - creditors of such subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any)
will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such
subsidiary before the Issuer, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to
receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the claims of creditors of our subsidiaries, including trade creditors and claims of preference
shareholders (if any), will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims
of the creditors of the Issuer, including claims by the holders of the Notes.

Prior to the earlier of the implementation of the Post-Closing Reorganization and the Guarantee of the Notes by
the Target, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Target, including the Existing
Notes and, in the event that the Target becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise
wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction during such time, the Issuer only has a shareholders claim
on the assets of the Target, its direct subsidiary. See “—Risks Related to the Group’s Capital Structure—We
_may be unable to complete the Post-Closing Reorganization within the anticipated timeframe, or at all” and “—_
_Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Notes will be structurally_
_subordinated to all indebtedness of the Issuer’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes,_
_including the Existing Notes, prior to the Guarantee of the Notes by the Target.”_

Subject to restrictions in the Indenture, the Existing Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, we
may incur additional indebtedness, including at the level of our subsidiaries. See “—We may incur substantially
_more debt in the future, which may make it difficult to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair the_
_ability to operate our business.”_

**_The Issuer is incorporated in Italy, and Italian insolvency laws may not be as favorable to holders of the_**
**_Notes as insolvency laws in other jurisdictions with which they may be familiar._**

The Issuer is organized and is likely to have its center of main interests under the laws of Italy. The insolvency
laws of Italy may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with
which you may be familiar, including in respect of creditors’ reorganization, priority of creditors, the ability to
obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to
recover payments due on the Notes to the extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.
In the event that the Issuer or any future subsidiary of the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the insolvency and other laws
of Italy may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of
secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors,
the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws could
call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to
enforce your rights against the Collateral in Italy and limit any amounts that you may receive. For an overview


-----

of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Issuer, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging liabilities and certain debt that we may incur_**
**_in the future will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in_**
**_priority to the Notes._**

In addition to securing the Notes, the assets that comprise the Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis
our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes and certain hedging obligations. The
Indenture, the Existing Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will also permit the Collateral to be pledged
to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement.
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging
obligations will have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an
enforcement action taken with respect to such Collateral. In the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may
not be able to recover on such Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility and
such amount in respect of such hedging obligations are greater than or equal to the proceeds realized. In
addition, any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under
the Revolving Credit Facility and such amount in respect of such hedging obligations have been discharged
from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by such
Collateral on a pari passu basis, including the Existing Notes, which obligations may be significant. In addition,
the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging counterparties may have interests that are
different from the interests of holders of the Notes, and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be
disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

**_The Notes will be effectively subordinated to additional indebtedness that the Group may incur to the extent_**
**_such debt is secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes. In addition, the proceeds from the_**
**_enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral and other secured indebtedness may
be secured by assets that do not secure the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Not all our assets
will secure the Notes and the Indenture allows the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain future
indebtedness permitted to be incurred with certain property and assets that do not secure the Notes. If an event
of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees
thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such other secured debt and will rank equally with the holders
of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets
excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. The claims of secured creditors that are secured by assets that
do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the
Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such
secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes will be secured by (a) on
or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer Share Pledge; and (b) within 10 Business Days following the
Acquisition Closing Date, the Target Share Pledge. Following the Acquisition Closing Date (and subject to the
accession of the Issuer, Holdco and the Trustee to the Intercreditor Agreement), the Collateral will secure the
liabilities under the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Collateral may also secure
additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving
Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may be
diluted by any increase in the first- priority debt secured by the Collateral. The Notes will be secured only to the
extent of the value of the Collateral. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an
enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the
Collateral in an orderly sale, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the condition of the Italian
economy and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of
realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the
Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, (i)
the pledges, shares and ownership interests of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an
insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding because all of the obligations of the entity must first be satisfied, leaving
little or no remaining assets in the entity and (ii) the total amount secured under the Collateral is not linked to
the market value of the underlying assets.


-----

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral, and an enforcement action may result in the_**
**_termination of licenses._**

The Collateral may be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted
under the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or
after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security
Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can
be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or
re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions (including the laws of Italy).

If the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, investors in
the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured
claim against the Issuer’s remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the
Collateral or any intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized
upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties
may be less than its value to Multiversity.

The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests
in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security
interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. In addition, the consents of any third
parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security
Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease.

The creation of security interest over the Collateral also does not prevent third-party creditors of the relevant
security provider from seeking attachment over the Collateral. In particular, third-party creditors may apply for
the Collateral to be sold under court supervised procedures. Although secured creditors under the Collateral will
have priority over the proceeds of the sale, the enforcement may not be in the best interests of the Holders at the
time.

Furthermore, enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Italy may be materially
more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be
familiar.

In addition, our business requires a variety of licenses. The continued operation of Multiversity depends on the
maintenance of such licenses. Under some of Multiversity’s institutions’ licenses, public authorities impose
restrictions on the transfers of the ownership of the license holder, including a change of control clause, which
prohibits the transfer of the ownership of the license holder without the prior approval of the authority. In the
event of an enforcement action under the terms of the Notes which resulted in the transfer of ownership of the
Issuer or its subsidiaries, or a change in the shareholding of the Multiversity for other reasons, the authorities
may attempt to cancel our licenses. In addition, the uncertainty concerning the transferability of such licenses
themselves could significantly reduce the value placed on the licenses by third parties and ultimately reduce the
amount recovered in the event of an enforcement action. The applicable governmental authorities may not
consent to the transfer of any of such licenses. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not
obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting
shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

**_The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the Collateral may be complicated,_**
**_involve long recovery times and a low recovery rate._**

In connection with the enforcement of pledge over shares of entities with outstanding debt obligations, any sale
of such entities is likely to involve a release of some or all of the debt of such entity, which could result in a
taxable capital gain to such entities. As the Notes will be issued by the Issuer, an enforcement over the shares of
the Issuer would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In
addition, the Indenture will not prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future.
Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the
Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce
the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value of the pledge over
the shares of the Issuer may be limited.

**_The Collateral, the Upstream Guarantee and any future guarantees or security of the Notes will be subject to_**
**_certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that_**
**_may limit their validity and enforceability._**

The Italian corporate benefit and financial assistance regulatory regime makes it unlikely that any subsidiaries of
the Target will guarantee and/or secure the Notes, while the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Target to guarantee the Notes within 120 days following the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and significant limitations under applicable laws (including the completion of the
Whitewash Procedure and the other limitations set out below). See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Italy—Whitewash_
_Procedure.”_

Our ability to procure the Upstream Guarantee is subject to certain material legal and procedural steps
(including the completion of the Whitewash Procedure) and contractual limitations, which may limit the value
of such Guarantee or result in us not being able to provide it at all. Moreover, the obligations of any future
guarantor (including the Target pursuant to the Upstream Guarantee) and/or security provider of the Notes (a
“Guarantor”), the enforcement of each of their Notes Guarantees and/or Collateral, the obligations of the
grantors of guarantee and/or security and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Notes Guarantee and/or
Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed and/or secured, as applicable, by such
Guarantor under the applicable laws of Italy, including a limitation to the extent that the granting of such
guarantee and/or security is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or otherwise would result in
violations of laws related to corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or
transactions under value. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” Accordingly, enforcement of any such Notes_
Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain defenses available to
Guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Notes Guarantees or
Collateral designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors.
These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable
preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization,
capital maintenance or similar laws and regulation or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a
result, the liability of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or
eliminated, depending on the amounts of its other obligations and the law applicable to it.

The Upstream Guarantee will be limited to the accrued profits and/or available reserves set aside for such
purpose in connection with the Whitewash Procedure and shall also be subject to the additional limitations set
out below. Pursuant to, and in order to comply with, the Whitewash Procedure that is envisaged to be
implemented by the Target, the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds
deriving from any enforcement of the Notes Guarantee issued by the Target shall not exceed the limit of the
relevant Target’s credit support approved pursuant to the Whitewash Procedure. See “Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—_
_Whitewash Procedure.”_

Furthermore, pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 2358 of the Italian Civil Code, the actual amount of credit
support to be provided by the Target under its Upstream Guarantee will be subject to, inter alia, the corporate
benefit analysis by the board of directors of the Target and will be determined by the directors on the basis of
several factors including, inter alia, the financial condition of the Target at the time of the Whitewash Procedure
and the availability of distributable profits and/or available reserves as of the date of the extraordinary
shareholders’ meeting approving the granting of such Upstream Guarantee. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the directors of the Target will resolve that the granting of the Notes Guarantee by it is in the
Target’s corporate interest and/or that there will be any distributable profits and/or available reserves and,
therefore, that the Upstream Guarantee expected to be provided by the Target will actually be granted. See also
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations—Italy—Whitewash Procedure.”_

In the event the Target grants its Upstream Guarantee, as a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law
with respect to, amongst others, financial assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary provided in the Notes, the Existing Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement:


-----

(i) the amount guaranteed by the Upstream Guarantee granted by the Target shall not exceed at any time
an amount equal to the lower of:

A. the amount of distributable profits and available reserves that will be set aside for such purposes
by the Target in connection with the Whitewash Procedure; and

B. the aggregate principal amount of as a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with
respect to, amongst others, financial assistance and corporate benefitas indicated below in respect
of any Italian Guarantor.

The enforceability of guarantees and/or security granted by virtue of the Whitewash Procedure has not been
tested before the Italian courts. In addition, to the extent losses are recorded by the Target at any time, any such
losses could reduce reserves relating to the credit support previously provided by the Target in connection with
the Whitewash Procedure; such losses could arise in the ordinary course of business or in connection with
contingent liabilities, and it has been held by prevailing legal analysis that losses will only erode any such
reserves after full impairment of other reserves and share capital.

Further, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or
guarantees which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the
application of Italian financial assistance and corporate benefit rules. Accordingly, in such circumstances you
would have no direct claim for payment against any such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party
with respect to any such additional collateral. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor or the
judicial receiver in the case of a judicial liquidation of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability
of the Notes Guarantee or Collateral on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may
determine that the Notes Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent such limitations
apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade
payables of such Guarantor to the extent of such limitations. Future security or guarantees may be subject to
similar limitations.

Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency
trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be
unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is
deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater
recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is
commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any
security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest.

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory
priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even if such
claims are secured claims. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, financial assistance
and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, and the Intercreditor
Agreement, as regards any guarantor or security provider incorporated in Italy (an “Italian Guarantor”):

(i) in order to comply with the provisions of the Italian law in relation to financial assistance (including
article 2358 and/or article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code), the Notes Guarantee and
security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not include and/or extend to any
amounts of the Notes the purpose or the actual use of which is to finance, directly or indirectly, the
acquisition of the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) and/or
the subscription of any shares or quota in the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect
holding companies) (or to refinance, directly or indirectly, any existing indebtedness incurred for such
purposes) and/or the payment of any fees, costs and expenses, stamp, registration or other taxes in
connection therewith;

(ii) the Notes Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed at
any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or other
financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity
contributions) advanced or made available from time to time to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its


-----

direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1 and 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by
the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Acquisition Closing Date, and
outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Notes Guarantee, in each case net of any
proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility
and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor;
provided further that no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor and/or security provider in
respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that it is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse
or subrogation (regresso or _surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian_
Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or as a result of the enforcement of any security
interests granted by it;

(iii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by any Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with
article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes;

(iv) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian
Guarantor will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of
the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the relevant Italian
Guarantor at that time;

(v) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of Civil
Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of such Guarantor under its Notes
Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the
Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions
set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Banking Act,
respectively.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations
as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon
enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate
with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor
pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any
guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the
Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue
of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian
Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the
Existing Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any agreement regulating future _pari passu_ indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto
shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction
documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such
guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the
limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by an
Italian Guarantor to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum
amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in
the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such
determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed
disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests shall be distributed among the
guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover
limited amounts under the relevant Notes Guarantees and security. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Issuer will be dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to make payments on the_**
**_Notes._**

Prior to the Post-Closing Reorganization, the Issuer will operate as a holding company that conducts no business
operations of its own and has no significant assets. As a result, the Issuer will be dependent upon the cash flow
from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends, intercompany loans or otherwise to make payments on the Notes.
The Issuer’s operating subsidiaries may not generate cash flow sufficient to enable the Issuer to meet its
payment obligations under the Notes.

The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will in part depend, on the profitability and
cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable
law or otherwise transfer funds directly or indirectly to the Issuer. In addition, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be
restricted from providing funds to the Issuer under certain circumstances, including due to legal and contractual
restrictions. These circumstances could include, among others, restrictions under Italian corporate law which
require a company to retain at least 5% of its annual unconsolidated net income until such reserve reaches at
least 20% of the value of the company’s share capital, and future contractual restrictions, including restrictions
in credit facilities and other indebtedness, that may affect the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends
or make other payments to the Issuer. In addition, applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to
taxation. Furthermore, in the event that the Target provides its Upstream Guarantee and any security interests in
respect of the Notes, a portion of its distributable profits and available reserves will, pursuant to the Whitewash
Procedure under the Italian Civil Code, be set aside to provide its Notes Guarantee and any security interests to
the Notes and, therefore, the Target may not have distributable profits and available reserves in order to make
distributions to the Issuer.

In addition, prior to the Post-Closing Reorganization, the Indenture governing the Existing Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement restrict the ability of the Target and its subsidiaries to move cash to the
Issuer in the form of dividends, intercompany loans or otherwise. Although the Existing Indenture and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement include various exceptions to such restrictions, we cannot assure you that
such exceptions will be sufficient to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness,
including the Notes.

Although the Indenture will limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on
their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to
these limitations. We cannot assure you that the arrangements with our subsidiaries, the funding permitted by
the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries and our results of operations and
cash flow generally will provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the
Notes. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be
unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes, and we do not expect to have any other
sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.

**_The interests of the Sponsor may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The Issuer is beneficially owned by funds advised by CVC, and following the Acquisition Closing Date, the
Target Group will be directly wholly owned by the Issuer. As a result, the Sponsor has, directly or indirectly, the
power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to
approve other changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our
shareholders. The Sponsor’s interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as noteholders,
particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example, the
Sponsor could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Moreover, the Sponsor is in the business of
making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or
indirectly with us and/or that operate in our markets or adjacent ones. The Sponsor may also pursue acquisition
opportunities that are complementary to or in competition with our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, the Sponsor may hold interests in suppliers or other third
party counterparties of members of the Target Group. The Sponsor and its respective affiliates could also have
an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business
or sales of our shares which would result in changes to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend
distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such
transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by Italian_**
**_law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will not be
granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not
have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the security documents or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a
result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event
of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, the
ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of
each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including the Republic of Italy. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but
require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under
the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not
identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or
can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including the Republic of
Italy). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of
security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for
the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the
obligations of the Issuer owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable
(“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be
applicable as Italian law does not provide for such a construct. All or part of the pledges and other security
interests in jurisdictions utilizing the Parallel Debt construct will be granted to the Security Agent as security
interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time
as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding
Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of
such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk
of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing
transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these
jurisdictions, including under Italian law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to
secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by
other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests
in the Collateral. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Moreover, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and
perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the
holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision
(introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond
issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then
be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any
court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance
or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interests and guarantees by a
_rappresentante_ pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on
behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically
identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security
interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes
could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under
the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the
“suspect period”). A longer period may apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which is granted after
the Offering, including the Collateral that is granted on or after the Issue Date.


-----

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory
priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims of other creditors, even if such
claims are secured claims.”

The enforcement of any security interests (including the security interests over the Collateral) located in Italy or
governed by Italian law is subject to mandatory provisions of Italian law, including in relation to limitations and
defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the security documents designed to ensure compliance with
applicable statutory requirements. In case of insolvency or crisis of any Guarantors, the enforcement of any
collateral provided by such Guarantors may be stayed or subject to certain restrictions. For a more detailed
description of various limitations on the security under Italian law, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “—_
_The Collateral, the Upstream Guarantee and any future guarantees or security of the Notes will be subject to_
_certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that_
_may limit their validity and enforceability.”_

**_The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

Following the accession by the Issuer, HoldCo and Trustee thereto, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the security agent for the holders of the Existing Notes,
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the hedging obligations which are permitted by the
Indenture to be secured on the Collateral, and any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be
incurred by the Indenture, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor
Agreement will regulate the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to
take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do
so by an Instructing Group (as defined below under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”) that comprises (i) creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the indebtedness and_
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, any other Credit Facility (as defined below under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) and certain priority hedging
obligations (the “Super Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and (ii) creditors holding more than 50.0% of the
indebtedness under the Notes and indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes (including the Existing Notes)
with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of security (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each
case acting through their respective creditor representative). If, however, before the discharge of all obligations
to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and any other Credit Facility and so long as no insolvency
event has occurred, the Security Agent has received conflicting enforcement instructions from the creditor
representatives (and for these purposes, the failure to give instructions is deemed to be a conflicting instruction)
then, to the extent the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent given) comply with
the initial consultation requirements and the security enforcement principles (one of which states that the
primary and overriding objective of an enforcement of security over the Collateral is the maximization, so far as
is consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of value, of recoveries by the Super Senior Creditors (as
defined below under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”), the holders
of the Notes and certain creditors ranking pari passu with the holders of the Notes (including the Existing Notes)
with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of security) each as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent will comply with the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if
the super senior liabilities have not been fully discharged within six months, or no enforcement action has been
taken by the Security Agent within three months, of the date on which the initial consultation period expires (or
where no consultation is required, of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors providing a specified notice), or at
any time after the occurrence of an insolvency event with respect to certain members of the Group, then the
instructions of the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. To the extent the Group incurs additional
indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of
security, your voting interest in an instructing group will be diluted commensurately with the amount of
indebtedness the Group incurs.

The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any Credit Facility and creditors in respect of
certain hedging obligations and the holders of the Existing Notes may have interests that are different from the
interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to
pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer or any of its holding
companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action or other distressed disposal in accordance with


-----

the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes against, and the liens over any other assets of, such entities
and any subsidiaries of such entity securing the Notes may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_The Issuer and the other security providers will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the operation_**
**_of the business or the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The security documents relating to the Notes allow the Issuer and the other security providers to remain in
possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from,
certain of the Collateral. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom,
the Issuer and the other security providers may, among other things, subject to the terms of the security
documents, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course
activities with respect to the Collateral (or in the case of the share pledges, the underlying business and assets)
such as selling, modifying, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral (or in the case of the
share pledges, the underlying business and assets) and making ordinary course cash payments, including
repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce
the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the
liens on the Collateral. To the extent these activities are allowed with regard to certain security interests, under
Italian law such security interests could be considered to be not validly perfected.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be_**
**_released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including upon a
sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that is otherwise permitted by the Indenture,
and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, any Notes
Guarantees may be released automatically, including upon a sale, transfer or other disposal of the capital stock
of a Guarantor in a transaction that is otherwise permitted by the Indenture or when the Issuer designates one or
more Restricted Subsidiaries that are Guarantors as Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined herein). If the Issuer
designates a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the
Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any Notes Guarantees provided by such subsidiary will also be
released under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as such
will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary or of its subsidiaries. In addition, the Indenture will provide that the applicable
Guarantees may be released automatically, without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Notes or the
Trustee, if the Guarantor is no longer a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Investors in
the Notes will not have a direct claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a Guarantor of the
Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens” and “Description of the Notes—Notes
_Guarantees.” In addition, the Guarantees and security interests will be subject to release upon a distressed_
disposal as contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under Italian law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and
thus retain its priority if certain actions are undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security
interest. The security interests in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if
we or the Security Agent fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect the security interest. Such
failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral or adversely affect the
priority of such security interest in favor of third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors
who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

In addition, if a creditor of the security provider or any other person acquires any right on the Collateral or seeks
attachment of the Collateral before the security interest in respect of the Collateral is perfected, the security
interest in respect of the Collateral may not be perfected or may only be perfected subject to any such right.

The Trustee and Security Agent will not monitor, and we may not comply with our obligations to inform the
Trustee or the Security Agent of, any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and the necessary action
may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired property or rights. Such failure


-----

may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of
such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other
creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

**_The granting of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such security_**
**_interests in accordance with Italian law._**

The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods
for such security interests in Italy and the relevant regime for hardening periods may be less favorable if the
secured debt (or part thereof) is pre-existing to the granting of the security interest, which is the case for
Collateral granted on or after the Issue Date. In addition, the granting of shared security interests to secure future
permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening periods. The applicable hardening period for these new
security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated.
In each instance, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
relevant hardening period applicable in Italy, such security interest may be declared void and/or it may not be
possible to enforce it. In addition, the granting of a shared security interest to secure future indebtedness or the
transfer or the assignment of the security interest may restart or reopen hardening periods. The applicable
hardening period for each new security may run from the moment such new security is amended, transferred,
assigned, granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted were to be enforced before the end
of the respective applicable hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be
possible to enforce it. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The same rights also apply following the Issue Date in connection with the accession of any subsidiaries as
guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of
holders of the Notes.

**_Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will not initially be guaranteed by the Target or secured by_**
**_the Collateral._**

On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer, HoldCo (as defined herein) and the Trustee will accede to
the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement, (a) on
or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured by the Issuer Share Pledge (as defined herein);
and (b) within 10 Business Days following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured by the
Target Share Pledge (as defined herein). Following the Acquisition Closing Date (as defined herein), the Issuer
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Target to guarantee the Notes within 120 days following
the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and significant limitations under
applicable laws (including the completion of the Whitewash Procedure and the other limitations ser out below).
See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations—Italy—Whitewash Procedure.” There can be no assurance that the Group will_
be successful in procuring such Guarantee and liens within the time period specified. In addition, the Guarantee
and security interests will be limited as set forth in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” which limitations could be_
significant. It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security interest granted by a Guarantor in certain
jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose, such guarantee or security interest may be
subject to clawback provisions under applicable local insolvency laws. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_You may face interest rate risks by investing in the Notes, as certain of our borrowings bear, and the Floating_**
**_Rate Notes will bear, interest at floating rates that could be impacted by applicable regulation and that could_**
**_rise significantly, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

A substantial part of our indebtedness, including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing
Notes and the Floating Rate Notes, bears or will bear interest at per annum rates equal to EURIBOR (subject to
a 0.0% floor), in each case adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the
future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available
for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes.

The Indenture will not contain nor do the Existing Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain
a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and


-----

maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that
hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks,
including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging
arrangements. In addition, if one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy and/or in the event of the
opening of the judicial liquidation, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements
may become worthless.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law
enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations
into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the
calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In
addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be
“benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the
implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European
regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the
performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of
any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may
perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other
consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR
benchmark after December 31, 2021 or after June 30, 2023, as applicable (the “FCA Announcement”). The
FCA Announcement and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and Wholesale Policy at the FCA on
January 28, 2019 indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be
guaranteed, and market participants should not rely on its publication, after 2021. The potential elimination of
the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or
actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or
LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other
consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any such change, as well as manipulative
practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or
LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the Group’s ability to service debt that bears interest at floating
rates of interest. The Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if the Issuer determines that EURIBOR is no
longer being calculated or administered, among other circumstances, the Issuer could cause an independent
financial advisor to determine an appropriate successor rate (or, if not reasonably practicable to appoint such
independent financial advisor, the Issuer would determine such successor benchmark rate), and make certain
adjustments to such rate, including applying a spread thereon to make such successor rate to reduce or eliminate
any economic benefit or prejudice to holders of the Floating Rate Notes as a result of the replacement of
EURIBOR, which upon certification by the Issuer to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying
Agent will be used to calculate the interest rate in relation to the Floating Rate Notes without any further action
or consent by the noteholders or the Trustee. This means that interest on the Floating Rate Notes would be
determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time
you purchased the Floating Rate Notes issued on the Issue Date. See “Description of the Notes—Interest.” In
addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement
of an independent financial advisor, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at
the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of
EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such
consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If
EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be
determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt. The application of these
fallback provisions could result in the Floating Rate Notes becoming fixed rate instruments.

**_Future liquidity and cash flow difficulties could prevent us from repaying the Notes when due or_**
**_repurchasing the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of_**
**_control or otherwise, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily_**
**_afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events and we will not be required to_**
**_purchase the Notes upon a Specified Change of Control Event._**

At final maturity of the Notes, or in the event of acceleration of the Notes following an event of default, the
entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes will become due and payable. In addition, upon the occurrence
of certain events constituting a change of control, holders of the Notes may in certain circumstances require us
to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued


-----

and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes—Change
_of Control.” We may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay these_
amounts when they become due.

Our failure to repay holders tendering Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control event would result in an
event of default under the Notes. If a change of control event were to occur, we cannot assure you that the Issuer
would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the
restrictions in the Existing Notes, Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our
other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of
control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes, the
Existing Notes and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a
default under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes and other indebtedness, even if the change of
control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the
holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then existing
financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If
an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when our subsidiaries are prohibited from providing
funds to the Issuer, our subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase
of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay
such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we
expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of
control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer
to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default
under the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the
_Notes—Change of Control.”_

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or other
similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a
shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as
defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”, the
Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes,
respectively, in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction. Moreover, a
change of control will be deemed not to have occurred if it constitutes a “Specified Change of Control Event.”
See “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”

The definition of “change of control” contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all
the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has
occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_The Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all_**
**_holders of the Notes with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding_**
**_Notes._**

The Indenture will contain provisions for calling meetings of the holders of the Notes to consider matters
affecting their interests generally. As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of Holders of Notes”, the
majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of the Notes will be one or more
persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. These
provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders
of the Notes, including holders of the Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of
the Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an
extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for
payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to
redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes, to change the
quorum requirements relating to meetings, to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and/or to change
the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and may
have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes. Under Italian law, the approval of an


-----

extraordinary resolution typically requires the consent of one half of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes. Our decision to increase the majority requirement is untested under Italian law, may be
challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer and others, and if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian
court, with the consequence being that the majority voting threshold may be reduced from 75% to
50%.Furthermore, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to
meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in
the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of
holders of notes issued by Italian companies is also untested in the Italian courts.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the indenture governing the Notes by beneficial owners_**
**_with short positions in excess of their interests in the Notes, will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Notes, each holder of the Notes of agrees, in connection with certain notices of Default (as
defined under “Description of the Notes”), notices of acceleration or instructions to the Trustee to provide
certain notices of Default, notices of acceleration or take (or refrain from taking) any other action (a
“Noteholder Direction”), to deliver a written representation to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder (or
beneficial owner) is not Net Short (as defined under “Description of the Notes”). Holders of the Notes, including
holders that have hedged their exposure to the Notes and/or other debt issued or guaranteed by the Group in the
ordinary course and not for speculative purposes, may not be able to make such representations. These
restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder Directions and exercise its rights subject
to mandatory provisions of Italian law and without prejudice to the provisions regarding meetings of the holders
of the Notes set out under “Description of the Notes.”

In general, provisions contemplating restrictions to the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant
meeting are untested under Italian law, may be challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer and/or others, and
if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian court. Furthermore, the interactions between (i) the provisions set
forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the
rights of each holder of the Notes (including any restrictions thereto) to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii)
applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by
Italian companies is also untested in the Italian courts.

**_Italian tax legislation may restrict the deductibility of all or a portion of the interest expense on our_**
**_indebtedness, including interest expense in respect of the Notes._**

Current tax legislation in Italy (Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as amended
and restated) provides that any interest expense of a company exceeding gross interest income of the same year
or carried forward from previous fiscal years is deductible up to a cap of 30% of EBITDA of such company.
EBITDA must be quantified on the basis of the relevant tax values (i.e. reflecting the corporate income tax
adjustments applied to the EBITDA computed from an accounting perspective). In the case of a tax group
within a domestic fiscal unity, interest expenses exceeding 30% of such company’s EBITDA may be offset
against the consolidated taxable income if and to the extent that the relevant threshold of 30% EBITDA of any
other group company is not used to deduct their own interest expenses and is available for other group
companies in the same taxable year.

In the past, the Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leveraged buyout transactions
with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. However,
on March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter No. 6/E clarifying, as a common
principle, that interest on an acquisition bank loan in leveraged buyout (“LBO”) transactions are generally
deductible for the Italian corporate income tax (“IRES”) purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in
Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986. In particular, the Italian Revenue Agency
confirmed as general principle that LBO transactions are generally based on sound economic reasons
considering that the financing from third party lenders is usually conditional on acquisition of control over the
target company by a special purpose vehicle and the following merger with debt push down. As a result of such
guidance, LBO transactions are generally not considered irregular for tax purposes absent specific
circumstances in which the tax authorities contend that the structuring of any such transaction was designed to
obtain unlawful tax advantages in violation of the law or established legal principles (e.g., re-leveraged
transactions without a change in ownership).

Since fund-to-fund transactions as well as transactions involving continuation funds even if conducted on arm’s
length terms and involving new investors and/or other changes in ownerships are untested in Italy, if the Italian


-----

Tax Authority were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of the Transactions or
of our indebtedness, including the Notes or the use of proceeds from the Offering, including on the basis of antiavoidance or anti-abusive criteria, we may be unable to fully deduct our interest expenses or be subject to
significant penalties and accrued interest, or other consequences that could have an adverse effect on our
financial condition and on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other
indebtedness.

**_Payments in respect of the Notes may in certain circumstances be made subject to withholding or deduction_**
**_of tax for which holders may not receive additional amounts._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Italy and is an Italian resident for tax purposes and therefore payments
of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to
Italian tax laws and regulations. All payments made by the Issuer or on its behalf in respect of the Notes will be
made free and clear of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless the withholding or deduction is
required by law. In that event, subject to a number of exceptions, the Issuer or the Guarantors will pay such
additional amounts that may result in the holders of the Notes receiving such amounts that they would have
received in regards to such Notes had no such withholding or deduction been required.

The Issuer and the Guarantors are not liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes in certain
circumstances, including if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No.
239 of April 1, 1996 (as amended or supplemented) (“Decree No. 239”) (except where the procedures required
under Decree No. 239 or under Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied
with due solely to the actions or omissions by the Issuer or its agents) and any related implementing regulations,
or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (as amended or supplemented)
(“Decree No. 461”). In those circumstances, investors will receive the proceeds of their investment in the Notes,
net of applicable withholding or deductions.

In particular, holders of Notes that are not residents in White List countries, holders who are residents in White
List countries that do not properly and promptly comply with certain certification and procedural requirements
set forth by Decree No. 239 and by the relevant application rules to benefit from exemption from Italian
taxation, and certain categories of holders of the Notes who are residents in Italy, will therefore only receive the
net proceeds of their investment in the Notes and will not be paid any additional amounts to compensate them
for the withholding or deduction.

Although we believe that, under current law, Italian substitute tax will not be imposed under Decree No. 239
where the Notes are listed on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility upon issuance and the holder of
Notes is a resident for tax purposes in a White List country and such holder promptly and properly complies
with certain certification and procedural requirements set forth by Decree No. 239 and by the relevant
application rules, there is no assurance that this will be the case should there be a change in applicable law or
relevant procedures. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain Italian Tax Considerations” and “Description
_of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Moreover, holders of the Notes should note that they will bear the risk of any_
change in the White List.

**_No assurance can be given that the procedural requirements provided by Decree No. 239 will be met by the_**
**_relevant foreign intermediaries._**

The exemption from withholding tax in principle granted to holders of the Notes – who are the beneficial
owners of the Notes (or, if the holders are institutional investors not subject to tax, even if they are not the
beneficial owners of the Notes) and are resident in countries included in the White List – applies if certain
procedural requirements are met. No assurance can be given that all non-Italian resident investors will be
eligible for the withholding tax exemption where the relevant foreign intermediary fails to provide sufficient
information to the relevant Italian tax authorities under the procedures for applying the exemption regime.
Should the procedural requirements not be met, Italian income substitute tax may apply on the payments made
on the Notes to foreign investors resident in countries included on the White List. In such event, the Issuer will
not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to such withholding tax, unless such procedural
requirements have not been complied with due solely to the actions or omissions of the Issuer or its agents.

**_No assurance can be given that the Notes will be listed or that, once listed, such listing will be maintained or_**
**_that such listing will satisfy the listing requirement of Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996._**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit
to trading on the Euro MTF Market in accordance with the rules and regulations of that exchange. No assurance
can be given that the Notes will be listed or that, once listed, the listing will be maintained or that such listing
will satisfy the listing requirement of Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 in order for the Notes
to be eligible to benefit from the provisions of such legislation relating to the exemption from the requirement to
apply withholding tax.

The Italian tax authorities have issued an interpretive circular relating to, among other things, the listing
requirement of the aforementioned legislation in order for the Notes to be eligible to benefit from the exemption
from withholding tax. According to a stringent interpretation of this circular, the Notes may not be eligible to
benefit from such provisions if the listing of the Notes is not effective as of the Issue Date. In the event that the
Notes are not listed as of the Issue Date or that such listing requirement is otherwise not satisfied, payments of
interest, premium and other income with respect to the Notes would be subject to a withholding tax (ritenuta a
_titolo di imposta o acconto) currently at a rate of 26%, and we would be required to pay additional amounts with_
respect to such withholding taxes such that beneficial owners receive a net amount that is not less than the
amount that they would have received in the absence of such withholding. We cannot assure you that the listing
can be achieved by the Issue Date. The imposition of withholding taxes with respect to payments on the Notes
and the resulting obligation to pay additional amounts to Holders could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing the Notes on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another recognized stock exchange in accordance with the
Indenture, failure to obtain approval for the listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another recognized stock exchange, as applicable, may have a material adverse
effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the Notes._**

The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no existing market. Application will be made to list
the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit to trading on the Euro MTF
Market in accordance with the rules and regulations of that exchange. We cannot assure you that the Notes will
become or will remain listed. In addition, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may
develop for the Notes, the ability of holders of the Notes to sell them or the price at which the holders of the
Notes may be able to sell them. The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders
of the Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general
economic conditions and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as recommendations
by securities analysts. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt securities, such as the Notes, has
been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial price volatility. If a market for the Notes were to
develop, such a market may be subject to similar disruptions. We have been informed by the Initial Purchasers
that they intend to make a market for the Notes after this Offering is completed. Nevertheless, the Initial
Purchasers are not obligated to do so and may cease their market-making activity at any time without notice. In
addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and
other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the
Notes will develop or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference
to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to,
among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to
which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over
which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors
measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their
stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the
currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes
by U.S. Holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax


-----

_Considerations”) may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if_
any. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

Despite the measures taken by countries in the Eurozone to alleviate credit risk, concerns persist regarding the
debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall
stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political
circumstances in individual Eurozone member states. These and other concerns could lead to the reintroduction
of individual currencies in one or more member states, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible
dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for
holders of euro denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. We cannot assure
you that the official exchange rate at which the Notes may be redenominated would accurately reflect their value
in euro. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these developments and related issues,
could materially adversely affect the value of the Notes.

**_Fraudulent conveyance and similar laws may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes, any_**
**_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral._**

Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer or any Guarantor organized under the laws of Italy enters into
insolvency proceedings, the security interests granted to secure the Notes (and any guarantees thereof, if
applicable) could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors under
the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Italian Insolvency Law and the relevant law
on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect period. The
avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the
declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or
undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual
means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby
the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut
any clawback action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must
prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback
action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of
due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the
secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby
the judicial receiver must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in
order to enforce any clawback action. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees
_and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for further information._

Under Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, all transactions without consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In addition,
under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the
insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the twoyear period prior to insolvency. In addition, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which
replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the
European Union.

If challenged successfully, the security interest or Notes Guarantee may become unenforceable and any amounts
received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or Notes
Guarantee is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the relevant security interest or Notes
Guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

In addition, Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency
code – introduced by virtue of, among others, the Italian Insolvency Code – being a comprehensive legal
framework regulating, among others, insolvency matters. Other than for minor changes in certain provisions of
the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, the Italian Insolvency Code came
into force starting from July 15, 2022. The previous Italian Bankruptcy Law continues to apply only to filings
for proposals of declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato
_fallimentare) and filings seeking the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei_
_debiti) or the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo), in each case filed or_
pending before July 15, 2022. As at the date hereof, the vast majority of the provisions of the Italian Insolvency
Code are untested in Italian courts and there is no guidance or case law available yet on its application;
accordingly, the practical consequences of the implementation of the Italian Insolvency Code cannot be foreseen


-----

as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. For a description of Italian insolvency laws and regulations, see
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations.”_

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be
brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a
guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a
claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which
results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and
other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke
the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice,
was to make the two following findings:

  - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor,
or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently
designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

  - that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third-party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the
act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that said third-party participated in the
fraudulent design.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer and its subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and our business is conducted entirely
outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United
States. Although the Issuer will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any
action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on
these directors and executive officers. In addition, as all the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of
its directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce
judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme
Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the
United States.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Italy. There is, therefore,
doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S. federal securities laws in an action to enforce a
U.S. judgment in Italy. In addition, the enforcement in Italy of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on
civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain
conditions. There is also doubt that a court in Italy would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies
sought in an original action brought in Italy on the basis of U.S. federal securities laws violations. See “Service
_of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies are expected to assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit
ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect
the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other
factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit
rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency in the future if in its judgment
circumstances so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the
Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our
financings and could materially adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.


-----

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they_**
**_may be sold._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws of the United States. The Notes have not been and will not be registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, you may not transfer or sell the Notes in
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective
registration statement, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment in the Notes for an indefinite
period of time. The Notes and the Indenture contain provisions that restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or
otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S
under the Securities Act, or other exemptions under the Securities Act. In addition, by acceptance of delivery of
any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has
purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of less than €100,000.
Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under any other country’s securities laws and do not have any
intention to do so. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United States
and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until definitive Notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the Notes (which will only
occur in very limited circumstances), owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or
holders of Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be
the registered holder of the Notes. After payment to the common depositary, we and the Trustee will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry
interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the
participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under the
Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon
our solicitations for consents or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures
implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions on
a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to
acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through
Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_The market value of the relevant series of Notes may be adversely affected if additional notes are considered_**
**_to have original issue discount and are not distinguishable from such Notes._**

The Issuer may issue additional notes (“Additional Notes”) as described under “Description of the Notes.”
These Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the relevant
series of original Notes in some cases, may be treated as a separate series for US federal income tax purposes
and non-fungible for Italian tax purposes (according to Article 11, paragraph 2 of Decree No. 239, see “Certain
_Tax Considerations—Certain Italian Tax Considerations—Fungible Issues”). Whether any Additional Notes_
would be fungible with the original Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes would depend on facts that
cannot be determined at this time, including the date when the Additional Notes are issued, the yield of the
applicable Notes at that time (based on their fair market value) and whether such Additional Notes are publicly
traded or quoted at the time of the issuance of the Additional Notes. If any Additional Notes are treated as a
separate series for US federal income tax purposes, such Additional Notes may be considered to have original
issue discount (“OID”) even if the original Notes had no OID, or the Additional Notes may have a different
amount of OID than the remaining OID on the original Notes. These differences may adversely affect the


-----

market value of the original Notes of such series if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from
the original Notes.

**_Under certain circumstances, following a tender offer or other offer to purchase for an applicable series of_**
**_Notes, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes of the same series of non-tendering holders._**

If, pursuant to any tender offer or other offer to purchase for an applicable series of Notes, holders of not less
than 90% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Notes (or if the Issuer so elects, in its sole and
absolute discretion, any series of Notes) validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indenture will
permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes (or if the Issuer or such third party so
elects, in its sole and absolute discretion, such series of Notes) at a price equal to that paid pursuant to such
purchase or tender offer (excluding any early tender premium). As a consequence, you may be required to
surrender the Notes against your will at a price equivalent to the lowest price paid to tendering holders,
including if such price is below par, and may not receive the return you expected to receive on the Notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The Issuer may, at its option, redeem any series of Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law._**

If, as a result of certain changes in tax law in any relevant tax jurisdiction, the Issuer or any Guarantor would
become obligated to pay additional amounts in respect of a series of Notes, the Issuer will have the option (but
not the obligation) to redeem the relevant series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption
price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes will
have the right to require the Issuer to redeem the Notes in these circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” for further discussion of redemption of the Notes for_
tax reasons.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if, at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receives two of the
following: (a) a rating of “Baa3” or higher from Moody’s, (b) a rating of “BBB−” or higher from S&P or (c) a
rating of “BBB−” or higher from Fitch (each as defined herein) and no event of default has occurred and is
continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which such Notes cease to have
such ratings, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” If these covenants were to_
cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur additional debt or make payments, including dividends or
investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the
Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Debt Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, the Group may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described in “Description of
_the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the_
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”)) will automatically
operate so that, among other things, the references to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in
“Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO
Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”) and its Restricted
Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its
obligations under the Indenture.

Such modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed
exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modification for (ii) new Notes as in place after such
modification (the “New Notes”). If such modification results in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which
beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain or loss (although any loss could be
disallowed). Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed
exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount. In such event, U.S. investors would be required
to include the original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash
corresponding to such income. In addition, the determination of whether the New Notes are treated as


-----

“contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional payments would be made at the
time of the modification. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers as to the U.S. federal income tax
considerations relating to the potential modification of the terms of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt
Pushdown. It is also possible that the IPO Debt Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax purposes other
than U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Either series of Notes may be issued with OID for US federal income tax purposes._**

U.S. investors in the Notes issued with OID will be required to include OID in gross income (as ordinary
income) over the term of such series of Notes in advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such income
is attributable (regardless of such U.S. investor’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes).
See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate the aggregate gross proceeds of the Offering will be €1,100 million, assuming the Notes are issued
at par. Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the
Offering, deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Account. The release of the Escrowed
Property will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition
promptly, on or about and in any event within three business days, following the date of release of the Escrowed
Property. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In the event
that the consummation of the Acquisition is expected to occur on or about, and in any event, within three
business days of, the Issue Date, the gross proceeds of the Offering may be directly utilized by the Issuer to,
_inter alia, complete the Acquisition as described in this section without being subject to the escrow_
arrangements described in this Offering Memorandum.

On the Acquisition Closing Date, the proceeds of the Offering and the Equity Contribution will be used by the
Issuer to finance the Acquisition, fund cash on balance sheet and to pay the estimated costs and expenses
associated with the Transactions. The expected estimated sources and uses for the Transactions are shown in the
table below. Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including
differences between the actual and the assumed date of consummation of the Acquisition as well as the
difference between estimated and actual fees, expenses and commissions.

**Overview**

**_General_**

Established in 2006, Multiversity is the leading university in the Italian online higher education market with
approximately 151,000 undergraduate enrolled students (and approximately 206,000 enrolled students in total)
for the 2022/2023 academic year. Based on the number of university students enrolled for the 2022/2023
academic year, the company has an estimated market share in the Italian online academic education of 57%, an
estimated market share in the Italian academic education (across both physical and online universities) of 8%[43]
and a student satisfaction rate of 98%[44]. Multiversity also has a leading role in the foundation of UNITED (the
first association of Italian online universities). It operates several education assets, and in particular:

  - Online universities: Multiversity operates three fully licensed private online universities in Italy with
MIUR accreditations: Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. (“Pegaso”), Universitas Mercatorum
(“Mercatorum”) and Università Telematica San Raffaele Roma S.r.l. (“San Raffaele”). It provides a
student centric proposition with a wide array of undergraduate and post graduate courses to
approximately 206,000 students for the 2022/2023 academic year and is supported by a strong
professor base (10 Multiversity professors have been included in the “Top Scientists – World Top 2%”
ranking from Stanford University). Degrees awarded at the end of academic courses have the same
legal value as degrees issued by traditional universities. 97.4% of Multiversity’s revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2023 was generated by the university segment.

  - Non-academic courses and certifications: Multiversity has also expanded into a complementary nonuniversity education segment, mainly focusing on: (i) B2B and B2C executive education through Sole
24 Ore Formazione S.p.A. (“Sole 24 Ore Formazione”), (ii) digital skills through Aulab S.r.l.
(“Aulab”), a coding factory, which delivers short term courses for software developers, and (iii) a

certification entity, Certipass S.r.l. (“Certipass”). 2.3% of Multiversity’s revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2023 was generated by the non-academic education segment.

  - Other assets: Multiversity also operates a number of academies offering courses on specific subjects
(e.g. communication, marketing and law) as well as other assets (e.g. Principe di Napoli, which
provides gastronomy and tourism higher education, or Benecon, a research center promoted by the
Campania Region). 0.3% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were
generated by the other assets segment.

Multiversity delivers its services through a proprietary online platform that produces its e-learning content,
which is developed in-house. In addition, Multiversity is also a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in
education, in particular for marketing purposes and for the development of new use cases (such as its Tutor
Chatbot and Exam Generator applications).

**_Online universities_**

Pegaso is Multiversity’s largest university. Approximately 140,000 students were enrolled in Pegaso’s online
courses for the 2022/2023 academic year. Pegaso offers a range of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses,
and in particular eight undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single cycle fiveyear degree and 158 courses, including postgraduate master’s courses and higher education and specialization
courses for professionals and high school graduates. Pegaso also offers individual certifications and gives
students the possibility to undertake single examinations for each course module upon payment of a fee without
having to complete the full course.

Multiversity’s second key institution, Mercatorum, is 66.67% owned by Multiversity, with the remaining
33.33% stake held by Unioncamere, the Italian Union of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and
Agriculture, which is the public body that unifies and institutionally represents the Italian system of chambers of
commerce. Approximately 53,000 students were enrolled in Mercatorum for the 2022/2023 academic year.
Mercatorum’s core offering consists of 14 undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees,
five Ph.D. programs and 121 courses, including postgraduate master’s courses and higher education and
specialization courses for professionals and high school graduates.

Multiversity’s third primary institution in terms of revenue, San Raffaele, became part of the Group in 2022, and
it is wholly owned by Multiversity. San Raffaele delivers courses mainly related to biomedical and healthcare
sciences, and it ranks first in research quality among digital universities and fifth among the entire national
university system.[45] Approximately 13,000 students were enrolled in San Raffaele for the 2022/2023 academic
year, and its core offering currently consists of four undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, three specialist master’s
degrees, six Ph.D. programs and 39 postgraduate master’s courses.

**_Non-academic courses and certifications_**

In relation to the non-university education segment, Multiversity operates Sole 24 Ore Formazione in
partnership with Il Sole 24 Ore S.p.A. (with Multiversity holding a majority stake of 85%) to deliver B2B and
B2C executive master's courses to professionals and young graduates. As part of the B2B offerings, Multiversity
also offers compulsory courses, soft skills, industry and managerial training to corporates. These courses can be
offered as off-the shelf, co-designed or fully customized. The B2B courses can vary in length, while the B2C
courses typically last one to six months. The new partnership benefits from a top level academic and scientific
training offer, thanks to the support of the universities that are part of the Group as well as the support and the
strong brand recognition of the Il Sole 24 Ore group (owning the 15% of Sole 24 Ore Formazione), one of the
leading finance newspapers in Italy, which provides content to readers, professionals, businesses, and
institutions on topics of economics, finance, and management. Additionally, Multiversity owns 60.61% of
Aulab, a player in the digital training sector for developers with a high placement rate of its students thanks to
an effective training model for coding and IT education, an efficient placement platform and partnerships with
top companies. This training model requires no pre-requisites and typically lasts from three to 6 months. In
addition to training, Aulab also designs and develops websites, IT platforms and software applications. The nonuniversity segment also includes Certipass, a provider of international EIPASS certifications for digital
competences and IT skills.

-----

**_Academies and other assets_**

The Group also includes a number of academies established through collaboration agreements between Pegaso,
Mercatorum and San Raffaele and their respective commercial partners, covering a wide range of specialist
subjects such as marketing, communications and media and teaching. Other assets include Principe di Napoli
S.a.r.l. (“Principe di Napoli”), established in February 2019 by Pegaso in partnership with Mercatorum
(holding 90% and 10% stakes, respectively) as a center for higher education and specialization in the sectors of
gastronomy and tourism. Apart from the Postgraduate School in Legal Professions (as further described below),
Principe di Napoli is one of the few institution within Multiversity to hold on premise courses. Additionally, in
December 2023, the Group acquired a minority stake in Materias S.r.l., an incubator of scientific research
activities engaged in identifying innovative ideas in the field of advanced materials, primarily generated from
the academic sector.

Multiversity also operates a publishing entity and companies dedicated to research, which are mostly ancillary
and in support of the three universities. Almost the entirety of its operations are located in Italy, with some
limited operations in Malta (Pegaso International). It also has collaboration agreements with several partners in
Italy for the development and delivery of specialized courses in a multitude of subjects, made available through
its three universities.

In order to support their online offering, Multiversity’s institutions have an extensive network of approximately
1,000[46] e-learning center points (the “ELCPs”) as of December 31, 2023. The ELCPs provide information to
prospective and current students about the various institutions and serve as orientation centers for new students
throughout the entire duration of the course they undertake. The ELCP Points performed orientation activities
for approximately 61% of Multiversity’s institution’s new students as of December 31, 2023; however, the
relevant institution retains the direct relationship with student as it manages the enrollment process and tuition
fee payments directly with the student[47]. As regards the ELCP Points across Certipass, these purchase EIPASS
cards from Certipass and on-sell them to customers who wish to obtain an EIPASS certification. All ELCPs are
managed by external third parties that have entered into specific accreditation agreements with Pegaso,
Mercatorum, San Raffaele or Certipass (in some cases, more than one institution has entered into an
accreditation agreement with the same ELCP). See “Material Contracts—Accreditation agreements for ELCPs”
below.

**_Financial Performance_**

Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to €419.9 million, as
compared to €332.0 million for the prior financial year ended December 31, 2022 (an increase of 26.5%).
Enrolled undergraduate students at Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele increased by approximately 28% in
the 2022/2023 academic year with respect to the 2021/2022 academic year.

In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generated for the year ended December 31, 2023 was €247.2 million as
compared to €200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (an increase of 23.6%). Adjusted EBITDA
margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 58.9%, as compared to 60.2% for the year ended December
31, 2022.

Furthermore, Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow generated for the year ended December 31, 2023 was €226.0
million, as compared to €157.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (an increase of 43%). Adjusted
Cash Conversion for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 91%, as compared to 79% for the year ended
December 31, 2022 (an increase of 12%).

**_Business Model_**

Multiversity’s business model is based on a student-centric offering of a flexible learning experience and access
to teaching content through its proprietary and technologically advanced e-learning platform. Multiversity’s
universities address specific unmet demand in the market for a flexible path to an undergraduate degree, whilst
catering to specific professions for postgraduate continuous learning.

46 Some entities perform services for, and have entered into accreditation agreements with, more than one of Pegaso,
Mercatorum, San Raffaele and Certipass.

47 With reference to the 2022/2023 academic year.


-----

Revenues are mainly driven by tuition fees paid by students, which contributed to 75%[48] of Multiversity’s
revenues. Almost the entirety of tuition fees is self-funded by students, with less than 1% paid through
scholarships. The levels of tuition fees in turn depend on the number of students, the nature or class of degree
undertaken, the year of enrollment, the type of course and the student’s selected enrollment channel, amongst
other factors. Undergraduate degrees, which are multi-year courses (three-year bachelor’s degree plus a twoyear specialist master’s degree, or a single-cycle five-year degree), are a recurring multi-year revenue stream for
the term of the program (consisting of both the tuition fees and any other ancillary fees), which has an average
course length of approximately 2.4 years. Approximately 30% of Multiversity's graduates who have completed
three-year undergraduate degree courses wish to continue their education and apply to enroll in two-year
specialist master’s degree and master’s degree courses with the same institution.

On the other hand, one-year postgraduate courses (i.e. second level master’s which may be undertaken by
students who have already completed a three year undergraduate bachelor’s degree plus a two year specialist
master’s degree or a single-cycle five year degree), together with higher education courses and specialization
courses, provide a one-off tuition fee payment per student, accounting for 6% of Multiversity’s revenues for the
financial year ended December 31, 2023. Various other services offered to students provide additional revenue
such as fees payable in order to take examinations in an alternative location, and certificates; such additional
services accounted for approximately 14% of Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31,
2023. Single exams contributed to 1% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. The
non-academic business segment (including Certipass, Aulab and Sole 24 Ore Formazione) accounted for
approximately 2% of Multiversity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The other assets segment (which include Principe di Napoli, Benecon and other smaller companies) accounted
for 0.3% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.

With respect to student orientation, around 61% of new students as of December 31, 2023 (contributing to 62%
of commercial revenues for the 2022/2023 academic year) across Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele partook
in orientation activities at the approximately 1,000 ELCPs that make up Multiversity’s national network.
Approximately 39% of students as of December 31, 2023 (contributing to 38% of commercial revenues for the
2022/2023 academic year) were reached through traditional marketing methods, e.g. billboards and TV
advertising campaigns on both private and public Italian channels, as well as through its extensive online
presence on social media and online advertising, thereby gaining access to the widest possible audience and
delivery tangible results, with an increase in new leads of 50% in 2023 compared to 2022. Multiversity has
established a nation-wide presence, with approximately 100 exam venues located in prestigious and historical
buildings, along with a strong online social community and proprietary technology platforms for online classes,
exams and tutoring.

Multiversity’s growth strategy is predominantly based on expanding volumes by increasing market penetration
within the population, whilst selectively increasing its course offering, its brand awareness, digital marketing
practices and _ad hoc_ orientation services to prospective students as well as by entering into commercial
agreements and partnerships.

Additionally, revenues are driven by increases in our tuition fees taking into account inflation and other
commercial considerations. For example, Multiversity increased its undergraduate tuition fees for newly
enrolling students by approximately 8% on average for the 2022/2023 academic year, as compared to the prior
academic year. See further “Business—Competitive Strengths” and “Business—Business Strategy.”

The main objective underpinning Multiversity’s business strategy is to consolidate its market position and
strengthen its position as the leading entirely online education group in the Italian market, employing both
Business-to-Consumer and Business-to-Business marketing strategies in order to target an ever-wider audience
of students. See further “Business—Competitive Strengths” and “Business—Business Strategy.”

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations have been affected in the periods under review, and are expected to continue to be
affected, by various key factors relating to our business and industry, which we describe below. For further
discussion of the factors affecting our results of operations, see “Risk Factors.”

48 Excluding any fees payable by students for ancillary services, such as supplemental tuition fee or the alternative exam location
fee.


-----

**_Macroeconomic Conditions and Demand_**

Nearly all of our revenues were derived from our operations in Italy. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our
operations in Italy represented more than 99% of our revenue, with the remainder being generated in Malta. As
a result, our results of operations are, and will continue to be affected by, macroeconomic and political
developments in or affecting Italy and, in particular, the impact of such developments on the demand for private
university and post-graduate education. Demand is driven by factors including GDP, consumer confidence and
disposable income levels, interest rates, inflation, changes to Italy’s sovereign credit rating and liquidity
concerns in financial markets, which can impact enrolment figures and our ability to raise the fees we charge.
For further information, see “Risk Factors—Adverse changes in certain macroeconomic factors may negatively
_affect Multiversity's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.”_

During the period under review, each of Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele have experienced significant
increases in net undergraduate enrollment. The following table shows the number of undergraduate students (in
thousands) enrolled at each of Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele for the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023
academic years:

**Academic Year** **Growth y/y**

**Institution** **2021/2022** **2022/2023**

Pegaso ....................................................................................................... 79 94 19%

Mercatorum .............................................................................................. 31 46 45%

San Raffaele ............................................................................................. 8 11 45%

**Total across Multiversity .......................................................................** **118** **151** **28%**

Increasing enrollments in the courses offered by our educational institutions is critical to our financial
performance. Our results are primarily driven by year-on-year enrollments, both from new students (that offset
leavers and graduating students in any one year) and existing students that decide to re-enroll. The online
education market has shown constant growth in Italy since the 2015/2016 academic year. See “Industry—The
_Italian higher education market has historically demonstrated stable growth which in recent years has been_
_accelerated by online enrollments, yet graduate penetration is still well below other nations in Europe due to a_
_number of structural challenges.”_ In line with this trend, the number of students enrolled in Pegaso’s,
Mercatorum’s and San Raffaele’s undergraduate degree courses for the 2022/2023 academic year increased by
28% with respect to the previous academic year. See “Business—Offering” and “Business—Enrollment, Student
_Demographics and Performance by Entity” for further details on the number of students enrolled in Pegaso,_
Mercatorum and San Raffaele.

In the 2022/2023 academic year, according to MIUR, approximately 1.9 million undergraduate students enrolled
at Italian universities, which represents an increase of approximately 40,000 (or 2%) compared to the previous
academic year and an increase of approximately 200,000 (or 11%) compared to the level recorded over the last
decade. The increase in new enrollments at Italian universities is primarily driven by a growth in enrollments at
online universities, which is in turn mainly driven by flexibility of degree programmes, greater availability of
exam sessions available and cost savings (Market Report).

**_Tuition Fees_**

Our primary source of revenue is tuition fees, representing 75% of our revenues for the year ended December
31, 2023. Revenues from tuition fees amounted to €316.7 million, €244.2 million and €190.3 million in the
years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In Italy, fees and fee increases for private schools are unregulated and are set with reference to commercial
considerations. We set our tuition fees at the start of the academic year for newly enrolling students. For
students enrolled in multiple year programs, tuition fees are set at the time of enrollment in the program.

The following table sets forth our revenues from undergraduate, postgraduate and single courses for the periods
indicated.

**Year ended December 31,**

**2021** **2022** **2023**

_(€ million)_

Fees for enrollment in undergraduate degree courses ............................ 162.9 207.5 285.6


_(€ million)_


-----

Fees for enrollment in postgraduate courses .......................................... 22.7 30.7 26.0

Fees for enrollment in single courses ..................................................... 4.7 6.1 5.0

In the 2022/2023 academic year, new undergraduate enrollments increased by approximately 33% and our
tuition fees for newly enrolling students increased by approximately 8% on average, from approximately €1,600
per year in the 2021/2022 academic year to approximately €1,700 per year in the 2022/2023 academic year. This
increase in tuition fees was, together with increases in enrollments, one of the main drivers of the growth of our
value of production increasing from €332.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to €419.9 million in
the year ended December 31, 2023 (an increase of 26.5%).

We view tuition fee increases as an opportunity to ensure that the cost of inflation we experience can be passed
on to our students, thus supporting our operating margins.

**_Acquisitions and Partnerships_**

We have historically expanded our operations through acquisitions of other universities as well as non-academic
institutions. Through our strategic acquisitions and partnerships, we have been able to offer to students a more
expansive and comprehensive range of education products and services.

Our significant acquisitions since January 1, 2021 include:

  - On September 16, 2022, the acquisition of 60.61% of Aulab, a company active in the training of
software developers, which also designs and develops websites, IT platforms and software applications.
This acquisition is reflected in our results of operations from September 30, 2022.

  - On October 4, 2022, the acquisition of the entire share capital of San Raffaele, an academic institution
that delivers courses mainly related to biomedical and healthcare sciences. This acquisition is reflected
in our results of operations from October 31, 2022.

  - On October 3, 2022, the entry into an investment and shareholders’ agreement with Il Sole 24 Ore
S.p.A., one of the leading Italian finance newspapers (holding a minority stake of 15%, while we hold
the remaining 85%) to establish a partnership to operate Sole 24 Ore Formazione, which delivers B2B
and B2C executive master's courses to professionals and young graduates. This partnership is reflected
in our results of operations from November 9, 2022.

Acquisitions and partnerships impact our financial position and results of operations in a variety of ways. For
example, we incur costs related to the acquisition of the business, including the purchase price of the acquired
business and the costs of integrating it. In addition, acquisitions and partnerships can impact the comparability
of our results between periods as our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place include the
results of the acquired business only from the date of completion of the acquisition and the full impact of the
acquired business is only reflected in subsequent periods. See “—Key Factors Affecting Comparability—
_Acquisitions” below._

**_Interest rate fluctuations_**

Our financial expenses are affected by the movement of interest rates, particularly EURIBOR, which is the
reference rate for most of our floating rate borrowings, including the Existing Notes and the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility. Almost 100% of our borrowings are subject to a floating interest rate. Our policy is to hedge a
portion of our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps, which seek to convert a portion of our
floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities. However, we are not fully hedged and we remain exposed to
changes in interest rates on our unhedged borrowings and on the fair value of our interest rate swaps. As of the
date of this Offering Memorandum, approximately 65% of the outstanding principal amount of our floating rate
borrowings was hedged through a derivative financial instrument (caps with 0.5% strike) expiring in April 2025,
with €265 million in notional amount of interest rate swaps. See also “—Quantitative and Qualitative
_Disclosures about Market Risk—Interest rate risk.”_

In the year ended December 31, 2023, we experienced an increase in financial expenses due to the rise in
EURIBOR over the period, which resulted in increased interest payments on our floating rate borrowings to the
extent unhedged. We monitor the interest rate environment and the effectiveness of our hedging strategy on a


-----

regular basis and may adjust our hedging position as appropriate to achieve our desired risk profile. We also
consider the availability and cost of alternative sources of financing and the maturity profile of our debt
portfolio to optimize our capital structure and liquidity position.

**_Key Performance Indicators_**

The demographic profile of our students is a key operational metric to manage our educational institutions. We
monitor the age, year of enrollment, origin and geography of our students as we believe that they are the most
reliable metrics for measuring the profitability of our educational institutions.

Undergraduates make up the majority of our student population and we tend to observe a high incidence of (i)
younger students (students aged 18-34) and first-generation students (i.e., students accessing higher education
for the first time) which have been and are expected to increase in the near future; and (ii) students from
Southern Italy and Islands (as a reflection of our original footprint).

For further information, see “Business—Demographics of Multiversity’s Student Population.”

**Key Factors Affecting Comparability**

**_Acquisitions_**

We account for acquisitions in subsidiaries using the acquisition method of accounting and the book value of the
investments consolidated on a line-by-line basis is eliminated against the corresponding portion of shareholders’
equity, less the result for the year, at the date of first inclusion in the consolidation. The difference between the
acquisition cost and the net equity of the subsidiaries at the date of first consolidation is allocated, where
possible, to the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries net of the related deferred taxes, where applicable; any
remaining difference, if positive and if the requirements for recording goodwill provided for by OIC 24 are met,
is recognized in the item ‘Goodwill’ within intangible assets.

For a list of our material acquisitions since January 1, 2021 and the date from which the acquired companies
have been consolidated into the Consolidated Financial Statements, see “—Acquisitions and Partnerships.”

**_2021 Acquisition and 2022 Reverse Merger_**

As a result of the 2021 Acquisition and the 2022 Reverse Merger described further under “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information—2021 Acquisition and 2022 Reverse Merger”, the financial information of_
the Group as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 reflects the results of operation and
financial condition of Multiversity S.p.A. (the surviving entity) and its consolidated subsidiaries (including the
results of operations and financial condition of the Perimeter Assets). The financial information as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2021 presented herein reflects the results of operations and financial condition of
Multiversity S.r.l. (which was converted into Multiversity S.p.A. following the 2022 Reverse Merger) and its
consolidated subsidiaries only and does not completely reflect the results of operations and financial condition
of the Perimeter Assets. As a result, the financial information presented as of and for the year ended December
31, 2021 is not directly comparable to the financial information presented for subsequent periods. For additional
information, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” From an accounting perspective, the
comparability of financial information presented as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022
result from the purchase price accounting and debt financing in connection with the 2021 Acquisition and the
subsequent effects of the 2022 Reverse Merger, each as described in more detail in notes 6.2 and 6.4 of the
2023/2022 Consolidated Financial Statements. While the 2021 Acquisition affects comparability of the balance
sheet, amortization and finance costs across the two periods, it does not materially affect comparability of our
underlying business performance as presented in our revenues, production value, production costs (other than
increased depreciation and amortization as a result of purchase price accounting) or EBITDA.

**Description of Key Line Items and Certain Key Performance Indicators of Multiversity**

**_Value of production_**

The value of production primarily comprises the operating income from the educational offerings of Pegaso,
Mercatorum and San Raffaele, as well as from Certipass and Aulab, all included in the consolidated financial
statements using the line-by-line method (which involves the inclusion of all assets, liabilities, income and


-----

expenses in their entirety, irrespective of the size of the holding, and the attribution to minority shareholders,
under the items “capital and reserves pertaining to minority interests” and “profit (loss) of minority interests”
respectively). These include fees for enrollment in degree, postgraduate and single courses, contributions from
students, off-site exams, issuing diplomas and certificates, and training courses.

Revenue from sales and services are recognized on the basis of the relevant accounting principles and are shown
as net of returns, discounts, rebates and premiums.

Other revenues and income mainly concern grants related to university research projects and to ancillary
services relating to the educational offerings of Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele.

Most of our revenues from newly enrolled academic students are deferred on the basis of the academic year
which starts on August 1 and ends on July 31 of the following year, calculating the actual days. See “Critical
_Accounting Policies—Receivables.” The tuition fees for undergraduate courses and academic master’s degrees_
are due in four equal installments payable in November, May, June and July of each academic year, while the
tuition fees for postgraduate master’s courses and single courses are paid as a lump sum.

**_Costs of production_**

Operating costs comprise the direct and indirect costs attributable to our operations and mainly include the costs
of services, costs for use of third-party assets, personnel costs, other operating expenses and amortization,
depreciation and write-downs.

_Costs of services_

The largest components of costs of services are advertising and contributions to guidance centers. Costs of
services also include teaching, the corporate bodies compensation, technical and financial advisory fees,
insurance, bank and postal charges, utilities, maintenance and other costs, and contribution to ELCPs.

_Costs for use of third-party assets_

The cost for use of third-party assets primarily relates to rental costs for the offices of the universities of the
Group, rental of cars and other equipment used in the operating activities of the Group, and royalties for use of
the Multiversity name and platform.

_Cost of personnel_

The cost of personnel reflects all expenses for employees including wages and salaries, social security charges,
the cost of unused holidays, legal provisions and collective agreements.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses mainly include costs for stamp duty, donations to organizations and associations,
various taxes and duties and contingent liabilities.

_Amortization, depreciation and write-downs_

The most significant component of amortization, depreciation and write-downs is the amortization of intangible
assets. This is mainly comprised of the amortization of goodwill and also contains the amortization of
trademarks, platforms and other rights. Amortization, depreciation and write-downs also includes write-downs
for bad debt, provisions, and depreciation of plant, property and equipment.

Depreciation and amortization are determined on a straight-line basis to the historical cost, including directly
attributable accessory charges, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, respectively, with
goodwill being depreciated over 20 years. Write-downs for impairment of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets is recognized when their recoverable value is lower than their book value. Write-downs of
trade receivables are recognized to align their carrying amount to their presumed realisable value and in
connection with losses incurred.

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial income and expenses include all the positive and negative components, respectively, of the results for
the year connected with the financial activity of the Group and are recognized on the basis of the accrual
principle. Financial income is largely comprised of the discounting of receivables and financial expenses is
primarily comprised of interest expense on bond and other financial payables.

**_Income taxes_**

Current income taxes are allocated according to the accrual principle on the basis of the income tax charges
resulting from the application of tax legislation in force and are reflected based on tax payables net of advances.

Deferred and prepaid taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the value attributed to
the tax assets and liabilities according to statutory criteria and the value attributed to the same assets and
liabilities for current tax purposes.

Deferred tax liabilities are entered in the ‘Provision for deferred taxes’, recorded under liabilities among the
provisions for risks and charges, while the deferred tax assets are recorded within the receivables from others
under current assets.

Deferred tax assets are not recognized, in compliance with the prudence principle, if there is not reasonable
certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be reversed, of a
taxable income higher than the amount of the differences that will be cancelled. Liabilities for deferred taxes are
recognized only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year in which the tax
asset will be realised or the tax liability will be settled, based on the tax legislation established by the provisions
in force at the reporting date.

_Revenues from sales and services_

The revenues from sales and services of the Group increased by €85.8 million, or 26.1%, from €328.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €414.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase
was primarily due to higher student enrollments in both undergraduate and post-graduate courses, an increase in
tuition fees for new enrollments, non-tuition fee increases due to higher enrollment in undergraduate courses,
and the impact of the acquisition of San Raffaele, Sole 24 Ore Formazione and Aulab, which were fully
consolidated for the year ended December 31, 2023 in comparison to the three months revenue contributions of
Aulab and the two months revenue contributions of San Raffaele and Sole 24 Ore Formazione for the year
ended December 31, 2022.

Excluding the revenue contributions generated by the acquisition of San Raffaele, equal to €5.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022 (limited to the two months consolidation) and to €30.2 for the year ended
December 31, 2023, the revenues from sales and services of the Group increased by €60.8 million, or 18.8%,
from €323.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €384.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2023.

Pegaso is the largest single contributor to Multiversity’s results and accounted for 65.9% of Multiversity’s
revenues from sales and services for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. Mercatorum accounted for
24.3% of Multiversity’s revenues from sales and services for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. San
Raffaele accounted for 7.3% of Multiversity’s revenues from sales and services for the financial year ended
December 31, 2023.

The breakdown of revenues from sales and services for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 is set forth
below:

Further information on the revenue contribution and operational performance of Pegaso, Mercatorum and San
Raffaele is provided below.

_Pegaso_

The revenues from sales and services of Pegaso increased by €30.6 million, or 12.6%, from €242.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022 to €273.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was
primarily attributable to the growth in undergraduate students’ enrollments and the increase in tuition fees.

With regard to degree courses, during the 2022/2023 academic year, Pegaso experienced a 19% increase in the
number of undergraduate enrollments.


-----

_Mercatorum_

The revenues from sales and services of Mercatorum increased by €26.3 million, or 35.5%, from €74.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €100.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase
was primarily driven by the growth in undergraduate students’ enrollments and the increase in tuition fees.

With regard to degree courses, during the 2022/2023 academic year, Mercatorum experienced a 45% increase in
the number of undergraduate enrollments.

_San Raffaele_

The revenue of San Raffaele increased by €25.0 million or more than 100%, from €5.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022 to €30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily
attributable to its full consolidation for the year ended December 31, 2023 in comparison to the two months
revenue contribution for the year ended December 31, 2022, following its acquisition.

With regard to degree courses, during the 2022/2023 academic year, San Raffaele experienced a 45% increase
in the number of undergraduate enrollments.

The following table shows the number of undergraduate students (in thousands) enrolled at each of Pegaso,
Mercatorum and San Raffaele for the academic years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023:

**Academic Year** **Growth y/y (%)**

**Institution** **2021/2022** **2022/2023**

Pegaso ....................................................................................................... 79 94 19%

Mercatorum .............................................................................................. 31 46 45%

San Raffaele ............................................................................................. 8 11 45%

**Total across Multiversity .......................................................................** **118** **151** **28%**

In addition, the table below shows the breakdown of the total number of students (in thousands) of each of
Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele for each of the academic years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 by type of
academic course.


**Growth**

**y/y (%)**


**Total across**
**Multiversity**


**Pegaso** **Mercatorum**


**San Raffaele**


**Course** **21/22** **22/23** **21/22** **22/23** **21/22** **22/23** **21/22** **22/23**

Undergraduate Courses [49] 79 94 31 46 8 11 118 151 28%

Postgraduate Courses[50] 40 40 3 6 0 1 43 47 9%

**Total** **127** **140** **35** **53** **8** **13** **170** **206** **21%**

The absolute number of enrollments is not reflective of the weight on revenue of the courses. The evolution of
the student base highlights a fast-growing trend in the undergraduate degree offering, which represents the
largest contributor to revenue given higher tuition fees and a longer duration of the students’ academic career
(undergraduate degrees tend to have a duration spanning from three to five years, while postgraduate courses
and individual courses mostly last one year), whilst showing a decline in enrollments in individual courses.

49 Includes undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, specialist master’s degrees and five-year single cycle degrees (laurea magistrale).

50 Includes postgraduate master’s courses, higher education courses, specialization courses and (in respect of Pegaso) certifications.

51 Includes single exams.

_Other revenues and income_

Value of production includes other revenues and income of the Group, which increased by €1.9 million, or
55.9%, from €3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €5.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2023 and were primarily associated with grants for research projects of Pegaso, Mercatorum and San
Raffaele.

**_Costs of production_**

_Costs for services_

Costs for services of the Group increased by €25.0 million, or 26.7%, from €93.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to €118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in
contributions relating to ELCPs, costs incurred for promotional activities, teachers’ salaries and technical, legal
and administrative consultancy costs. However, costs for services did not register a significant change as a
percentage of the total value of production across the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
increasing slightly from around 28.1% to 28.2%.

_Costs for use of third party assets_

Costs for use of third party assets of the Group increase by €3.7 million, or 80.0%, from €4.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022 to €8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to costs
associated with the companies acquired in the year ended December 31, 2022, such as the headquarters of Sole
24 Ore Formazione, the offices of San Raffaele and costs in relation to Aulab, and rental fees for classrooms,
conference centres for exams and graduation ceremonies.

_Cost of personnel_

Personnel costs of the Group increased by €14.9 million, or 53.8%, from €27.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to €42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven
by a change in the consolidation perimeter due to the acquisition and integration of Aulab, San Raffaele and
Sole 24 Ore Formazione on September 16, 2022, October 4, 2022 and November 9, 2022, respectively, and a
management and staff expansion in Multiversity, Pegaso and Mercatorum in order to support the Group’s past
and expected growth.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses of the Group increased by €5.9 million, from €13.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to €19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily
attributable to the disposal of certain software no longer used by Multiversity.

_Amortization, depreciation and write-downs_

**Year ended December 31,** **Change** **Change**

**2022** **2023** **(%)**

**(In thousands of Euro, except percentages)**

Amortization, depreciation and write-downs of the Group increased by €13.3 million, from €72.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022 to €86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was
primarily attributable to the variation of the consolidation perimeter due to the acquisition of San Raffaele,
Aulab and Sole 24 Ore Formazione which occurred in the year ended December 31, 2022, and the amortization
of trademarks, platforms and rights owned by Multiversity and the universities of the Group.


**(In thousands of Euro, except percentages)**


-----

The costs related to the write-down of receivables increased by €4.5 million, or 40.5%, from €11.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022 to €15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, based on the
estimation of the recoverable value of trade receivables.

_Financial income and expenses_

Net financial expenses of the Group amounted to €49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared
to net financial expenses of €44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily
attributable to interest charges and additional costs in relation to the Existing Notes (bearing floating rate
interests), and interest payments, ancillary charges and commitment fees in relation to the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement. These expenses were partially offset by financial income derived from a positive
cash flow generated by derivative financial assets instruments used to cover the exposure to the risk of
variability of financial cash flows attributable to the Existing Notes.

_Profit before taxes_

For the reasons discussed above, the Group’s profit before taxes increased by €20.3 million, or 28.1%, from
€72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €92.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

_EBITDA_

31, 2022 to €214.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the
growth in students’ enrollments and the increase in tuition fees.

For the definition and reconciliation of EBITDA to our financial statements see “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information” and “Summary Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

**_Income taxes_**

Income taxes of the Group increased by €9.7 million, or 22.3%, from €43.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to €53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was mainly due to the increase
in profit before taxes during the year.

Mercatorum and San Raffaele for the academic years 2020/2021 and 2021/2022:

**Academic Year** **Growth y/y (%)**

**Institution** **2020/2021** **2021/2022**

Pegaso ................................................................................................. 68 79 15%

Mercatorum ........................................................................................ 18 31 70%

San Raffaele ....................................................................................... N/A 8 N/A

**Total across Multiversity .................................................................** **87** **118** **36%**

In addition, the table below shows the breakdown of the total number of students (in thousands) of each of
Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele for each of the academic years 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 by type of
academic course.


**Growth**

**Total ..................................** **106** **127** **23** **35** N/A **8** **128** **170** **32%**

The absolute number of enrollments is not reflective of the weight on revenue of the courses. The evolution of
the student base highlights a fast-growing trend in the undergraduate degree offering, which represents the
largest contributor to revenue given the higher tuition fee and duration of the students’ academic career
(undergraduate degrees tend to have a duration spanning from three to five years, while postgraduate courses
and individual courses mostly last one year).

_Other revenues and income_

Value of production includes other revenues and income of the Group which increased by €1.4 million, or
69.0%, from €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €3.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2022 and were primarily associated with operating grants amounting to €2.4 million and mainly including
contributions received from public and private entities related to educational and teaching projects carried out by
the Group’s universities, and €1.0 million of other revenues and income which includes ordinary windfall and
other ancillary services.

**_Costs of production_**

_Costs for services_

Costs for services of the Group increased by €15.6 million, or 20.1%, from €77.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to
higher contributions to e-learning centre points as consequence of the revenues increase, higher consulting costs
due to the numerous M&A activities carried out by the Group and a reduction of advertising due to an
optimization of marketing campaigns investments.

_Costs for use of third-party assets_

Costs for use of third-party assets of the Group decreased by €0.1 million, or 2.1%, from €4.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 to €4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and primarily included
rental costs for the administrative and didactical offices.

_Cost of personnel_

Personnel costs of the Group increased by €10.5 million, or 60.6%, from €17.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven
by the increase in the number of employees of the main universities of the Group: Pegaso, Mercatorum and San
Raffaele.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses of the Group increased by €6.5 million, from €6.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This mainly included costs for
stamp duty paid amounting to €3.1 million, costs related to the exit indemnity of Mr. Danilo Iervolino
amounting to €3.0 million, non-deductible VAT related to royalties paid to Multiversity S.p.A. by Pegaso and
Mercatorum amounting to €4.8 million and other indirect taxes, duties and liabilities.

**Total amortization, depreciation and write-downs ..............** **44,391** **72,688** **28,297** **63.7%**

Amortization, depreciation and write-downs of the Group increased by €28.3 million, from €44.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 to €72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was
primarily attributable to amortization and depreciation of intangible assets due to the accounting effect of the
2021 Acquisition and 2022 Reverse Merger. See “—Key Factors Affecting Comparability—2021 Acquisition
_and 2022 Reverse Merger.”_

The costs related to the write-down of receivables increased by €3.5 million, or 46.9%, from €7.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 to €11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and is based on the
estimation of recoverable value of the trade receivables.

_Financial income and expenses_

Net financial expenses of the Group amounted to €44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared
to net financial income of €0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The financial expense was
primarily in relation to interest charges and additional costs related to the Existing Notes, interest and ancillary
charges related to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, and interest and ancillary costs related to the bridge-tocash facility reimbursed in July 2022.


**(In thousands of Euro, except percentages)**

_Profit before taxes_

For the reasons discussed above, the Group's profit before taxes decreased by €31.0 million, or 30.0%, from to
€103.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA of the Group increased by €40.6 million, or 22.4%, from €140.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to €181.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an
increase in revenues, lower ratio on sales to marketing costs, business volumes growth and the achievement of a
better operating leverage.

For the definitional reconciliation of EBITDA to our financial statements see “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information” and “Summary Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

_Income taxes_

Income taxes of the Group increased by €8.9 million, or 25.8%, from €34.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The tax charge for the year ended
December 31, 2022 was primarily related to imposition of the Italian corporate tax and the Italian regional tax
on productive activities.

**Cash Flows**

_The following presents a discussion of the cash flows of the Group derived from the Consolidated Financial_
_Statements. As a result of the 2021 Acquisition and 2022 Reverse Merger, the financial information as of and_
_for the year ended December 31, 2021 does not completely reflect the results of operations and financial_
_condition of the Perimeter Assets and may not be comparable with the financial information as of and for the_
_year ended December 31, 2022. For additional information on the impact of the 2021 Acquisition and 2022_
_Reverse Merger and comparability across periods, see “—Key Factors Affecting Comparability—2021_
_Acquisition and 2022 Reverse Merger” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”_

The following table sets forth a summary of cash flows of the Group for the periods indicated below:


**Year ended December 31,**


**2021** **2022** **2023**


**(In thousands of Euro)**


Cash flow from operating activities (A) ..................................................... 103,45 68,416 136,963

Cash flow from investing activities (B) ...................................................... (24,936) (228,540) (6,091)

Cash flow from financing activities (C) ...................................................... 1,493 (181,501) (61,677)

**Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (A ± B ± C) ..............** **80,006** **(341,625)** **69,196**

**Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period ....................** **122,846** **442,784** **101,159**

**Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period ...............................** **202,852** **101,159** **170,355**

_Operating activities_

Total cash flow from operating activities of the Group increased by €68.5 million, from €68.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022 to €137.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due
to the increase in profits for the year, an increase in interest income and capital gains from the disposal of assets.

Total cash flow from operating activities of the Group decreased by €35.0 million, from €103.4 million in the
year ended December 31, 2021 to €68.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily
driven by interest on the Existing Notes and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, together with amortization
and depreciation, and partially offset by the change in working capital.

_Investing activities_

Total cash flow used in investing activities of the Group amounted to an outflow of €6.1 million in the year
ended December 31, 2023, compared to an outflow of €228.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The
cash flow used in investing activities of the Group during the year ended December 31, 2023 mainly related to
investments in tangible fixed assets such as hardware, furniture and refurbishment of university examination


-----

sites, investments allocated to IT projects for enhancing course delivery platforms for students, and the
acquisition of shares in Materias S.r.l.

Total cash flow from investing activities of the Group amounted to an outflow of 228.5 million outflow in the
year ended December 31, 2022 compared to an outflow of €24.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.
The cash flow used in investing activities of the Group is primarily due to the acquisition of Aulab, San Raffaele
and Sole 24 Ore Formazione on September 16, 2022, October 4, 2022 and November 9, 2022, respectively.

_Financing activities_

Total cash flow used in financing activities of the Group amounted to an outflow of €181.5 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022, compared to an outflow of €61.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash
flow used in financing activities of the Group was mostly related to the reimbursements made under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement for €55.0 million, dividends of approximately €6.7 million paid to a
minority shareholder of Unimercatorum S.r.l. and the interest paid on the Existing Notes and under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, amounting to €45.5 million.

Total cash flow from financing activities of the Group amounted to an inflow of €1.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, compare to an outflow of €181.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash flow
used in financing activities of the Group is primarily due to a “bridge-to-cash” loan reimbursement under
contractual terms by €221.0 million in July 2022.

Investments in property, plant and equipment of the Group increased by €1.0 million from €0.6 million for the
total year ended December 31, 2022 to €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and were primarily
related to the Group’s purchase of new computers, hardware and furniture, and the refurbishment costs of
university examination sites.

Investments in property, plant and equipment of the Group decreased by €0.3 million from €0.9 million for the
total year ended December 31, 2021 to €0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and were primarily
related to investments in furnishings and hardware used in the various offices of the Group, the development of
equipment for the delivery of non-university educational services, and investments into assets to provide
educational services.

Investments in intangible assets of the Group decreased by €2.3 million from €4.8 million for the total year
ended December 31, 2022 to €2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and were primarily related to
information technology projects aimed at enhancing the utilization of course delivery platforms for students.

Investments in intangible assets of the Group increased by €0.8 million from €4.0 million for the total year
ended December 31, 2021 to €4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and were primarily related to
strengthening of the online platform.

Merger and comparability across periods, see “—Key Factors Affecting Comparability—2021 Acquisition and 2022 Reverse Merger” and
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”

As of December 31, 2023, after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Transactions and the Offering, the principal
amount of our total external net debt would have been €1,628.7 million. Our indebtedness levels may have
important negative consequences for noteholders. See “Risk Factors.” There are also limitations on our ability to
obtain additional debt financing. See “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements.” Further, any additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow_
available to make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including under the Notes offered hereby.

Our primary sources of cash will be cash flows from operating activities and borrowing under our debt facilities
including the Revolving Credit Facility, and we may from time to time issue debt securities or obtain other debt
financing. Our principal uses of cash have been, and we expect it will continue to be, operating expenses, capital
expenditure, working capital requirements, acquisitions and debt service payments. As of December 31, 2023,
our cash and cash equivalents amounted to €170.4 million, and we had €76.3 million in undrawn amounts
available in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

We believe that, based on our current level of operations, our cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities
and the availability of borrowings under our debt facilities, including the Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service payments for at least the
next twelve months.

-----

Our Net Working Capital trend is mainly driven by trade receivables and deferred revenues, with peaks at the
end of the year due to the tuition fees accounting policy applied by the Group. In particular, when a student
enrolls, the Group books accounts receivables for the total amount to be collected against deferred revenues
(reflecting the total amount of tuition fees remaining for the academic year), which is then released on a monthly
basis to profits and losses. Consequently, Net Working Capital is exposed to business seasonality with peaks in
September, due to current students' enrollment renewal occurring at the beginning of the academic year, and in
the fourth quarter, due to the peak of deferred revenues mirroring new students’ enrollment concentration in the
months of October and November, along with the collection of current students’ first installment of tuition fees
in November. See “—Critical Accounting Policies—Receivables.” In the year ended December 31, 2023,
Multiversity changed the payment conditions applied to ELCPs, reducing them from 90 to 30 days, and allowed
tuition to now be paid in eight installments rather than quarterly, both of which are expected to lead to a more
linear trend in Net Working Capital going forward.

(Negative) Net Working Capital amounted to €(45.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared
to €(33.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily driven by the increase in
receivables of €37.9 mainly related to the increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in net accruals and
deferrals of €30.6 million due to deferred income related to tuition and fees of students who had applied for
enrollment in the universities of the Group for the 2023/2024 academic year and an increase in trade and other
payables of €20.0 million.

(Negative) Net Working Capital amounted to €(33.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared
to €(46.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change was primarily driven by an increase in
trade receivables by €57.8 million due to increase in receivables from students and new payment terms, and
partially offset by tax and security payables and payables to suppliers.

**Contractual Obligations**

Multiversity has no off-balance sheet agreements other than (i) the framework agreement relating to the
acquisition of a majority stake in Aulab, which provides for reciprocal options between the buyer and seller with
reference to the shares held by the minority shareholders, to be exercised in two different time windows
according to contractually defined calculation mechanisms based on financial results, and (ii) the Group’s stock
option plan and long term incentives plan. See Note 6.8 of the 2023/2022 Consolidated Financial Statements.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

The Group activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including credit risk and liquidity risk. The risk
management policy, which is managed centrally by the senior management, focuses on minimizing the potential
adverse effects on our financial performance. The following section discusses the significant financial risks to
which the Group is exposed. This discussion does not address any other risks to which it is exposed to in the
normal course of business such as operational risks. See “Risk Factors.”

**_Interest rate risk_**

The Group will be subject to interest rate market risk in connection with its long-term debt. The Group’s
principal interest rate exposure will relate to variable rate borrowings under the Existing Notes and the Floating
Rate Notes. To the extent that EURIBOR is in excess of the 0.00% floor rate, each one basis point change in
interest rates would result in an approximately €     change in annual interest expense on the funded
indebtedness under the Floating Rate Notes, assuming the Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn.

**_Credit risk_**

Following the credit monitoring activity carried out on a timely basis by the administrative offices of the group
companies, overdue credit collection activities are constantly implemented, including by strengthening the
administrative staff. The value of the receivables is constantly monitored during the year, and if needed a
provision for the estimated uncollectable receivable is accrued so that the amount expresses the presumed
realisable value.

**_Liquidity Risk and Risk of Changes in Cash Flows_**

Our management body constantly monitors the trends in cash flows through an adequate financial planning
system and any extraordinary funding, also in the context of extraordinary operations, is made after a deep and
prudent liquidity risk analysis. After the Transactions are executed, a certain portion of our cash flows will be
absorbed by the repayment of principles and interests of the borrowings entered into in connection with the 2021
Acquisition.

**_Tax risk_**

All Group companies monitor their tax position on an ongoing basis and implement risk management associated
with prudent tax policies, and with the help of external consultants. On January 12, 2024, a tax audit was
commenced by the Italian Tax Police (Guardia di Finanza) against Pegaso (see “Business—Litigation and legal,
_tax and administrative proceedings”)._

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum contain a description of certain
significant accounting policies of Multiversity S.p.A. which require the Group to make estimates and
assumptions that affect reported results and disclosures. The Group believes the following items are critical
accounting policies. “Critical accounting policies” means policies that are both important to the portrayal of the
Group’s financial performance and financial results, and that require critical management judgments and
estimates in relation to matters that are inherently uncertain. The estimates and assumptions are based on
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are used to
judge the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The most critical accounting policies involving a
higher degree of judgment and complexity in applying principles of valuation and for which changes in the
assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results than those recorded in the financial
statements included elsewhere in the Offering Memorandum. Although we believe that our discretionary
judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from our estimates.

**_Write-downs for impairment of tangible and intangible assets_**

At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indicator to suggest a fixed asset may have
suffered impairment. If these indicators were to exist, the Group would estimate the recoverable value of the


-----

asset by making a write-down only if the latter were lower than the corresponding net book value. In the
absence of indicators of potential impairment, the recoverable value is not determined.

When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the Group estimates the
recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and its value in use determined
as the present value of estimated future cash flows.

An impairment is recognized if the recoverable value is lower than the book value. When, subsequently, a loss
on assets, other than goodwill, ceases or is reduced, the book value of the asset or the cash-generating unit is
increased up to the new estimate of the recoverable value without exceeding the value that would have been
determined if no loss had been detected.

**_Receivables_**

Receivables originating from revenues for the sale of goods or the provision of services are recognized under
current assets on an accrual basis when the conditions for the recognition of the related revenues are met.

The revenue recognition policy is set out below.

Most of the revenues are deferred on the basis of the academic year which starts on August 1 and ends on July
31 of the following year, calculating the actual days.

Revenues deriving from “OLD” undergraduate students (students already enrolled in the previous year) are
accounted for at the beginning of the new academic year (August 1) and deferred through the entire period (until
July 31).

Revenues deriving from “NEW” undergraduate students (new students enrolled) are spread evenly between the
enrollment date and the end of the relevant academic year. For new undergraduate students enrolled between
August and December, revenues are recognized starting from the enrollment date and deferred in equal monthly
installments for the remainder of the academic year. For example, if a student enrolls in August (the beginning
of the academic year), revenue accrues monthly in 12 equal installments for the remainder of the academic year,
with 5/12 of the tuition fee (representing five months) recognized in the year of enrolment and 7/12 of the
tuition fee (representing seven months) recognized in the next financial year. If a student enrolls in October,
revenue accrues monthly in 10 equal installments for the duration of the academic year, with 3/10 of the tuition
fee (representing three months) recognized in the year of enrolment and 7/10 of the tuition fee (representing
seven months) recognized in the next financial year. For new undergraduate students enrolled between January
and July, revenues are fully recognized in the related financial year, with no revenues accrued in the previous
financial year.

FIT revenues are not deferred on the basis of the academic years but according to the following percentages:
50% / 25% / 25% respectively in the accounting month and in the following 2 months. Starting from October
2022, FIT revenues are no longer considered to be a revenue stream due to a change in regulation.

The other types of revenue are directly accounted for in the billing month and therefore are not deferred (as for
EIPASS revenues).

Receivables originating for different reasons are recognized if there is a ‘title’ to the receivable and therefore
when they actually represent a third-party obligation to the company; if of a financial nature they are classified
under financial fixed assets, with an indication of the portion due within the next fiscal year.

Receivables are valued in the financial statements at amortized cost, taking into account the time factor, and
within the limits of their presumed realisable value and, therefore, are shown in the balance sheet net of the
related bad debt provision deemed adequate to cover losses due to reasonably foreseeable non-collectability.

If the interest rate of the transaction is not significantly different from the market rate, the receivable is initially
recorded at a value equal to the nominal value net of all premiums, discounts, rebates and inclusive of any costs
directly attributable to the transaction, which generated the receivable. These transaction costs, any commission


-----

income and expense and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are spread
over the duration of the loan using the effective interest criterion.

On the other hand, when the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is
significantly different from the market rate, the receivable (and the corresponding revenue in the case of
commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows plus any
transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate.

In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the
present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognized under financial
income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the
transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest
income accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income
statement with the value of the receivable as a contra entry.

The value of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the amounts received, both by way of principal and
interest, as well as for any write-downs to bring the receivables back to their presumed realisable value or for
losses.

The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortized cost and the discounting back
are not relevant when the maturity of the receivables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the
contractual and substantial considerations in place on recognition of the receivable, and the transaction costs and
any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity is of an insignificant amount. In this
case, discounting was omitted, the interest was calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs were
entered among deferrals and amortized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the receivable to adjust the
nominal interest income.

**_Provisions for risks and charges_**

They are set aside to cover losses or debts of certain or probable existence, whose amount or date of occurrence
could not be determined at the end of the year.

In the measurement of these provisions, the general criteria of prudence and accrual accounting are respected,
and no provision was made for generic risks without economic justification.

Contingent liabilities are recognized in the financial statements and booked under provisions when they are
likely to materialise and when the amount of the related charge can be reasonably estimated.

Any risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible or for which no objective forecast of the
resulting charge is possible are indicated in the explanatory notes of the financial statements without allocating
provisions for risks and charges.

Risks whose probability of occurrence appears remote are not taken into account.

**_Income taxes—Current, Prepaid and Deferred_**

Current income taxes are allocated according to the accrual principle on the basis of the tax charges resulting
from the application of the tax legislation in force and are entered among tax payables net of advances.

Deferred and prepaid taxes are determined on the temporary differences between the value attributed to the
assets and liabilities according to statutory criteria and the value attributed to the same assets and liabilities for
tax purposes.

Deferred taxes are entered in the ‘Provision for deferred taxes’, recorded under liabilities among the provisions
for risks and charges, while the prepaid taxes are recorded in the receivables from others under current assets.

Assets deriving from prepaid taxes are not recognized, in compliance with the prudence principle, if there is no
reasonable certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be
reversed, of a taxable income higher than the amount of the differences that will be cancelled. Liabilities for
deferred taxes are recognized only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will reverse in the foreseeable


-----

future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year
in which the tax asset will be realised or the tax liability will be settled, based on the tax legislation established
by the provisions in force at the reporting date.

**_Accruals and deferrals_**

The portions of costs and income common to two or more fiscal years, according to the matching and accrual
basis, are recorded in these items. Based on this criterion, accruals or deferrals are recognized when the
following conditions are met:

- the contract begins in one fiscal year and ends in a subsequent one;

- the consideration for the services is contractually due in advance or in arrears with respect to services
common to two or more consecutive years;

- the amount of accruals and deferrals varies with the passage of time.

Income and charges that have accrued in full in the fiscal year to which the financial statements refer or in
subsequent ones are not included among accruals and deferrals.

**Global higher education market has shown attractive and resilient growth supported by solid structural**
**fundamentals that have been further accelerated by private spend and online penetration**

The global base of students enrolled in higher education increased from 83 million students in 1996 to over 250
million in 2022 showing a resilient 4% compound annual growth (despite several economic downturns) and
backed by solid structural fundamentals such as total population growth and share of enrolled population in
higher education. Notably, global higher education enrollment showed a 13% growth through the dot-com
bubble (1998 to 2000) and over 20% growth through the global financial crisis (2008 to 2010).

**Number of Students enrolled[52] in Higher Education Worldwide[53]** (1996-2022 | million)

Some of the key structural tailwinds in global higher education include (i) a widening gap between supply and
demand of the skills in the employment market, (ii) the need for more career-relevant degrees and (iii) the
increased relevance of lifelong learning and reskilling in the job market.

There is a tangible increasing demand globally for a highly educated workforce largely driven by a continuously
evolving technological landscape. In particular, the growing and accelerated need for digital skills is fuelling
demand for continuous learning and upskilling especially in constantly evolving areas of the market such as
“industry 4.0” roles (i.e., robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence). Furthermore, and as a consequence
of the job market evolution, experienced workers are increasingly demanding continuous learning opportunities
to remain up to date in their current careers displaying a desire for learning opportunities that are self-directed,
affordable and accessible.

There have been two clearly identified vectors that have contributed to the accelerated growth of the higher
education market globally: (i) global population growth, (ii) private spend growth and (iii) development of
online education alternatives. Over the past decade the financial constraints of certain governments to cater for
incremental education needs of the population, have resulted in increased private spending in higher education
which contributed to the expansion of higher education offerings and enhanced accessibility. As a result, the
global private higher education market grew from 70 million students in 2014 to 80 million in 2021, showing a
compound annual growth rate above 3%.

Another key growth vector for the higher education market globally has been the positive evolution in online
penetration. Growth has been supported by a strong development of the technology associated with the delivery
format of the courses and an improving perception of online degrees. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has
further accelerated an ongoing trend of change in learning behaviours which are anticipated to have a lasting
effect on demand for more accessible and affordable higher education options. As a result, online penetration in
education globally has increased from 15% in the 2015/2016 academic year to over 25% in the 2020/2021
academic year.

**Online Penetration – Selected Reference**
**Markets[55] (%)**


**The Italian higher education market has historically demonstrated stable growth which in recent years**
**has been accelerated by online enrollments, yet graduate penetration is still well below other nations in**
**Europe due to a number of structural challenges**

The Italian higher education market is broad and developed, home to some of the oldest universities ever
established. In Italy as of the 2021/2022 academic year there are 68[56] public universities mostly located in major
urban areas. These do not have admission tests, except for specific courses (such as medicine and architecture)
and as of 2023 have average annual tuition fees of approximately €1,600[57], depending on a students’ immediate
family’s wealth. There are 20 private physical universities in Italy, with higher average tuition fees
(approximately €4,600[6] in 2023) and mostly with an admission test and/or criteria based on students’ academic
performance in high school. Online universities in Italy represent a smaller segment of 11 universities, with no
admission test (also driven by the fact that there are no limitations associated with physical space availability)

and with average annual tuition of approximately €2,300[6 ] for the same period. The Italian university market,
initially closed to online universities, was officially opened to online competition in 2003 (but only started
operating in 2006).

Similar to the global higher education market, the Italian market has shown resiliency to economic and financial
shocks maintaining a stable trend throughout the great financial crisis, EU debt crisis and the COVID-19 crisis.
The number of enrolled undergraduate university students in Italy increased from 1.8 million in the 2006/2007
academic year to 1.9 million in the 2022/2023 academic year. This was mainly driven by the online university
segment which over the same period increased by approximately 20% compound annual growth.

**Italian Undergraduate University Enrolled Students[58] (Academic year 2006/2007–2022/2023 | thousand**
students)

Despite the enrollment improvement in recent years driven by increased willingness to study (with willingness
to pursue university among high school graduates in Italy in particular increasing by 6 percentage points from
68% in 2015 to 74% in 2021[59]) and availability of appealing job opportunities which require higher education
qualification (70% average income increase in 2022 in the 18-64 age population in Italy with tertiary
education[60] in comparison to base education[61] which is in line with other developed countries[62]), Italy still
remains the OECD country with the lowest tertiary education penetration among its population aged 25-34 years
old (29% in 2020[63]). This represents a significant gap compared to the EU average of 44% and other
comparable countries in Europe (UK at 56%, France at 49%, and Spain at 47% in 2020).

**Percentage of graduates within 25-34 age range by country[12]** (2020 | %)

Unlike other countries, Italy also has a considerably lower share of university students who are satisfied with
their life overall (62%), a sizeable gap compared with other developed (approximately 70-75%) and developing
countries (approximately 76-82%) as of 2018[64]. In addition, the share of students considering dropping out of
university is elevated in Italy at 36%, in contrast with other developed countries, approximately 30-35%, and
developing countries, approximately 8-20%[13] over the same period. Overall, this has resulted in the lowest share
of bachelor’s degree students in Italy who completed any tertiary level education on time, at 21% in contrast
with 48% average of France, Spain, the U.S. and the U.K. One of the main reasons behind the gap, according to
students, is that the learning experience in university in Italy is perceived as difficult and with low practical
applications due to certain structural challenges in the physical university system.

**Share of bachelor’s degree students who completed any tertiary level program[65] in time[66] and within 3**
**years[67] after end of program[68]** (2022 | %)

The Italian physical university structural issues are attributable to (i) a population fragmented into many smallmedium urban areas, only a portion of which host an in-person university, which results in university attendance
being expensive and cumbersome for students working at the same time, (ii) the Italian public university system
having sizable gaps in terms of fundings and agility to innovate and (iii) the outdated and highly theoretical
approach of physical universities leading to students’ dissatisfaction and longer time for graduation.

Online universities addressed the structural issues of physical universities and, as a result, significantly
increased their relevance in the market, representing 14% of the total undergraduate population in Italy with
approximately 262,000 enrolled students in the 2022/2023 academic year, a significant growth from 4% in the
2015/2016 academic year and even more remarkable when considering that this channel did not exist prior to

2006[69]. The higher growth of online universities is driven by their ability to address students’ needs related to
flexibility and time savings, more exams sessions (which prevents delays that could otherwise interrupt career
progression) and cost savings[70].

**Online versus physical university full cost per student[71] – Bachelor’s (€ thousands)[727374]**

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated undergraduate penetration of the online offering in Italy from 8% in the
2019/2020 academic year to 12% in the 2021/2022 academic year (2 percentage points per annum)[75]. However,
the growth continued strongly after the COVID-19 period demonstrating a further 2 percentage points growth
from the 2021/2022 academic year to 14% penetration in the 2022/2023 academic year with growth expected to
continue in the future[24] (see “Online universities are expected to continue driving growth in the Italian higher
_education market” below)._

**Clear regulatory endorsement of online universities in Italy and the competitive landscape of the Italian**
**online higher education market today**

Online universities were created in Italy upon the regulatory endorsement to fill the structural gap of the
physical university system. On April 17, 2003, the Italian University Education and Research Ministry, together
with the Minister for Innovation and Technology, opened the higher education market to online universities, in
an effort to increase the number of people holding a higher education degree and offer a more flexible and
affordable path to students in comparison with physical universities while granting degrees of equal legal value.

Since the opening of the online Italian higher education market in 2003, 11 private online universities were
established, with online universities enrolling their first students in 2006. The online university market is
structurally closed to new entrants, as no further licenses are currently expected to be issued. In particular, the
restriction for the establishment of online universities in Italy is usually extended every three years, with the
publication of the Ministerial Decree governing Italian universities’ academic planning. The latest Ministerial

Decree published in March 2021 (Decree n. 289 of March 25, 2021) confirmed the restriction until the
2023/2024 academic year. The provisions of the decree shall apply until the ministerial decree establishing the
general guidelines for the 2024-2026 academic period is issued, which as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum is still under discussion before the competent ministry. Online higher education activities are
subject to extensive regulation and must obtain and maintain several authorizations. Individual courses are
subject to various accreditation requirements from the MIUR in order for them to carry the same legal
recognition as courses offered from a traditional university. Courses also must undergo a review process with
the MIUR every three years with institutions undergoing review every five years in order to maintain licensing.
Additionally, starting from the 2021/2022 academic year, online universities were required to reduce their
student to faculty ratio by approximately a third pursuant to DM 2021, further increasing barriers for smaller
competitors who lack the resources to increase their teaching staff.

Multiversity, which encompasses three of the fastest growing online universities (Pegaso, Mercatorum, and San
Raffaelle), has quickly become the largest university group in Italy (including physical and online) with enrolled
students reaching approximately 151,000 in the 2022/2023 academic year (+32% compound annual growth rate
from the 2018/2019 academic year to 2022/2023). Despite the strong recent growth, Multiversity still accounts
for only 8% of the market share in the 2022/2023 academic year in a highly fragmented market of 99
universities in Italy.

**Top Italian universities by number of enrolled students[76]** (academic year 2022/2023 | thousand students)

**Online universities are expected to continue driving growth in the Italian higher education market**

Online universities in Italy have activated a demand for higher education that was formerly unmet through
attracting students that would have otherwise not enrolled in higher education.

The overall enrolled undergraduate base in Italy is expected to grow from approximately 2.0 million in the
2023/2024 academic year to about 2.3 million in the 2027/2028 academic year, representing a compound annual
growth rate of about 4%. Over the same period, the online market is expected to grow on average 15% annually,
reaching approximately 0.6 million enrolled students by the 2027/2028 academic year, while the physical
enrollments are expected to grow at a more modest pace of about 1% per year. This would represent a notable
increase of 8 percentage points in online penetration, reaching 24% penetration in the 2027/2028 academic year
from 16% penetration in the 2023/2024 academic year.

**Online penetration forecast[78]** (academic year

Despite the growing market, the overall higher education penetration of 25–34-year-olds in Italy is only
expected to reach 32-35% by 2028, well below the most recent average estimate for the European Union at
44%[79]. This represents a significant gap of approximately 10 percentage points compared to peer countries
providing room for further potential growth for the higher education market in Italy.

**Online higher education is expected to continue activating untapped demand in Italy, with online student**
**inflows projected to grow, supported by positive trends across all student categories**

The Italian online higher education market is expected to grow its inflows at an annual rate of about 13%
between the academic years 2023/2024 and 2027/2028. In total this would add approximately 700,000 students
to the online student base, which would be partly offset by expected graduates and churn of about 450,000[80].

Some of the key drivers for the demand for university graduates in the job market in Italy include increased
professionalization of the small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”), as well as increasing requirements for
degrees in both public administration roles and for independent professionals. There is a rapid
professionalization trend in SMEs, as of 2021 representing 53% of the Italian working population, resulting in
high demand for university graduates. Public administration roles, which make up 12% of the Italian working
population, are increasingly either requiring or ascribing higher value to having a university degree for the same
period[81]. In addition, independent professionals who currently represents 19% of the Italian working population
are increasingly incentivized (driven by higher compensation and career progression) to have a higher education
degree[82].

In order to account for differences in student profiles when forecasting future growth, students can be grouped
in the following categories.

**Students’ profile** **Description**

New bachelor / single-cycle university students who have never been enrolled at

university before and that are 20 years old or younger

Students enrolling after the age of 20 that can be divided into three sub-categories:

1. **Late adopters: New bachelor / single-cycle university students who have never**
been enrolled at university before and which are 21 years old or older

**Latecomers**

2. **Returns: Students who enroll again after having dropped-out the studies**

3. **Transfers: Students who were previously enrolled at other physical**
universities

**1[st] Year MSc** New students who enroll to the 1st year of MSc

Students who are already enrolled in a program either in a physical or online

**Double Degree** university at bachelor, MSc, or post-graduate level, and opting to simultaneously

enroll in a second program

The growing inflows in the Italian online university market are supported by growth across these student
categories with the majority to be driven by the latecomer category which is expected to account for about 62%
of the inflows in the 2023/2024 academic year, followed by 1[st] year MSc (25%), and freshmen (11%), and the
double degree students (2%).

The double degree students represent a new category of students in the market, enabled by the double degree
law, which was approved in April 2022 (Law 12 April 2022, n. 33) and allows students who are already enrolled
in a university (physical or online) degree to enroll in a second degree simultaneously. According to MIUR, dual
enrollment should be facilitated by universities and is permitted as long as the two degrees do not belong to the
same class and to medical specialization courses, and are not the same undergraduate, graduate, or master’s
degree at two different universities. The 2022/2023 academic year was the first year such dual enrollment was
permitted. As such, double degree student inflows are expected to grow from a relatively small inflow today to
making up 6% of the total undergraduate student inflows by the 2027/2028 academic year, representing a
compound annual growth rate of 55%. Freshmen inflows are expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of
15% during this period, supported by a higher share of the population graduating high-school and the increased
willingness to go to university, as well as higher interest in attending university online. Latecomers continue to
grow on the back of higher interest in online universities and the continued increase in the share of the
population willing to pay over €1,000 per year for attending online university. Overall, the latecomer inflows are
expected to grow at compound annual rate of 13% during this period. Finally, the 1[st] year MSc students are
supported by a steadily increasing number of graduates from bachelor courses and a stable outlook for the share
of graduates continuing with MSc programs.

Growth across all categories is driven by a continued increase in the activation rate (the share of the potential
market that eventually ends up enrolling in an online university). Overall, the total undergraduate student

(“Mercatorum”) and Università Telematica San Raffaele Roma S.r.l. (“San Raffaele”). It provides a
student centric proposition with a wide array of undergraduate and post graduate courses to
approximately 206,000 students for the 2022/2023 academic year and is supported by a strong
professor base (10 Multiversity professors have been included in the “Top Scientists – World Top 2%”
ranking from Stanford University). Degrees awarded at the end of academic courses have the same
legal value as degrees issued by traditional universities. 97.4% of Multiversity’s revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2023 was generated by the university segment.

  - Non-academic courses and certifications: Multiversity has also expanded into a complementary nonuniversity education segment, mainly focusing on: (i) B2B and B2C executive education through Sole
24 Ore Formazione S.p.A. (“Sole 24 Ore Formazione”), (ii) digital skills through Aulab S.r.l.
(“Aulab”), a coding factory, which delivers short term courses for software developers, and (iii) a
certification entity, Certipass S.r.l. (“Certipass”). 2.3% of Multiversity’s revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2023 was generated by the non-academic education segment.

  - Other assets: Multiversity also operates a number of academies offering courses on specific subjects
(e.g. communication, marketing and law) as well as other assets (e.g. Principe di Napoli, which
provides gastronomy and tourism higher education, or Benecon, a research center promoted by the
Campania Region). 0.3% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were
generated by the other assets segment.

Multiversity delivers its services through a proprietary online platform that produces its e-learning content,
which is developed in-house. In addition, Multiversity is also a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in
education, in particular for marketing purposes and for the development of new use cases (such as its Tutor
Chatbot and Exam Generator applications).

**_Online universities_**

Pegaso is Multiversity’s largest university. Approximately 140,000 students were enrolled in Pegaso’s online
courses for the 2022/2023 academic year. Pegaso offers a range of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses,
and in particular eight undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single cycle fiveyear degree and 158 courses, including postgraduate master’s courses and higher education and specialization
courses for professionals and high school graduates. Pegaso also offers individual certifications and gives
students the possibility to undertake single examinations for each course module upon payment of a fee without
having to complete the full course.

Multiversity’s second key institution, Mercatorum, is 66.67% owned by Multiversity, with the remaining
33.33% stake held by Unioncamere, the Italian Union of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and
Agriculture, which is the public body that unifies and institutionally represents the Italian system of chambers of

commerce. Approximately 53,000 students were enrolled in Mercatorum for the 2022/2023 academic year.
Mercatorum’s core offering consists of 14 undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees,
five Ph.D. programs and 121 courses, including postgraduate master’s courses and higher education and
specialization courses for professionals and high school graduates.

Multiversity’s third primary institution in terms of revenue, San Raffaele, became part of the Group in 2022, and
it is wholly owned by Multiversity. San Raffaele delivers courses mainly related to biomedical and healthcare
sciences, and it ranks first in research quality among digital universities and fifth among the entire national
university system.[87] Approximately 13,000 students were enrolled in San Raffaele for the 2022/2023 academic
year, and its core offering currently consists of four undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, three specialist master’s
degrees, six Ph.D. programs and 39 postgraduate master’s courses.

**_Non-academic courses and certifications_**

In relation to the non-university education segment, Multiversity operates Sole 24 Ore Formazione in
partnership with Il Sole 24 Ore S.p.A. (with Multiversity holding a majority stake of 85%) to deliver B2B and
B2C executive master's courses to professionals and young graduates. As part of the B2B offerings, Multiversity
also offers compulsory courses, soft skills, industry and managerial training to corporates. These courses can be
offered as off-the shelf, co-designed or fully customized. The B2B courses can vary in length, while the B2C
courses typically last one to six months. The new partnership benefits from a top level academic and scientific
training offer, thanks to the support of the universities that are part of the Group as well as the support and the
strong brand recognition of the Il Sole 24 Ore group (owning the 15% of Sole 24 Ore Formazione), one of the
leading finance newspapers in Italy, which provides content to readers, professionals, businesses, and
institutions on topics of economics, finance, and management. Additionally, Multiversity owns 60.61% of
Aulab, a player in the digital training sector for developers with a high placement rate of its students thanks to
an effective training model for coding and IT education, an efficient placement platform and partnerships with
top companies. This training model requires no pre-requisites and typically lasts from three to 6 months. In
addition to training, Aulab also designs and develops websites, IT platforms and software applications. The nonuniversity segment also includes Certipass, a provider of international EIPASS certifications for digital
competences and IT skills.

**_Academies and other assets_**

The Group also includes a number of academies established through collaboration agreements between Pegaso,
Mercatorum and San Raffaele and their respective commercial partners, covering a wide range of specialist
subjects such as marketing, communications and media and teaching. Other assets include Principe di Napoli
S.a.r.l. (“Principe di Napoli”), established in February 2019 by Pegaso in partnership with Mercatorum
(holding 90% and 10% stakes, respectively) as a center for higher education and specialization in the sectors of
gastronomy and tourism. Apart from the Postgraduate School in Legal Professions (as further described below),
Principe di Napoli is one of the few institution within Multiversity to hold on premise courses. Additionally, in
December 2023, the Group acquired a minority stake in Materias S.r.l., an incubator of scientific research
activities engaged in identifying innovative ideas in the field of advanced materials, primarily generated from
the academic sector.

Multiversity also operates a publishing entity and companies dedicated to research, which are mostly ancillary
and in support of the three universities. Almost the entirety of its operations are located in Italy, with some
limited operations in Malta (Pegaso International). It also has collaboration agreements with several partners in
Italy for the development and delivery of specialized courses in a multitude of subjects, made available through
its three universities.

In order to support their online offering, Multiversity’s institutions have an extensive network of approximately
1,000[88] e-learning center points (the “ELCPs”) as of December 31, 2023. The ELCPs provide information to
prospective and current students about the various institutions and serve as orientation centers for new students
throughout the entire duration of the course they undertake. The ELCP Points performed orientation activities
for approximately 61% of Multiversity’s institution’s new students as of December 31, 2023; however, the
relevant institution retains the direct relationship with student as it manages the enrollment process and tuition

fee payments directly with the student[89]. As regards the ELCP Points across Certipass, these purchase EIPASS
cards from Certipass and on-sell them to customers who wish to obtain an EIPASS certification. All ELCPs are
managed by external third parties that have entered into specific accreditation agreements with Pegaso,
Mercatorum, San Raffaele or Certipass (in some cases, more than one institution has entered into an
accreditation agreement with the same ELCP). See “Material Contracts—Accreditation agreements for ELCPs”
below.

**_Financial Performance_**

Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to €419.9 million, as
compared to €332.0 million for the prior financial year ended December 31, 2022 (an increase of 26.5%).
Enrolled undergraduate students at Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele increased by approximately 28% in
the 2022/2023 academic year with respect to the 2021/2022 academic year.

In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generated for the year ended December 31, 2023 was €247.2 million as
compared to €200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (an increase of 23.6%). Adjusted EBITDA
margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 58.9%, as compared to 60.2% for the year ended December
31, 2022.

Furthermore, Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow generated for the year ended December 31, 2023 was €226.0
million, as compared to €157.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (an increase of 43%). Adjusted
Cash Conversion for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 91%, as compared to 79% for the year ended
December 31, 2022 (an increase of 12%).

**_Business Model_**

Multiversity’s business model is based on a student-centric offering of a flexible learning experience and access
to teaching content through its proprietary and technologically advanced e-learning platform. Multiversity’s
universities address specific unmet demand in the market for a flexible path to an undergraduate degree, whilst
catering to specific professions for postgraduate continuous learning.

Revenues are mainly driven by tuition fees paid by students, which contributed to 75%[90] of Multiversity’s
revenues. Almost the entirety of tuition fees is self-funded by students, with less than 1% paid through
scholarships. The levels of tuition fees in turn depend on the number of students, the nature or class of degree
undertaken, the year of enrollment, the type of course and the student’s selected enrollment channel, amongst
other factors. Undergraduate degrees, which are multi-year courses (three-year bachelor’s degree plus a twoyear specialist master’s degree, or a single-cycle five-year degree), are a recurring multi-year revenue stream for
the term of the program (consisting of both the tuition fees and any other ancillary fees), which has an average
course length of approximately 2.4 years. Approximately 30% of Multiversity's graduates who have completed
three-year undergraduate degree courses wish to continue their education and apply to enroll in two-year
specialist master’s degree and master’s degree courses with the same institution.

On the other hand, one-year postgraduate courses (i.e. second level master’s which may be undertaken by
students who have already completed a three year undergraduate bachelor’s degree plus a two year specialist
master’s degree or a single-cycle five year degree), together with higher education courses and specialization
courses, provide a one-off tuition fee payment per student, accounting for 6% of Multiversity’s revenues for the
financial year ended December 31, 2023. Various other services offered to students provide additional revenue
such as fees payable in order to take examinations in an alternative location, and certificates; such additional
services accounted for approximately 14% of Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31,
2023. Single exams contributed to 1% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. The
non-academic business segment (including Certipass, Aulab and Sole 24 Ore Formazione) accounted for
approximately 2% of Multiversity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The other assets segment (which include Principe di Napoli, Benecon and other smaller companies) accounted
for 0.3% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.

89 With reference to the 2022/2023 academic year.

90 Excluding any fees payable by students for ancillary services, such as supplemental tuition fee or the alternative exam location
fee.


-----

With respect to student orientation, around 61% of new students as of December 31, 2023 (contributing to 62%
of commercial revenues for the 2022/2023 academic year) across Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele partook
in orientation activities at the approximately 1,000 ELCPs that make up Multiversity’s national network.
Approximately 39% of students as of December 31, 2023 (contributing to 38% of commercial revenues for the
2022/2023 academic year) were reached through traditional marketing methods, e.g. billboards and TV
advertising campaigns on both private and public Italian channels, as well as through its extensive online
presence on social media and online advertising, thereby gaining access to the widest possible audience and
delivering tangible results, with an increase in new leads of 50% in 2023 compared to 2022. Multiversity has
established a nation-wide presence, with approximately 100 exam venues located in prestigious and historical
buildings, along with a strong online social community and proprietary technology platforms for online classes,
exams and tutoring.

Multiversity’s growth strategy is predominantly based on expanding volumes by increasing market penetration
within the population, whilst selectively increasing its course offering, its brand awareness, digital marketing
practices and _ad hoc_ orientation services to prospective students as well as by entering into commercial
agreements and partnerships.

Additionally, revenues are driven by increases in our tuition fees taking into account inflation and other
commercial considerations. For example, Multiversity increased its undergraduate tuition fees for newly
enrolling students by approximately 8% on average for the 2022/2023 academic year, as compared to the prior
academic year. See further “—Competitive Strengths” and “Business Strategy” below.

The main objective underpinning Multiversity’s business strategy is to consolidate its market position and
strengthen its position as the leading entirely online education group in the Italian market, employing both
Business-to-Consumer and Business-to-Business marketing strategies in order to target an ever-wider audience
of students. See further “—Competitive Strengths” and “—Business Strategy” below.

**Competitive Strengths**

**Multiversity operates in the sizeable Italian higher education market which is highly attractive due to its**
**structurally low graduate penetration, providing online universities an opportunity to fill the education**
**deficit**

Multiversity benefits from operating in the sizeable Italian higher education market (1.9 million undergraduate
students in Italy across online and traditional universities for the 2022/2023 academic year compared to 1.8
million undergraduate students for the 2020/2021 academic year)[91], where graduate penetration lags behind
other European countries. University graduate penetration[92] in Italy stood at only 29% in 2020 (increasing from
25% in 2015), compared to 44% on average for the EU, 56% for the U.K., 49% for France, 47% for Spain and
35% for Germany for the same period.[93] This low penetration is due to a number of structural factors in Italy
described further below, the combination of which allows online universities such as Multiversity to fill the
education deficit.

Accessibility to physical universities in Italy remains challenging due to a number of factors, including (i) a high
geographic dispersion of the population in Italy when compared to other major European countries, with 52% of
Italians living in non-metropolitan areas[94] (compared to an average of 29% for Spain, the U.K., France and
Germany)[95] and 77% living in municipalities with 100,000 or fewer inhabitants[96] as of 2022; and (ii) a high
concentration of physical universities in Italy in larger cities, leaving 52%[97] of provinces in Italy without a
physical university.[98]

The gap in public expenditure is aggravated by a student housing deficit that creates significant cost pressure on
students who study outside of their hometown (which represents 46% of the 1.9 million undergraduate student
population in Italy for the 2022/2023 academic year)[100], with only between 8-10% of off-campus housing
demand in 2023 covered by public and private student housing (significantly lower than an average of
approximately 20% of demand covered in the EU)[101], resulting in a total cost of education (including rent costs,
tuition, food and learning materials) that is around 58-72% of the median disposable income in Italy of
approximately 23,000 as of 2023[102].

Further, the physical university education system in Italy (including its curriculum and teaching methodology) is
considered by many to be outdated and broadly disconnected from students’ needs in terms of content, delivery
and flexibility. In 2018, Italy had the lowest student satisfaction rate compared to other developed[103] or
developing[104] countries (62% in Italy compared to 76-82% in developing countries and 70-75% in the
developed countries for the same period).[105] 57% of students in Italy as of 2018 who dropped out cited studyrelated issues as their reason for leaving[106].[107] Overall, these factors and the other limitations mentioned above
contribute to significantly lower graduation success rates in Italy compared to other countries, with only 21% of
graduate students[108] in Italy in 2022 graduating on time and 53% graduating within three years of the end of

These structural reasons for low penetration and incentives to pursue higher education create an opportunity for
online universities to bridge the sizable gap by eliminating the need for relocation and reducing the total cost of
higher education while providing flexible and quality education. Online university enrollment in Italy now
captures approximately 13.7% of total higher education enrollment in Italy for the 2022/2023 academic year,
increasing from approximately 10.4% for the 2020/2021 academic year, as students move towards digital
delivery, with students reporting higher overall rates of satisfaction at online universities such as Multiversity,
along with better retention and on time graduation.[110] See “—Multiversity is the leading online education
_platform in Europe and Italy, with a fit for purpose value proposition, providing legally equivalent education_
_with strong placement outcomes at an attractive pricing.” The addressable market[111] in Italy is also_
underpenetrated, large, and growing, standing at approximately 1 million students in 2019 and 1.5 million
students in 2023.

**_Government endorsement of online education in Italy to fill the structural gap through a limited number of_**
**_degree awarding licenses and extensive regulation_**

In order to make higher education more accessible to a wider share of population, the Italian government opened
the Italian higher education market to online competition in 2003, effectively creating a public-private
partnership to help address the structural gap. In an effort to keep the quality of education elevated, only eleven
online university licenses with full degree awarding power have been awarded thus far and as a consequence no
additional licenses have been granted since 2006. The restriction for the establishment of online universities in
Italy is usually extended every 3 years through the publication of ministerial decrees, the latest of which
confirmed the restriction until the 2023/2024 academic year. This provides a stable regulatory environment and
strong tailwinds for incumbent online universities such as Multiversity.

At the same time, Multiversity’s activities are also subject to extensive regulation and obtaining and maintaining
authorizations which can be onerous for new entrants. Individual courses offered by Multiversity’s academic
institutions are subject to accreditation requirements from the MIUR in order for them to provide the same legal
value as courses offered from a physical university, and courses must undergo a strict review process every
three years with institutions undergoing review every five years in order to maintain licensing. The regulatory
requirements, amongst others, reducing student to faculty ratio by a third pursuant to Decree 1154/2021, further
support the position of leading providers like Multiversity as opposed to smaller institutions who may lack the
resources to increase their teaching staff and whose profitability and operations would be impaired by adhering
to the regulation.

Lastly, 99% of tuition fees paid to Multiversity as of the 2022/2023 academic year are self-funded by students,
meaning that Multiversity is not dependent on public funding.

**_Multiversity is the leading online education platform in Europe and Italy, with a fit for purpose value_**
**_proposition, providing legally equivalent education with strong placement outcomes at an attractive pricing_**

Multiversity enjoys a clear leadership position in the Italian online university market by number of
undergraduate students due to its combination of operational expertise, extensive course offering, a fit for
purpose value proposition and continuous quality control that results in strong outcomes and student satisfaction
at an affordable price. Multiversity is the largest online university in Italy by number of undergraduate for the
2022/2023 academic year.[112] It is also the largest for-profit education group in the EU by number of
undergraduate and graduate students enrolled as of 2022.[113]

Online universities provide an accessible and flexible value proposition compared to physical universities.
Flexibility and time saving are the top reason that students choose an online university education, with 83% of
students citing this as a reason for their choice in 2023.[114]

through a superior technological platform, resulting in high student satisfaction and strong outcomes in terms of
graduation, retention, employment and examination. The key elements characterizing Multiversity’s value
proposition are: (i) a “student-centric” learning experience, (ii) accessibility, flexibility and convenience, (iii)

Multiversity’s academic offering is provided at an affordable price-point compared to other online and physical
universities in terms of tuition fees and overall cost of education. The average annual tuition at Multiversity for
the 2023/2024 academic year was lower than its online competitors at approximately €2,000 per student
(compared to €3,200-€3,400 per student for E-Campus Università, €2,700-€2,900 per student for Università
Niccolò Cusano and €2,000-€2,200 per student for Guglielmo Marconi as of 2023).[115] The overall cost of online
universities is also significantly lower than physical universities, in particular for students who study outside of
their hometown. The total cost of a degree[116] for students at online universities was €8,000-€10,000 as of 2023,
which is up to 7.5x lower than the total cost of studying at a physical university[117] for students attending
university outside of their hometown.[118] While online universities tend to have higher tuition fees on average
compared to physical universities, students save on rent costs (comprising about 50% of total education costs at
physical universities) and other costs such as commuting and exam costs (comprising about 40% of total
education costs at physical universities) and are able to graduate on average 0.8 years quicker, all as of 2023.[119]

**_Fully invested, scalable proprietary technology platform with in-house developed content designed to provide_**
**_high-quality user experience, complemented by a capillary physical network of orientation and exam centers_**

The technological platform developed by Multiversity over the years represents a clear competitive advantage.
Multiversity is a large online student community in Italy, with on average approximately 50,000 students on its
platform at any given time and 2 million daily page visits. User experience has always been at the center of the
development of Multiversity's advanced IT platform, which was fully digital from its inception. Students are
able to access all video lessons, class materials and mock exams, interact via video conference with professors
and tutors, and even attend exams online, all through user-friendly Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele
websites or mobile apps and personalized student dashboards.

Multiversity creates its content for these platforms with a focus on creating a high-quality user experience: while
professors create the content, they are supported throughout by Multiversity IT staff, which includes 40 content
delivery FTEs, who ensure that materials produced are optimized to be deployed across all its channels. The
company has developed its platform completely in-house, achieving a strong back-end able to deliver
seamlessly across all platforms and devices. Multiversity has seven recording rooms for content production,
with over 2,500 hours of content produced annually and 100% of classes recorded on video. Multiversity is able
to create new courses in a relatively short period of time, which is typically only one month for masters courses
and six months for undergraduate courses[120]. Students can enjoy an on-demand library of approximately 30,000
hours of content typically provided in 30-60 minute clips, covering 40 undergraduate courses and 318 other
courses including post-graduate and masters' courses.

Multiversity’s platform, in addition to leveraging the latest technology available such as facial recognition to
confirm student identity, offers advanced proprietary features such as a suggestion tool for its students (enabled
by artificial intelligence and machine learning) that prompts highly relevant content to each individual based on
their career path, grades and progress, and a new generative AI University Assistant Tool that leverages OpenAI
to provide students with 24/7 support through a chatbot exclusively trained with specific course content
(selected by professors), further assisting their studies by answering complex questions about their courses with
an accuracy rate surpassing 99% for the 2022/2023 academic year.

Multiversity’s technology platform is complemented by a physical network of ELCPs and exam locations that
allow extensive coverage of the entire country. Proximity and ease of access to local infrastructure are key
determinants for students when choosing between traditional forms of higher education and online and, within
the latter, selecting one university over another. ELCPs play a critical role in the Italian online university system

and serve as physical orientation points for prospective students and active students alike. Multiversity enjoys a
strong presence across Italy with a network of approximately 1,000 exclusive ELCPs (for the 2022/2023
academic year), which is estimated to be 2.5 times more than its closest competitor[121]. Additionally,
Multiversity has a country-wide network of approximately 100 exam locations (for the 2022/2023 academic
year), which is estimated to be 40% more than its closest competitor[122], and over 10 yearly exam sessions. The
numerous locations across Italy allow students to sit for exams close to their home cities, maintaining the
convenience of an online education while allowing students to meet their examination requirements.

Multiversity, by benefiting from the positive structural tailwinds described above and by delivering a strong
student centric offering, has a track record of impressive revenue, profitability and cash conversion growth. For
the year ended December 31, 2023, value of production was €419.9 million, Adjusted EBITDA was €247.2
million and operating free cash flow was €193.3 million, compared to €255.4 million, €150.1 million and
€139.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a compound annual growth
rate of 28.2%, 28.3% and 17.8%, respectively, mostly from organic growth. Excluding the revenue contributable
to the acquisition of San Raffaele on October 4, 2022, equal to €5.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2022 (limited to the two months consolidation) and to €30.2 for the year ended December 31, 2023,
Multiversity’s value of production increased by a compound annual growth rate of 23.1% over this two-year
period.

Further, Multiversity has a strong cash generation profile, supported by an asset-light structure and limited
capital expenditure. A combination of these features along with Multiversity’s track record of organic growth
has supported its deleveraging as illustrated below:

_Notes:_
_1._ _Net leverage as shown in the chart is defined as the ratio of (i) Total Financial Indebtedness as adjusted for repayment obligations_
_with respect to excess tuition fees received over (ii) Adjusted EBITDA._

_2._ _As adjusted for the 2021 Acquisition, the issuance of the Existing Notes and the 2022 Reverse Merger._

Multiversity’s organic growth has largely been driven by undergraduate enrollment. New undergraduate
enrollments have continued to grow over the years, increasing from around 50,000 in the 2017/2018 academic
year to around 151,000 in the 2022/2023 academic year. Undergraduate enrollment tends to have a longer
duration compared to graduate enrollment, with a strong conversion rate (40% of graduates from 3-year degree
programs apply for 1- or 2-year master’s degrees). These dynamics together with a low churn rate are of
particular relevance given that approximately 90% of the Group’s revenues for the year ended December 31,
2023 were generated from undergraduate programs[123], thus allowing strong visibility on future top-line
evolution.

Approximately 63% of Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 were already
secured as of January 1, 2023, primarily due to new enrollments for the 2022/2023 academic year between
August 2022 and December 2022 and to existing students’ enrollments for the 2022/2023 academic year,
while approximately 37% of revenues for the same period were derived from new students enrolled from
January 1, 2023.

**_High-quality and experienced management team, with strong execution track record and supported by an_**
**_internationally reputable advisory board and sponsor_**

Multiversity benefits from its highly experienced and committed management team, with deep education knowhow and relevant external professional experience. The management team is composed of both individuals
within the corporate headquarters and independent academic departments, which is designed to provide the
optimal mix between strategic vision, planning and control, and academic requirements. Multiversity's
management team is supported by the expertise of Multiversity’s recently established Advisory Board, which is
comprised of 10 internationally reputable professionals and prominent leaders in their respective fields, who
combine institutional experience and connectivity along with strategic vision, representing a key milestone in
Multiversity’s continuous journey towards quality higher education and research. Multiversity’s management
team is further supported by the strong and continuing commitment of CVC. CVC has a proven track record of
growing leading education groups across the world with a well-established presence in Italy since 1987. It has
made 13 investments in Italy over the last 10 years with a total equity investment of around €3.5 billion.

**_Significant growth and diversification opportunities from leveraging the existing non-university platform as_**
**_well as tangible upside from expanding into adjacent business lines or new international markets_**

The non-university market in Italy is large and highly fragmented, with addressable demand of approximately
€2.4-€2.5 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach approximately €3.5 billion by 2027[124], providing
Multiversity with opportunities to expand into this market by leveraging its existing scale, brand and expertise.

_Public Information, Company Information, Global Management Company_

In recent years, Multiversity has successfully broadened its product offering by entering the non-university
market through (i) the partnership with Sole 24 ORE Formazione, a provider of executive education programs
with strong brand recognition, an established corporate community in Italy and over 20 years of experience in
business education; and (ii) the acquisition of Aulab, an Italian provider of coding skills programs and a
reference player in the Italian digital training sector.

With its expertise in online university education and its comprehensive technology platform and method of
content delivery, Multiversity is well-positioned to expand into the non-university market and capture an even
greater market share in Italy and beyond.

**Business Strategy**

We pursue the following strategy to maintain and strengthen Multiversity’s position as the leading Italian online
higher education group.

**_Continue to consolidate Multiversity’s market position and address the large and structurally under-_**
**_penetrated Italian higher education market_**

The Italian higher education market remains structurally under-penetrated compared to other European and
other developed nations. Multiversity’s offering aims to tap into unmet demand in Italy across all student
categories. In particular, Multiversity will continue to target its historically core segment of latecomers, which is
comprised of individuals who are in the workforce but have not completed higher education, along with growing
its share of first year masters’ students and the younger and more resilient segment of incoming undergraduate
freshmen who are just coming out of secondary education.

Multiversity’s commitment to deliver an accessible and quality online education experience to its students is the
foundation of our strategy and mission. We will continue to offer Multiversity students flexibility and consistent
support during their academic careers, through a compelling student-centric learning experience that allows
students to have access to higher education regardless of where they are located and at an affordable price
compared to physical universities and other online universities. These factors facilitate higher graduation,
student satisfaction and retention rates compared to Multiversity’s competitors.


-----

The key drivers of this compelling proposition include the quality and breadth of Multiversity’s offering (which
is available to students on demand given that 100% percent of lectures are recorded and available for students to
access at their own time); an engaging user experience delivered through a proprietary and differentiated
cutting-edge technology platform, complete with a personalized student dashboard and virtual support; strong
brand recognition; a capillary network of physical ECLPs and exam centers; and attractive pricing.

Additionally, in line with the 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals, we remain committed to
delivering an inclusive and accessible education, promoting opportunities of continuous learning for everyone,
and facilitating access to job opportunities for Multiversity students.

**_Continue to invest in academic quality and research, improving the student learning experience along with_**
**_facilitating effective placement into the job market_**

The breadth of Multiversity’s offering is one of the factors behind its success. Multiversity’s commitment to the
continuing investment in and improving of academic quality and research represents a core priority of our
strategy. We intend to continue growing Multiversity’s base of professors and focus on attracting highly
respectable professors with strong academic backgrounds, high publication rates and high rankings within their
respective fields.

Additionally, the level and quality of Multiversity’s educational offering is continuously monitored through a
comprehensive quantitative framework through which we track over 25 KPIs, which are actively monitored to
ensure the effectiveness of Multiversity’s educational offering and student placement. The framework operates
in three-steps: (i) first, we analyze an inbound student’s profile using demographic and education background
data; (ii) second, we measure the effectiveness of the delivery of Multiversity’s in-classroom and out-ofclassroom educational offering by tracking faculty excellence (such as publications, citations and research) and
learning outcome metrics (such as graduation, re-enrollment, churn rate and satisfaction); and (iii) lastly, we
measure post-degree placement performance, including employment rates and yearly salaries. This holistic
framework is critical to the ongoing development of Multiversity’s educational offering and supporting the
delivery of educational outcomes and high satisfaction to Multiversity students.

A number of further opportunities to enhance the overall student learning experience are generated by
developments in AI. Multiversity has already launched certain AI tools and services, including a Tutor Chatbot,
and will remain committed to innovation and investment through AI in augmentation of curriculum
development, compliance with standards, automatization of support services and other areas.

Beyond investments in academia, we believe Multiversity has the ability to further leverage its cutting-edge
technological platform to deliver educational content in a streamlined, intuitive and efficient manner within and
beyond its core education segments. Multiversity’s technological platform, which is supported by an internal IT
team with full back- and front-end capabilities, is proprietary and scalable. All of Multiversity’s library content,
consisting of over 30,000 hours of video across 40 undergraduate courses and 300 other courses including postgraduate and master’s courses, is produced in-house with a 1-6 month time-to-market, from designing a course
to making it available to students.

**_Maximize operating and financial performance_**

We continuously monitor and evaluate Multiversity’s operational performance to identify opportunities for
enhancement and to capitalize on embedded growth.

Multiversity continues to place significant emphasis on managing its costs efficiently, benefiting from higher
operating leverage and maintaining operational flexibility. This efficient production capability, together with
Multiversity’s current and relevant content library and proprietary platform, support Multiversity’s scalable
business model and sustained organic growth. We believe that Multiversity’s strong growth, combined with its
limited capital expenditure requirements, high cash conversion capabilities, and strong profitability margins,
will continue to generate significant cash flows to enable operational deleveraging.

We also seek to continue to generate tuition fee growth above cost inflation. Multiversity’s value proposition is
accessible at an affordable price, as Multiversity’s average tuition fee of €2,000 for the 2023/2024 academic
year is below both the average of Multiversity’s competitors and the average price students are prepared to pay
for online undergraduate university education. When combined with growing demand for online education,


-----

Multiversity’s strong brand awareness and reputation provide us with the opportunity to continue to grow our
revenues organically while sustaining our margins.

**_Pursue opportunities to grow selectively beyond Multiversity’s core undergraduate education segments and_**
**_online delivery model, leveraging the Group’s existing capabilities and integration track-record_**

We will continue to assess and pursue opportunities to grow beyond the core university segment by leveraging
Multiversity’s brand and capabilities, as well as through Multiversity’s existing non-university education
platform (including the provision of B2B/B2C executive education through the Sole 24 ORE Formazione
partnership and Multiversity’s Aulab coding factory) and selectively pursuing growth opportunities to further
broaden the reach of Multiversity’s business model.

In particular, we have identified three strategic initiatives for potential international expansion:

  - **Bolt-on acquisitions: Multiversity considers select opportunities for expansion through bolt-on**
acquisitions on an opportunistic basis, such as acquiring physical or online universities. Over recent
years, Multiversity has demonstrated its M&A capabilities with a successful execution track-record and
established processes for the efficient integration of acquired companies within the Group.

  - **Organic growth and partnerships: Multiversity has identified opportunities to expand into select**
Mediterranean countries, to leverage the Pegaso International brand and to establish partnerships with
local universities to offer an EU-recognized education in countries with a high propensity of emigration
to Italy and other countries in the European Mediterranean region, contributing to faster organic
expansion.

  - **Digital partnerships: Given its proprietary technological platform, we believe that Multiversity has**
the opportunity to form digital partnerships with education providers in developing countries to offer
technical support and online platforms, marketing strategy and other services to deliver university
content locally.

Within Italy, Multiversity's growth strategy will be focused on (i) consolidation of its university business
through the opportunistic acquisition of digital universities and the pursuit of physical opportunities, while
seeking to move towards a hybrid model and (ii) the expansion of its non-university offering synergistically,
through which it aims to strengthen its value proposition, widen its course offering and increase its presence in
the B2C/B2B continuous learning space.

**_History_**

The Italian inter-Ministerial Decree (issued jointly by the MIUR and the Italian Ministry of Technological
Innovation) of April 17, 2003 paved the way for the establishment of private online universities in Italy. The
decree was aimed at increasing the percentage of Italians holding a bachelor’s degree (at the time, amongst the
lowest in Europe). Pegaso was founded in 2006 as a non-commercial entity, having been licensed by the
Ministerial Decree of the MUIR of April 20, 2006, and launched its first two degree programs, one being a three
year bachelor’s degree and the other a single-cycle five year degree.

By 2010, Pegaso had more than 200 post-graduate degree and post-graduate diploma courses, and by the 201213 academic year, had up to 30,000 enrolled students.

By 2015, Pegaso had over 65 examination centers in Italy. Pegaso further expanded its offering through the
acquisition of the majority stake in Mercatorum and founded Pegaso International Ltd. based in Malta. By 2019,
Multiversity’s institutions had over 100,000 enrolled students.

In 2019, CVC acquired 50% of the share capital of Multiversity from the founder, Mr. Danilo Iervolino, and
Pegaso transformed into a private corporation in the form of a limited liability company (see “Regulation—
_Transformation of Pegaso into a private corporation”). The Principe di Napoli campus was also launched in the_
same year. At the time of these activities, Multiversity had over 100,000 students enrolled. Since CVC’s
investment in 2019, there has been a significant increase in enrolled students, paired with a greater academic
offering and the appointment of highly experienced management.

In 2021, Paganini, a Luxembourg company indirectly controlled by CVC, entered into a sale and purchase
agreement pursuant to which Paganini BidCo was designated as buyer to acquire the 50% of the share capital of


-----

Multiversity S.r.l. from Mr. Danilo Iervolino. Prior to this acquisition, on November 4, 2019, Paganini had
acquired from MultiSpa 50% of the share capital of Multiversity S.r.l. through a wholly equity financed
investment.

On July 22, 2022, the Perimeter Assets merged into Multiversity S.r.l., with accounting and tax effects
backdated to January 1, 2022. On the same date, the incorporating company (Multiversity S.r.l.) changed its
legal form from a limited liability company to a joint stock company, thus becoming Multiversity S.p.A. (the
Target of the Acquisition contemplated herein).

On September 16, 2022, Multiversity acquired 60.61% of Aulab, a company active in the training of software
developers, which also designs and develops websites, IT platforms and software applications.

On October 4, 2022, Multiversity acquired 100% of the share capital of Società di Gestione e Partecipazione
dell’Università Telematica San Raffaele Roma S.r.l., a company that serves as the promoting entity of San
Raffaele, an academic institution that delivers courses mainly related to biomedical and healthcare sciences.

On October 3, 2022, Multiversity entered into an investment and shareholders’ agreement for the establishment
of a partnership with Il Sole 24 Ore S.p.A., one of Italy’s leading finance newspapers, to operate Sole 24 Ore
Formazione, which delivers B2B and B2C executive master's courses to professionals and young graduates. In
accordance with the provisions of the investment and shareholders’ agreement, Sole 24 Ore Formazione was
incorporated by Il Sole 24 Ore S.p.A. on October 3, 2022, and, on November 9, 2022, Multiversity acquired
from Il Sole 24 Ore S.p.A. a participation equal to 85% of the corporate share capital of Sole 24 Ore
Formazione. On December 15, 2023, Multiversity acquired 5.379% of the share capital of Materias S.r.l., an
incubator of scientific research activities engaged in identifying innovative ideas in the field of advanced
materials, predominantly generated from the academic sector.

In the 2022/2023 academic year, Multiversity had approximately 206,000 enrolled students, relying on its new
student e-learning platform in order to accommodate its enrolled students across its educational institutions
offering new interactive and effective functionalities based on its experience in education and artificial
intelligence technology spanning over ten years.

**_Online Universities_**

Pegaso is Multiversity’s largest university. Approximately 140,000 students were enrolled in Pegaso’s online

**_Academies, Partnerships and Other Assets_**

Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele have established a number of specialized academies and partnerships in
collaboration with their business partners, such as Principe di Napoli. Multiversity is also developing further
partnerships and academies as part of its strategy to form close relationships with employers with the aim of
developing skills in various vertical sectors through its unique teaching methods.


-----

Additionally, in December 2023, Multiversity acquired a minority stake in Materias S.r.l., an incubator of
scientific research activities engaged in identifying innovative ideas in the field of advanced materials, primarily
generated from the academic sector.

**Offering**

Multiversity’s core offerings, which make up its largest revenue share and student base, are its undergraduate
bachelor’s degree courses in the social sciences (17 courses), engineering and ICT (seven courses), education,
psychology, motor sciences and sports (11 courses) and literary, humanistic and linguistic (five courses) offered
across Multiversity’s institutions. However, one of the strengths of Multiversity’s offering is its large and
diversified portfolio of courses, designed to appeal to a broad demographic.

**_Pegaso International_**

Pegaso International offers four bachelor’s degrees and two Masters of Science in the areas of Business
Administration, Civil Engineering, Education Sciences, and Sport Science, Informatics and Sustainable
Development, and a Ph.D. program in Sustainable Development.

For the 2022/2023 academic year, 81 students were enrolled in Pegaso International (64 in undergraduate
courses and 17 in postgraduate and language courses).

_Ancillary Services_

Various other services are offered to the undergraduate and postgraduate students of Pegaso, Mercatorum and
San Raffaele for additional fees, which mainly relate to certificates and supplemental diplomas.

_Learning Method_

Multiversity’s e-learning institutions’ educational methods involve setting learning objectives (units of learning
content) that are to be achieved through a multitude of tools, materials and services. For each video class, these
are:

- the written core text of the lecture, with bibliographical references and notes;

- slides (supplemented with text, tables, images, graphs) with audio commentary by the lecturer;

- video recordings of the lessons, available to view in either real-time or subsequently at any other time
on the online platform; and

- self-assessment exercises to evaluate the student’s progress.

Final examinations take place at Multiversity’s examination centers throughout Italy (or, in the case of Pegaso
International, Malta) and are overseen by a commission appointed by the rector and chaired by a university
professor.

In order to complete a specific course, students are required to:

- carry out a number of interim assessments (on-line tests to verify learning stages, development of
papers, any laboratory activities, etc.);

- view at least 80% of the online lessons available on the platform; and

- pass the final examination, to be taken in person at the university facilities.


-----

Within each course, students are subject, for each discipline, to interim assessments which are compulsory but
not a prerequisite to qualify for the final examination, in order to constantly monitor learning levels. The
assessments may consist of tests (closed-answer, open-answer, multiple-choice, etc.), exercises, simulations or
group projects.

_Credit and qualification frameworks_

Pegaso’s, Mercatorum’s and San Raffaele’s undergraduate courses confer the qualifications provided for under
the Italian Qualifications Framework, as established by the MIUR in accordance with the Qualifications
Framework for the European Higher Education Area.

The European Credit Transfer System (“ECTS”), an EU-wide education metric aimed at making studies and
courses more transparent, applies to the courses offered at Multiversity’s core institutions. This allows students
to move between countries to obtain their academic qualifications and study periods abroad which are
recognized by allowing credits taken at one higher educational institution to be counted towards a qualification
acquired at another educational institution. One CFU is equivalent to one ECTS credit and students must cover
approximately one third of studies online in order to meet the requirements to pass the examinations

Pegaso International’s courses provide qualifications recognized under the ECTS system, applied within the
European Qualification Framework (“EQF”). The EQF is an eight-level learning outcomes-based framework
for all types of qualifications that serves as a harmonization tool between different national qualifications
frameworks. This framework helps improve transparency, comparability and portability of qualifications and
makes it possible to compare qualifications from different countries and institutions. The EQF covers all types
and all levels of qualifications and the use of learning outcomes to acknowledge the actual skills and
qualifications of individuals. The level increases according to the level of proficiency, level 1 being the lowest
and level 8 the highest. Courses offered by Pegaso International are EQF level 6 or level 7. The EQF is closely
linked to national qualifications frameworks, thereby providing a comprehensive map of all types and levels of
qualifications in Europe, which are increasingly accessible through qualification databases.

_Quality assurance_

In order to ensure the professionalism and quality of degree courses, the MIUR conducts quality assessments
through ANVUR, which is vested with the authority to, among other things, evaluate procedures, results and
outputs of institutions’ management, teaching, research and technological transfer activities, and conduct the
rankings of merit and prestige of both traditional and online universities. The assignment of such rankings is a
legal requirement for the operation of (i) universities offering at least 30% of courses as distance learning
courses or (ii) online universities, which are both scored on a scale from A-tel (very positive) to E-tel
(unsatisfactory), with the consequential closure of the online delivery platform in the event of a negative
outcome.

In its most recent research quality evaluation, the commission of experts appointed by ANVUR assigned a Level
C-tel score to Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele, corresponding to a satisfactory grade in accordance with
applicable Italian regulations. The next quality evaluation will be conducted in 2024 for San Raffaele and in
2025 for Pegaso and Mercatorum.

The periodic accreditation assessments are processed following on-site visits to the universities by the
commission appointed by ANVUR. The periodic accreditation visits are carried out in three phases: (i) a remote
examination of the documentation made available by the university to the commission, (ii) the actual on-site
visit in order to examine the degree programs and the departments selected by ANVUR for each university and
(iii) the drafting of a report by the commission. See “Regulation” below.

MEDEA, as a provider authorized to deliver courses of study under Pegaso International with MFHEA
(formerly NCFHE) License n.2006-001, is required to ensure compliance with the ten standards of quality
assurance established by the MFHEA in the performance of its internal administrative and teaching procedures.
On November 28, 2023, following the successful outcome of the quality assurance requirements audit
performed by the MFHEA on November 6 and 7, 2023, MEDEA was awarded with the Higher Education
Institute indefinite status licence.

For further information on the quality assurance framework to which the universities of Multiversity are subject.
See “Regulation” below.


-----

_Performance monitoring systems for academic staff_

Although there is no requirement under the applicable Italian legislative framework to monitor the performance
of academic staff in private universities, Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele have established the respective
procedures, as indicated in the “Quality Assurance” section of their respective websites. There are also models
for evaluation of professors by students (required by ANVUR) which are carried out periodically. The
performance of university professors is also evaluated on the number of academic papers published by them (i.e.
on the basis of their personal research track record).

Professors are contractually required to ensure their course materials remain up to date and the majority of the
materials are updated on a rolling basis, while a full content update is required every three years.

See “—Employment—Faculty training and development” below.

**Research**

**_General_**

In line with the general principles set out in its articles of association, the universities of Multiversity (Pegaso,
San Raffaele and Mercatorum) promote the international development of teaching, research and studies, in
particular through cultural exchange between countries and by instituting collaborations with the most
prestigious universities in the EU.

Grants and research projects contributed to approximately 1% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2023.

**_Benecon_**

In accordance with its corporate mission, Benecon carries out scientific research into airborne sensors,
specifically aircraft that are designed to perform aerial remote sensing actions thanks to hyperspectral, thermal,
photographic sensors developed by Benecon for the monitoring of environmental matrices (air-land-water). Two
researchers from Benecon’s 15-member team are from Pegaso.

Benecon is sponsored by UNESCO and therefore participates in its international research projects in
conjunction with other UNESCO partners.

**Enrollment, Student Demographics and Performance by Entity**

**_Enrollment growth, gross/net_**

The following table shows the number of undergraduate students (in thousands) enrolled at each of Pegaso,

Because of the average tuition fee applied by Multiversity’s institutions (pursuant to the captive agreements that
provide for the application of reduced corporate rates for certain categories of students—see “—Preferential and
_corporate rates” below) and the duration of the various categories of courses identified in the table above, the_
absolute number of enrollments is not indicative of the weight of tuition fee revenue, being just one of the key
indicators of Multiversity’s revenue streams. The evolution of the student base demonstrates a fast-growing
trend in the undergraduate degree offering, which represents the largest contribution to revenue given the higher
tuition fee, ancillary services revenue on top of the tuition fee and duration of the students’ academic career
(undergraduate degrees have a duration spanning from three to five years, whilst postgraduate courses), whilst
showing a decline in enrollments in postgraduate and individual courses.

**_Demographics of Multiversity’s Student Population_**

Undergraduate students form the majority of Multiversity’s institutions’ student base. In particular, Multiversity
has a diversified student base, mostly consisting of young working students. The majority of students is aged
18-34 years old (71%), is based in Southern Italy and Islands (57%), and works in public administration or in
small and medium enterprises. The table below sets out Multiversity’s demographic data for the academic years
2022/2023, 2021/2022 and 2020/2021 for Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele on a combined basis relevant
for both the new students enrolled in undergraduate courses and the postgraduate courses. Undergraduates make
up the majority of Multiversity’s student population and Multiversity tends to observe a high incidence of (i)
younger students (students aged 18-34) and first-generation students (i.e., students accessing higher education
for the first time) which have been and are expected to increase in the near future; and (ii) students from
Southern Italy and Islands (as a reflection of Mulriversity’s original footprint).

Multiversity’s new students enrolled in undergraduate courses are mainly composed of younger students (aged
18-34), representing approximately 71%, 72% and 72% of the total number of newly enrolled undergraduate
students in the 2022/2023, 2021/2022 and 2020/2021 academic years, and Multiversity recorded 53%, 52%, and
54% younger students (aged 18-34) enrolled in postgraduate courses in the 2022/2023, 2021/2022 and
2020/2021 academic years, respectively. The chart below provides the breakup of Multiversity’s undergraduate
students by age for the 2022/2023 academic year[ 131]:

Multiversity also relies on its student base from Southern Italy and Islands[132], both in undergraduate courses
(57% in the 2022/2023 academic year, 57% in the 2021/2022 academic year and 57% in the 2020/2021
academic year) and postgraduate courses (57% in the 2022/2023 academic year, 56% in the 2021/2022
academic year and 50% in the 2020/2021 academic year). However, Multiversity also observes a stable student
base from Northern Italy[133] with respect to enrollments in both undergraduate courses (27% in the 2022/2023

129 Includes postgraduate master’s courses, higher education courses, specialization courses and (in respect of Pegaso) certifications.

130 Includes single exams.

academic year and 27% in the 2020/2021 academic year). The chart below provides the breakup of
Multiversity’s undergraduate students by geography for the 2022/2023 academic year[134]:

In addition, Multiversity closely monitors the year of enrollment and the origin of its students enrolled in
undergraduate courses as illustrated in the table below for the 2022/2023, 2021/2022 and 2020/2021 academic
years for Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele on a combined basis. The chart below provides the breakup of
Multiversity’s undergraduate students by student type for the 2022/2023 academic year[135]:

Multiversity observed one of the strongest increases in newly enrolled undergraduate students in the 2022/2023
academic year, experiencing an increase of 34% as compared to the prior academic year. Latecomers[136]
accounted for 64%, 66% and 64% of the total number of newly enrolled undergraduate students in the
2022/2023, 2021/2022 and 2020/2021 academic years, respectively. Additionally, a fair number of
undergraduate students (25% in the 2022/2023 academic year as compared to 24% in 2021/2022 academic year
and 25% in the 2020/2021 academic year) who acquired bachelor’s degrees in Pegaso, Mercatorum, San
Raffaele or other universities continued their education by enrolling in 2-year master degree courses.

The overall churn rate (calculated as the percentage of enrolled students dropping out prior to graduation to the
total number of enrolled students) with respect to Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele for the 2022/2023
academic year was equal to approximately 6%, as compared to approximately 5% for the 2021/2022 academic
year, and approximately 5% (not including San Raffaele) for the 2020/2021 academic year.

134 Public Information, Global Management Company

135 Public Information, Global Management Company

136 Refers to (i) new undergraduate students who have never been enrolled at a university before and are at least 21 years old, (ii)

students who enroll again after having dropped-out their studies, and (iii) students who were previously enrolled at other

physical universities.


-----

The breadth of Multiversity's educational offering is one of the key drivers of its compelling proposition. The
chart below provides the breakup of Multiversity’s undergraduate students by area of study for the 2022/2023
academic year, showing 41% in social sciences, 38% in education, psychology, motor sciences and sports, 12%
in engineering, architecture and ICT, and 9% in other areas[137]:

In addition, due to the flexiblity Multiversity's online education platform offers, many undergraduate students
are working students throughout their academic journey with Multiversity. Working students under the age of
35 are mostly employed in the private sector.[138]

The chart below provides the breakup of Multiversity’s undergraduate students by employment profile for the
2022/2023 academic year, showing 21% of full-time students and 79% of working students, of which 35% in

**December 31,**


**Revenues from sales and services (€)** **2023** **2022**


_(in thousands of euro)_


Other income related to teaching ..................................................................................................... 3,784 2,887

**Total .................................................................................................................................................** **414,491** **328,689**

The value of sales and services amounting to €414.5 million as of December 31, 2023, mainly includes revenues
deriving from the educational offer of Multiversity’s universities, training courses and EIPASS cards offered by
Certipass, and all other operating income related to teaching. The increase over the period is mostly due to the
growing number of new enrollments in the universities. Almost all of Multiversity’s revenues are derived in
Italy, given that the operations are almost entirely based and performed in Italy.

**_Preferential and corporate rates_**

Pegaso, Multiversity and San Raffaele have in place over 1,000 commercial agreements as of December 31,
2023, securing captive customers which provide for the application of corporate rates for undergraduate and
postgraduate degree courses. The majority of these provide for the application of a reduced tuition fee with
respect to the full tuition fee.

The vast majority of students enrolled at Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele are entitled to the application of
reduced corporate rates under such agreements, a strong indication that the volume and geographic distribution
of Multiversity’s commercial partnerships across the Italian territory, coupled with the appeal of an innovative
and flexible training method, is key to Multiversity’s business strategy. These rates may apply to specific
degrees, master’s or higher education courses, and in some cases may also apply to certain categories of students
– for example, new graduates or pregnant women, in order to render the course offering more attractive to such
groups. For courses that last more than one year, the preferential tuition fee will apply for each year of the
course.

**_Student funding_**

Tuition fees paid to Multiversity are in the majority of cases funded by the students themselves, with the very
rare use of scholarships. There are no instances of payment by employers on behalf of their employees, nor of
students benefiting from government loans.

In respect of undergraduate courses and academic master’s degrees, payment of tuition fees is due in four equal
installments payable in November, May, June and July of each academic year. The tuition fees for postgraduate
master’s courses and single courses are paid as a lump sum payment.

**Employment**

**_Number of employees (including faculty members) by entity_**

As of December 31, 2023, Multiversity employed a total of 919 people on a permanent or temporary basis
across its institutions, including extraordinary professors (i.e. professors with fixed term contract falling within
the scope of article 1, comma 12 of Law no. 230 of 2005), tutors and administrative staff, of which 414
(including 116 professors and researchers) are retained by Pegaso, 203 (including 82 professors and researchers)
by Mercatorum, 148 (including 94 professors and researchers) by San Raffaele and 154 by other companies of
the Group. The number of professors has increased significantly over the past few years, from 39 as of
December 31, 2019 to 296 (with four professors on maternity leave during the year) as of December 31, 2023.

In terms of cost of personnel for Multiversity, the table below illustrates the entire expense for employees
(excluding contract professors and other academic staff engaged by Multiversity as external consultants)
including social security contributions, the cost of unused holidays and accruals, legal provisions and collective
agreements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The individual cost items are set out as follows:

**December 31,**

**(€ thousands)** **2023** **2022**

Wages and salaries ............................................................................................................................. 31,844 19,690

Social security charges ....................................................................................................................... 8,586 6,004

Allocations to employee termination indemnity ................................................................................ 1,574 1,175

Other personnel costs ......................................................................................................................... 583 865


-----

**December 31,**


**(€ thousands)** **2023** **2022**

**Total ....................................................................................................................................................** **42,587** **27,734**

The increase shown above is mainly due to the need for additional personnel to support the Group’s growth.

Academic staff is recruited through either a public bid process with respect to the associate and tenured
professors, researchers and rectors or through a CV selection process with respect to extraordinary professors,
tutors and contract professors. Academic staff tend to come from traditional universities, often the institutions at
which they qualified and had subsequently gained teaching experience.

**_Remuneration of Professors and Researchers_**

The Italian national legislative framework on the remuneration of professors, which sets out in specific tables
the range of wages payable to tenured professors and associate professors at all universities across the country
(such wages varying on the grade of professor and based on whether the professors are permanent professors[140]
or full term professors[141], provided that both tenured professors and associate professors are employed under
permanent contracts) and researchers, which are instead employed on fixed term contracts. Such statutory
provisions apply to all universities, with no distinction between public or private, “traditional” or online
universities. The level of remuneration applicable to the relevant professor within the ranges specific above will
depend on the grade of such professor. Following an assessment of the relevant professor’s scientific production
(e.g., research activities, publications, etc.) and a formal evaluation based on criteria regulated by law, tenured
and associate professors may progress to a higher grade every three years, thereby becoming entitled to the next
level of remuneration.

Researchers have temporary contracts that may be a: (a) six-year contract, with the possibility of a single twoyear extension, based on an assessment of the educational and research activities carried out; or (b) six-year
contract without possibility of extension.[142]Remuneration due to researchers under (b) above may be increased
up to a maximum of 30%.

**_Stock option plan and incentives_**

At its meeting held on May 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of Multiversity approved a stock option plan
comprising 1000 options with regard to the shares of Multiversity S.r.l. (the “Plan”) for the benefit of directors,
employees and/or collaborators of the Group and its subsidiaries to be identified by the Board of Directors from
time to time.

The Multiversity shareholders’ meeting of June 23, 2021 approved a non-proportional share capital increase by
a nominal amount equal to €1,000 in favor of some key managers of the Group, who have been assigned the
option rights to subscribe the capital increase once some relevant conditions are met. The stock options
conferred pursuant to the Plan can be exercised upon the occurrence of certain events and subject to certain
conditions. Since the key conditions are not met at the time of preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the share capital was not subscribed. Such new shares are reserved for subscription within the final
deadline of December 31, 2035.

The key managers of the Group, as approved by the Board of Directors meeting held in February 2021, are
attributed a bonus if some key parameters, in terms of Group and individual economic performance are met,
based on the year end results. An estimate of year-end bonuses is accrued in the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

140 Pursuant to Article 6 of Law 240/2010, for the purposes of reporting of the research activities, the annual activities of research,
study and teaching, with the related preparatory tasks, verification and organization, is equal to 1,500 hours per year for
permanent professors and researchers. Furthermore, permanent professors carry out research and scientific updating activities
and, on the basis of criteria and procedures established by university regulations, are required to allocate annually for teaching
and student service tasks, including orientation and tutoring, as well as activities of verification of learning, not less than 350
hours.

141 Pursuant to Article 6 of Law 240/2010, for the purposes of reporting of the research activities, the annual activities of research,
study and teaching, with the related preparatory tasks, verification and organization, is equal to 750 hours per year for full term
professors and researchers. Furthermore, full term professors carry out research and scientific updating activities and, on the
basis of criteria and procedures established by university regulations, are required to allocate annually for teaching and student
service tasks, including orientation and tutoring, as well as activities of verification of learning, not less than 250 hours.

142 Researchers falling in this category may only be qualified as permanent.


-----

Multiversity’s extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of October 31, 2023 resolved to amend certain terms and
conditions of the share capital increase serving the Plan in order to provide, in particular, that the share capital
increase may be executed in one or more tranches with gradual effectiveness of subscriptions through the
issuance of class B shares with no par value reserved for subscription to the beneficiaries of the Plan, as
amended and approved by Multiversity’s board of directors on October 31, 2023.

Furthermore, Multiversity has long term incentives in place, regulated by individual agreements with
employees, with the purpose of incentivizing employees’ retention and their contribution to the Group’s growth.

_Faculty retention and churn rates_

The associate or tenured professors of Pegaso, Mercatorum or San Raffaele that were originally in the
organization have rarely left the Multiversity educational institutions voluntarily. In certain instances, faculty
staff employed on temporary contracts have been offered positions elsewhere. Professors that are not tenured are
engaged through fixed term contracts, which are renewed on an annual basis. Many junior professors are
employed as researchers on fixed term contracts and are subsequently employed indefinitely after winning
tenure as associates.

Researchers are offered a six-year contract that may be extended by the institution for a further two years if their
research meets certain criteria.

As part of Multiversity’s talent retention strategy, temporary personnel that qualify for associate professorship
typically commence the process of becoming tenured professors within approximately four months.

_Faculty training and development_

Pegaso has opened a Teaching and Learning Center dedicated to the training of faculty members with a
particular focus on remote learning techniques. Mandatory training courses are also made available to professors
on the e- learning platform (e.g. techniques/guides for organizing materials, courses on interactive teaching) and
training for tutors (led by more experienced tutors and professors).

The same applies to Mercatorum where given the university’s assistance to the Italian chambers of commerce,
focus groups also are established to monitor and study legislative developments that are relevant to the
chambers of commerce.

With a view to attracting talent, the Boards of Directors of the three universities consider all faculty who have
passed into the first rank for the role of full professor, which is an uncommon practice in the industry.

**Technology Platform**

The e-learning platform utilized by Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele, which is proprietary and owned by
Multiversity[143], was among the first e-learning platforms in Italy to be run through mobile applications,
combining innovative technology with modern e-learning methods. Key characteristics of the platform are the
following:

- the platform may be run from any device, including iOS and Android;

- student-friendly and accessible 24 hours a day;

- allows immediate access to the entire online university educational offering;

- creates and encourages student community in an online hub, aimed at team building and the stimulation
of ideas for the creation of new businesses; and

143 By means of a deed dated October 25, 2019, Multiversity S.p.A. transferred the business unit that carries out university training
support services, including proprietary rights in the IT platform to Multiversity S.r.l. As a result of the aforementioned
contribution, all existing relationships and all new activities relating to the aforementioned business unit are managed by
Multiversity S.r.l.


-----

- contains interactive modules with innovative live-chat technology including multichannel chat systems,
videochat and virtual classrooms, as well as online self-assessment (exercises and mock tests).

Students can watch lessons, access class materials and thematic blogs, interact with professors and tutors,
participate with other students in the social community.

Course content is prepared by academic staff, with the support of Multiversity IT staff who, among other things,
professionally edit files and enable their delivery across all e-learning platforms. All original course content is
owned by the relevant institutions of Multiversity.

Certipass uses only a small part of the Multiversity e-learning platform, as it has developed its own proprietary
platform which is used solely for the assessments required to grant the EIPASS certifications. Certipass uses the
same cybersecurity and data protection systems as Multiversity.

**_Core systems_**

Multiversity has continuously invested in its IT platform and systems from its inception in order to deliver the
highest quality online learning platform.

The platform is entirely owned by Multiversity. The e-learning platforms and core systems are developed fully
in-house, originally leveraging an open-source software that was customized to develop a unique proprietary
platform. Since 2017, the platform has been run and stored on servers hosted by AWS cloud data centers to
maximize efficiency, with horizontal and physical back-up for disaster recovery. A backup copy of the stored
data is kept at the data center at Pegaso’s headquarters in Naples, which is activated in the event of disaster
recovery to ensure zero time loss of service. The current package contracted with AWS is for 150
terabyte/month of data storage and relies on a multi-server system, with a load balancer to manage user traffic
overload.

Multiversity leverages on a proprietary and in-house developed technology platform and ensures high scalability
and an excellent student experience, thanks to a personalized student dashboard which allows maximization of
the learning potential and tracks progress of the didactic path. Through the use of cookies and app tracking,
personalized content is provided to users with respect to their university career, including suggestions for
postgraduate pathways and invitations to continue studying if certain academic targets are reached.

Multiversity’s IT team, which includes software developers, content production and IT Infrastructure personnel,
is currently composed of 49 employees.

A new web version of the platform was launched over the summer of 2021, incorporating several updates
including a new design, more interactive interface and other user experience improvements.

_Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning_

Multiversity has developed a multi-year plan which addresses the opportunities that AI and ML offers to
improve students’ learning experience and increase operational efficiency, and is ideally positioned to leverage
AI tools and successfully compete with other higher education institutions in Italy and Europe. Through this
multi-year plan Multiversity already developed two products: (i) an AI University Assistant Tool that leverages
OpenAI to provide students with 24/7 support through a chatbot exclusively trained with specific course content
selected by professors, and (ii) a technology/administrative chatbot for customer care that leverages Amazon
Bedrock.

In particular, the AI University Assistant tool is seen as one of the most advanced ones in its field globally,
providing answers with an over 99% accuracy. This performance is continuously tracked through a dedicated
multi-level monitoring team. Multiversity reviews the global market for AI-based solutions in education on a
weekly basis through a strategic observatory, which continuously monitors any potential developments along
with any risks and opportunities in the education space. These potential opportunities primarily include new
learning formats (such as virtual laboratories and tutoring chatbots), new topics to be taught to address the
growing demand for AI roles in the job market, and the automatization of support services.

The following graphic describes Multiversity’s multi-year plan for the adoption of generative AI solutions and
other related innovations:

_Evaluation and compliance of IT platform_

Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele must meet legal requirements, which are reviewed by the ANVUR
Evaluation Committee every five years. Pegaso and Mercatorum scored high rankings/ratings with respect to the
technology used during the last evaluation in October 2017.

Under the previous legislative framework, periodic evaluations needed to be carried out every five years through
a five-day site visit by the ANVUR Evaluation Committee. Pegaso obtained the highest rating among online
universities during the last periodic evaluation and on that basis the site visit (which would be necessary in case
of an insufficient rating) is no longer required. As a result, it is sufficient to provide a report to the ANVUR
Evaluation Committee. The most recent report was provided to the ANVUR Evaluation Committee on June 30,
2021.

_Cybersecurity and data protection_

Multiversity has established and maintains cybersecurity systems that are developed and updated internally,
including a monitoring system that monitors the platform and code transactions on it. The cloud data centers are
only accessible through Pegaso’s headquarters in Naples, by authorized members of the IT team through a twotier security system. In particular, Multiversity employs a cybersecurity program leased from Amazon in order
to protect against the risk of DDoS[144] cyber-attacks.

Users’ passwords are tokenized; access to servers is allowed only through the network and firewalls present at
the business center at Muliversity’s headquarters. Access to all externally-facing applications is protected by a
web application firewall and users are required to register and create a personal profile accessible through a
username and password, which is encrypted and tokenized, ensuring that the specific user may only view areas
within the application to which it has been granted access. In addition, a secure hash algorithm protects users’

144 ‘Denial of Service’ cyber attacks in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its
intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.


-----

stored credentials on the server side. The security measures adopted under the platform ensure protection of
user’s personal data in compliance with the GDPR and Multiversity provides information to its employees on an
annual basis as to the data protection measures that need to be put in place. Multiversity has procedures in place
for data collection and processing in accordance with the GDPR and Italian applicable law (including in order to
ensure that any revocation of permission by users to process their personal data is actioned within 24 hours).

In terms of client/server side security, the devices used by the students and academic staff are separate and there
is no direct client-side access to the servers.

In terms of protection against data loss, a back-up copy of stored data is accessible from the data center at
Pegaso’s headquarters in Naples and is activated in the event of disaster recovery to ensure zero time loss of
service. In the event of a system memory overload, temporary servers are created ensuring sufficient system
memory/CPU to run the platform. Through the use of this system, the platform does not have a limit to the
maximum number of users that may access it simultaneously.

Multiversity carries out penetration tests internally every time a new IT procedure is created, and risk
assessments are also carried out on an annual basis and in conjunction with any penetration test. Additionally, a
detailed risk assessment on AI adoption, which includes legal, privacy technical and sustainability
considerations and involves a data scientist expert in ML, is conducted by Multiversity every time a new AI
initiative is launched.

_Key differentiating platform features_

The following characteristics are the key differentiating features of Multiversity’s IT platform:

- the platform is entirely responsive;

- all the functions that are accessible through the web browser are also available on the application for
mobile devices; and

**Student Orientation and Marketing and Sales**

Around 61% of new students as of December 31, 2023 across Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele partake in
orientation activities at the ELCPs that make up Multiversity’s national network. Approximately 39% of
students as of December 31, 2023 are reached through traditional marketing methods, e.g. billboards and TV
advertising campaigns on both private and public Italian channels, as well as through its extensive online
presence on social media and online advertising, thereby gaining access to the widest possible audience. For the
year ended December 31, 2023, advertising costs represented, together with the contributions payable to the
ELCPs for their educational activities, approximately 45%[145] of Multiversity’s total consolidated costs. Students
are on-boarded and enrolled directly by Pegaso or Mercatorum, as applicable, which retain full control of the
enrollment process and maintain direct contact with the student.

Along with as its numerous websites, Pegaso has a significant online following on all major social media
outlets. Pegaso also runs an online streaming channel, UniPegaso TV, on which users can stream video content
such as descriptions of the courses offered and interviews with current students as well academic staff. In
addition, the online blog “MyPegaso” is open to contributions from teachers, researchers and students.

**ELCPs**

_ELCP Points, EI-Points and E Points_

In the case of Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele, the ELCP Points (for Pegaso), EI Points (for Mercatorum)
and E Points (for San Raffaele) are the ELCPs where students can request information regarding the services
offered by the relevant education institution. Such ELCPs provide orientation and support services to students
across Italy in order to prepare and enable them to effectively use the online resources available to them. Such
ELCPs also provide technical assistance such as recovery of access credentials to the platform.

145 Net of depreciation and devaluation


-----

Multiversity’s objective is to enlarge the network with new types of centers including, for example, universities.
The ELCPs are located on the premises owned and controlled by third-party service providers that have entered
into accreditation agreements with the relevant institution. See “—Material Contracts—Accreditation
_agreements for ELCPs.” Such third parties include language centers, basic IT course providers, education_
facilities, municipalities and centers to help prepare for traditional university admission tests. Prior to the
execution of each accreditation agreement, each center is assessed by the relevant institution as being a qualified
center for carrying out teaching, education and training projects, in line with that institution’s objectives.

Multiversity’s headquarters in Naples, where the Group’s management, teaching, technical-IT, administrative
and financial offices are located, is rented from the company Bellerofonte Immobiliare S.r.l. The headquarters of
Pegaso located in Naples in Piazza Trieste e Trento are leased from Mr. Danilo Iervolino.

146 Pegaso, Mercatorum, San Raffaele and Certipass in some cases each have accreditation agreements with the same ELCP,
which therefore performs services for more than one such institution.

**Intellectual Property**

The Multiversity Group is the registrant of 25 trademarks relating primarily to its logos and tradenames
throughout the Italian territory and in the EU and the UK. Multiversity has registered 101 domain names.

As of December 31, 2023, the value of industrial patents and intellectual property rights amounted to €70.5
million, which amount principally included assets forming part of the intangible assets of Multiversity
amounting to €69.3 million as well as other industrial patents and intellectual property rights owned by the rest
of the Group amounting to €1.2 million.

For the same period, the value of concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights held by Multiversity and
its universities was equal to €74.6 million.

Course materials produced by academic staff for use in courses are developed by the faculty with support from
Multiversity’s IT staff, with no outsourcing to third parties. Multiversity has a central database that collects all
the multimedia content of the lessons, which can be used by other Multiversity educational institutions or by
external partners in accordance with the commercial partnership agreements in place. All the post-production is
done in Naples at Multiversity’s business center. Pegaso’s, Mercatorum’s and San Raffaele’s employment
contracts provide that all intellectual property rights over such materials are the property of the relevant
institution, including following the termination of the employment relationship.

Additionally, Multiversity has registered the IT platform’s trademark, “Iuniversity” with the Italian Society of
Authors and Publishers (“SIAE”), the algorithm underlying the platform’s flowchart having also been registered
in the public register of software held by SIAE. Pegaso, Mercatorum, San Raffaele and Pegaso International use
Multiversity’s proprietary IT platform in order to deliver their courses.

**Material Contracts**

**_Accreditation agreements for ELCPs_**

As of December 31, 2023, there are approximately 1,000 accreditation agreements (each, an “Accreditation
**Agreement”) in place between the institutions of Multiversity and the entities accredited as ELCPs across the**
Italian territory. All ELCPs are managed by external third parties that have entered into specific accreditation
agreements with Pegaso, Mercatorum, San Raffaele or Certipass (in some cases, more than one institution has
entered into an accreditation agreement with the same ELCP).

_ELCP Points, EI-Points and E Points_

Generally, each Accreditation Agreement in respect of Pegaso’s ELCP Points, Mercatorum’s EI-Points and San
Raffaele’s E Points has a duration of 36 months from the date of its execution. Each entity accredited as an
ELCP Point, EI-Point or E Point is required to meet and maintain certain standards including in relation to
physical storage, technological equipment, minimum number of employees, etc.

Each ELCP Point, EI-Point and E Point is remunerated by way of a contribution (i) on average, of
approximately 20% of the tuition fees paid by each student enrolled in undergraduate degree courses, excluding
any ancillary fees, and which benefits from the orientation services provided by the relevant ELCP Point, EIPoint and E Point, and (ii) on average, of approximately 25% of the tuition fees paid by each student enrolled in
postgraduate or post-diploma master’s or training courses and which benefits from the orientation services
provided by the relevant ELCP Point, EI-Point or E Point. There is no obligation for ELCP Points, EI-Points or
E Points to enroll or to recruit students.

_EIPASS Points_

With regard to Certipass’ EIPASS Points, the terms of the relevant accreditation agreement have an initial
duration of two years. Pursuant to the relevant agreement, the EIPASS Point acquires a package of EI cards at
wholesale price and agrees to resell them to customers at the retail price detailed in the contract All agreements
confer the right on the relevant center to promote and disseminate the programs, EIPASS certifications and
services provided by Certipass itself, and the authorization to represent a Certipass exam physical venue.
Certipass agrees to provide to each EIPASS Point the necessary know-how and technical resources in order for
it to offer Certipass services, and also provides it with technical support and assistance as well as access to its


-----

platform. The relevant EIPASS Center can apply for EI cards, online courses, credits, and/or the qualification of
a new supervisor and/or trainer through the DIDASKO platform and undertakes to resell them at the minimum
prices indicated in the reference price list attached to the agreement.

_Commercial agreements securing captive customers_

Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele together have over 1,000 agreements in place with associations of public
bodies, trade unions, municipalities, cultural associations, private companies and sports associations for, _inter_
_alia, employee training and which provide for the application of preferential rates for their employees. Partners’_
employees are incentivized to attend these courses in order to accelerate their career paths or to comply with
requirements of regulators or employers. As such, this market is captive in nature and exposes Pegaso and
Mercatorum to a large potential customer base for its entire service offering.

The vast majority of such agreements are Business-to-Customer and apply directly to students. Preferential rates
are applicable upon verification at the time of enrollment that the student is entitled to benefit from the
preferential rates pursuant to the relevant agreement. The terms of such agreements are negotiated on a case by
case basis with each partner and therefore vary (see “—Preferential and corporate rates” above), however most
provide for a reduction of the full annual degree course tuition fee of €3,400 (excluding all-inclusive programs)
to a €1,200 - €2,500 range.

_Cooperation agreements with international institutions_

In order to promote internationalization in the fields of research, teaching and learning, every year Pegaso enters
into cooperation agreements with universities, including in connection with the Erasmus + Program, from all
over the world and actively participates in prestigious international networks.

Such agreements with international universities are made for a variety of purposes, including joint scientific
projects, exchange of materials and publications, creation of new courses of study, organization of conferences,
seminars and cultural initiatives.

**Sustainability**

**_Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”)_**

Achieving inclusive and quality education for all people reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most
powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development. The SDGs initiative established by the UN aims to
provide equal access to affordable vocational training, eliminate gender and wealth disparities and achieve
universal access to a quality higher education by 2030.

In line with the SDGs, Multiversity remains loyal to its commitment to ensure an inclusive and fair quality
education, to promote opportunities of continuous learning for everyone and a sustainable and inclusive
economic growth, facilitating access to honourable job opportunities for everyone. In this context, the online
education has no geographical barriers, flexible and democratic approach and can play a relevant role to attain
some of the main goals of the 2030 SDG agenda.

In addition to its compliance with relevant laws and regulations in relation to ESG and sustainability,
Multiversity approved an ESG strategic plan in June 2023 based on five pillars: (i) innovative, accessible and
quality education, (ii) a healthy work environment that promotes inclusion and diversity, (iii) protection of our
planet, (iv) community engagement, and (v) good governance.

Furthermore, in 2023, Multiversity received the EcoVadis gold medal for sustainability (ranking in the top 5%
globally) and a 7.8 ESG rating from Sustainalytics (ranking in the top 2% globally). In the same year,
Multiversity also achieved significant results in low scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions (0.005 tCO2e per student and
1.44 tCO2e per employee), and holds key sustainability certifications such as ISO 9001 (quality management
systems) and ISO 14001 (environmental management systems).


-----

**Insurance**

Multiversity maintains insurance cover in respect of various insurable risks under a range of insurance policies,
including in particular the civil liabilities of its directors and officers, members of its management and
supervisory bodies.

Mercatorum also maintains existing insurance policies covering fire risks and theft risks, as well as damage
caused to third parties and damage caused to Mercatorum’s employees.

Pegaso also maintain existing insurance policies covering damages to third parties and damage caused to
Pegaso’s employees.

San Raffaele also maintains existing insurance policies covering damages to third parties and damages caused to
San Raffaele’s employees.

**Litigation and legal, tax and administrative proceedings**

**_General_**

From time to time, Multiversity is subject to legal or administrative proceedings or claims arising in the ordinary
course of our business, including claims from employees and former students.

The provision made for disputes in the 2023/2022 Consolidated Financial Statements is equal to €600 thousand,
which includes the risk of loss of ongoing disputes. Such amount has been allocated on the basis of the merits of
the relevant case, as advised by counsel.

_Administrative proceedings_

An administrative appeal was filed by Mercatorum before the President of the Italian Republic on February 10,
2022 for the annulment of Ministerial Decree no. 1154/2021 and Director Decree no. 2711/2022. The
proceeding has been transferred before TAR Lazio – Roma, with registration no. 4845/2022. The action is still
pending and Mercatorum is still waiting for the public hearing to be scheduled.

_Tax audit by the Italian Tax Police_

On January 12, 2024, a tax audit was commenced by the Italian Tax Police (Guardia di Finanza) against
Pegaso, following an invitation to appear at their premises served on December 19, 2023, concerning direct
taxes and VAT in connection with the financial years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, with
specific reference to the tax treatment of the working relationship with the visiting professors (professori
_straordinari). The Italian Tax Police’s investigation and document acquisition activities are in progress and,_
with the support of Pegaso’s tax advisors, Pegaso is promptly responding to the requests and questions raised by
promptly providing the agency with legal and tax supporting documentation. As of the date hereof, the tax audit
has not been concluded and no report of findings has been drawn up yet by the Italian revenue agency.

Other than as stated above, Multiversity is not currently subject to any material legal, governmental, tax or
arbitration proceedings that it believes could reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The outcome of legal
proceedings, however, can be difficult to predict with certainty, and Multiversity can offer no assurances in this
regard.

**REGULATION**

The following provides a brief description of the primary regulations that govern the activities carried out by
Multiversity in Italy. Although the following brief description contains the principal information concerning
such regulations that are considered material by the Issuer in the context of the issue of the Notes, it is not an
exhaustive account of all applicable laws and regulations. References and discussions to laws, treaties,
regulations and other administrative and regulatory documents are entirely qualified by the full text of such
laws, treaties, regulations and other administrative and regulatory documents themselves. In addition,
prospective investors and/or their advisers should make their own full analysis of the legislation and regulations
which apply in the other countries where Multiversity operates and of the impact they may have on an
investment in the Notes and should not rely on the content of the following paragraphs only. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Business and Industry.”_

**Regulation**

The implementation of national regulations on online universities was encouraged at European level with the
European Resolution 2001/C 204/02) of 13 July 2001 issued by the European Council on e-Learning. This
Resolution invited both Members State and the European Commission to consider adopting a series of actions
aimed at implementing and strengthening the e-Learning system in the educational sector, as well as to seek new
learning methods and approaches, and promote virtual mobility and transnational campus projects.

The European Parliament and the European Council later, pursuant to Decision No. 2318/2003/CE of December
5, 2003 aimed to support the initiatives of the EU Member States in the field of distance learning, with the
effective integration of information and communications technologies (“ICT”) systems in education and
training, prioritizing the university as a sector of focus.

Following a proposal made by the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (“ENQA“)
in cooperation with the European Students’ Union (“ESU”), the Ministers responsible for higher education
adopted the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (“EHEA”)
in 2005 and revised the standards in May 2015 (the “2015 ESG”). The 2015 ESG are a set of standards and
guidelines for internal and external assurance of quality in higher education and are focused on ensuring the
quality of learning and teaching in higher education, including learning and appropriate links with research and
innovation.

In this respect, the purposes of the 2015 ESG are to:

(i) improve the educational offering for EHEA students;

(ii) help higher education institutions manage and improve their quality and thereby justify their autonomy;

(iii) provide for work carried out by quality assurance agencies; and

(iv) make external quality assurance more transparent and easier to understand by all stakeholders.

**_The Regulatory Context of Online Universities_**

Online universities (“Università telematiche”) began in Italy after Article 26 of Law no. 289 of December 27,
2002 entered into force, as implemented by the Ministerial Decree dated April 17, 2003, issued by MIUR and
the Italian Ministry for Innovation and Technologies (“Ministero per l’Innovazione e le Tecnologie”), the socalled “Moratti-Stanca” Decree.

To acquire the relevant authorization, online universities shall:

- implement a flexible organizational structure allowing the use of different technologies to properly
manage different activities;

- promote a consistent and teaching-tailored integration of teaching support services;


-----

- ensure the selection, planning and design of adequate e-learning resources for each coursework;

- ensure adequate resources exist for the administration and management of disseminating teaching
resources, including through the offer of articulate tailored teletutoring service; and

- ensure adequate procedures for knowledge assessment; provide for research and development of
innovative e-learning systems capable of supporting the dissemination of multimedia data linked to the
range of learning products offered.

Since 2004, 11 online universities have been established and obtained the relevant authorization
(“accreditamento”) with the MIUR, before a ban was imposed on the establishment of new online universities
(most recently pursuant to Decree 289, which extended the ban to the period 2021-2023).

**_DM 2021 and most recent development in the regulatory framework of telematic universities_**

On October 14, 2021, the new Ministerial Decree 1154/2021 regarding the self-evaluation, evaluation, initial
and periodic accreditation of study centers and courses (“DM 2021”) issued by the MIUR was published on the
Italian official gazette and replaced Ministerial Decree no. 6 of January 7, 2019 (“Decree 6”), as of the
2022/2023 academic year. Such decree, among other things and in line with industry guidelines, introduced
changes to the existing educational standards, specifically altering the requirements necessary for teaching staff
and revising the approach used to determine the ratio of lecturers to students

In particular, pursuant to Article 10, paragraph 2 of the DM 2021, for study courses accredited within the
academic year 2021/2022 that do not meet the minimum teaching requirements as stipulated by this decree,
universities may sign plans to achieve the aforementioned teaching requirements (piani di raggiungimento)
according to the procedures indicated in Article 4 of this decree. These requirements must be met within a
timeframe not exceeding the standard duration of the courses plus an additional two years. The DM 2021 was
followed by Directorial Decree 2711/2021 (“DD 2711”), which specified the timeframe for the check of the
requirements. The plans for achieving the teaching requirements must be met, for study courses already
accredited, no later than: (i) the 2026/2027 academic year for three-year study courses; (ii) the 2025/2026
academic year for two-year study courses; (iii) the 2028/2029 academic year for five-year study courses; and
(iv) the 2029/2030 academic year for six-year academic courses.

Based on Article 3, paragraph 5 of the DM 2021, in the case of an educational offering that includes plans to
meet the teaching requirements for more than a quarter of the study programs, the university will have a socalled “conditional accreditation.” Furthermore, Article 4, paragraph 3, of DM 2021 also stipulates that in no
case accreditation for additional study courses can be granted if there are plans to meet the teaching
requirements for over a quarter of the accredited study programs. For example, if a university, following the expost verification for the 2021/2022 academic year, wishes to maintain accreditation for an educational offering
equivalent to 12 study programs, of which 4 or more have a plan to meet the teaching requirements, it will not
be able to propose accreditation for any new courses for the 2022/2023 academic year. A similar limitation
finally applies to universities with a “conditional accreditation”, regardless of the number of courses for which
there is a plan to meet the teaching requirements.

However, Article 2, paragraph 6 of the DD 2711 clarified that the execution of plans to meet the teaching
requirements for courses already accredited by the 2021/2022 academic year does not impose for that academic
year the limitations set out in Article 4, paragraph 3, of the DM 2021 concerning the number of new study
courses that can be accredited, provided that all courses at least meet the most favorable minimum conditions
for the number of the teaching staff among alternatively provided by Decree 6 or the DM 2021.

Against the DM 2021, all the telematic Universities filed appeals to the Lazio Regional Administrative Court,
with a request for precautionary measures, all with substantially similar content. The relative judgments were
decided on 21 December 2022, the appeals were rejected. The same outcome was achieved in the subsequent
proceedings before the Council of State with its ruling of February 5, 2024, which, in rejecting the appeals,
however, expressed warnings to the MIUR regarding the need to envisage specific regulations on the operation
of telematic universities, which it recognized as having specific characteristics that the legislator will have to
take into account when regulating the case.

In light of the above, Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele approved in 2022 the plans to achieve the teaching
requirements (piani di raggiungimento) for some study courses. For further details, please refer to the specific


-----

sections below “Plans to achieve the teaching requirements (piani di raggiungimento) according to DM 2021”
under each university).

Furthermore, with the MIUR Decree No. 249/2022, the “Technical Table of Non-State Telematic Universities”
(the “Technical Table”) has been established to initiate a dialogue with non-state telematic universities on
issues of specific interest to them, with particular regard to the definition of educational offerings, the guarantee
of quality and sustainability of education, and the use of the most modern e-learning technologies, also in
consideration of the international benchmark. The “Technical Table” is chaired by the Minister of University
and Research and composed of representatives of the competent institutions in the university and research
sector, as well as representatives of non-state telematic universities.

The main issue addressed by the technical table is of particular interest for telematic universities, as it is the
economic sustainability of the forecasts of the DM 2021 for telematic universities, which have submitted
(through the newly formed Association “UNITED”) a proposal for reformulation, asking for the restoration of
the method of calculating the need for tenured teachers (docenti di ruolo) contained in the previous Decree 6,
returning to the multiplication by three of the student numbers, due to the different educational model. The
MIUR has announced in a very recent meeting that it will soon present a revised proposal of the DM 2021 to the
technical table. By the first half of the year 2024, the Technical Table set up should lead to a review of the
minimum teaching requirements laid down in the DM 2021. The review is envisaged to result in a reduction of
the number of teachers for the study courses and also a possible extension of the terms for the implementation of
the plans to achieve the teaching requirements.

The “Technical Table” should also address the issuing of the next three-year planning decree that will replace
Decree 289, according to Article 1-ter of Law 43/2005. The aforementioned university programs specifically
identify: a) the courses of study to be established and activated in compliance with the essential minimum
requirements in terms of structural and human resources, as well as those to be suppressed; b) the program for
the development of scientific research; c) actions to support and enhance services and interventions for students;
d) internationalization programs; e) the staffing needs for both fixed-term and permanent teaching and nonteaching personnel, including the use of mobility.

**Law No. 33/2022**

Italy has introduced significant changes to its higher education system with Law no. 33, dated April 12, 2022,
and the subsequent MIUR Decree No. 930 of July 29, 2022 (“Decree 930”). These reforms mark a departure
from the longstanding prohibition, in place since 1933, against dual enrollment in higher education courses. The
new regulations now allow students to pursue two degrees concurrently within the same time frame. The Decree
930 clarifies that students can enrol in two different degree programs at the same time. This can include
combinations of bachelor's and master's degree programs, which can be undertaken at different universities,
schools, or higher education institutes, whether they are Italian or international. The decree also extends this
flexibility to simultaneous enrolment in university courses and courses at AFAM institutions (Higher Education
in Art and Music), with the limitation of two enrolments at a time.

Furthermore, students are now permitted to enrol in a combination of a bachelor’s or master's degree program
with a master's, Ph.D., or specialization course, with the exception of medical specialization courses. Enrollment
in a doctoral program alongside a medical specialization course is also allowed. However, the decree sets a
boundary to ensure diversity in education by not allowing dual enrolment in two bachelor's or master's degree
courses that belong to the same class of study, unless the curricula of the two courses differ by at least twothirds of their educational activities. This ensures that the two degrees pursued are distinct and cover a broad
educational spectrum.

**Law 79/2022**

The Italian educational system has undergone a significant reform with Law 79/2022 (which converted Law
Decree No. 26/2022 and amended Legislative Decree No. 59/2017), which mandates a new initial training
pathway for aspiring teachers. This pathway requires a minimum of 60 university or academic training credits
(CFU). The Prime Ministerial Decree (DPCM) of 4 August 2023, later published, outlines the structure for these
initial teacher training courses for secondary schools. Universities and AFAM (Alta Formazione Artistica,
_Musicale e Coreutica) institutions can offer 30 or 36 CFU courses only after their corresponding 60 CFU course_
has been accredited. The accreditation process involves a decree from the Minister of University and Research,
based on a compliant opinion from ANVUR. For the 2023/2024 and 2024/2025 academic years, these courses


-----

can be delivered online, with synchronous methods, for up to 50% of the total course time. The 60 CFU are
divided into three training areas: pedagogical-didactic, disciplinary, and professional. Certain telematic
universities, such as Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele, are collaborating with traditional universities to
establish Inter-university Centres. These centres are designed to be accredited for the new university pathway as
per Law 79/2022. The Multiversity Group's universities have successfully had their centres accredited, with
Pegaso and others requesting to operate in various territorial areas and competition classes. With ministerial
decrees no. 620 and 621 published on April 24, 2024, the MIUR launched the initial and qualifying trainings
pathways for the teachers, authorising the allocation of 4,337 places to Pegaso, Mercatorum and San Raffaele.

The implementation of the plan to achieve teaching requirements on the Group’s operations and financial
performance to be monitored and may lead to a progressive increase of the teaching cost base over 5 years and
eventually may lead to improving the quality and reputation of the academics in the sector. See further “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Business and Industry.”_

_Courses that can be provided by online universities_

Pursuant to Decree 289, online universities are allowed to provide:

- distance learning courses, where over two thirds of the educational activities are delivered at a distance;
and

- distance learning courses provided entirely at distance, where all the educational activities are delivered
at a distance, save for exams and discussions relating to final tests, which are taken in person.

Online universities cannot therefore setup classes for courses for which only a mixed mode of delivery is
envisaged (i.e. when distance learning does not exceed two thirds of all educational activities) and cannot set up
courses in the Medicine, Dentistry and Health Professions. However, online universities are allowed to offer
courses in a mixed mode of delivery by pairing with traditional universities or highly specialised research
laboratories[147]. As mentioned above, Decree 289, as announced by the Minister of University and Research, is
about to be replaced for the next three-year educational planning (2024-2026 academic years).

_Academic degrees that can be granted by online universities_

Pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 2 of the “Moratti-Stanca” Decree, online universities can issue the following
academic diplomas and degrees as prescribed by Article 3 of the MIUR Decree No. 270 of October 22, 2004:

- Degree (“Laurea”);

- Master’s Degree (as defined by Ministerial Decree 270/2004, which updated the Ministerial Decree
No. 509 of November 3, 1999) (“Laurea specialistica”);

- Specialization Diploma (“Diploma di specializzazione”);

- Ph.D. (“Dottorato di ricerca”); and

- first-and second-level master study programmes.

Additionally, all three universities are accredited to provide the academic diplomas and decrees described above
for teachers.

However, online universities cannot:

- grant academic degrees in courses relating to health professions; or

147 [CUN opinion dated September 28, 2016 (https://www.cun.it/uploads/6359/Parere_28_09_2016.pdf?v=)](http://www.cun.it/uploads/6359/Parere_28_09_2016.pdf?v=))


-----

- establish professionally oriented degree courses[148] as defined in Article 8, paragraph 2 of Ministerial
Decree No. 987 of December 12, 2016 and in Ministerial Decree No. 446 of August 12, 2020.

_The ANVUR “Periodic Accreditation Process”_

After obtaining the initial authorization, online universities need to undergo a “Periodic accreditation process”
(the “Periodic Accreditation Process”) conducted by ANVUR.

The Periodic Accreditation Process consists of a verification by ANVUR, using remote documentary review
combined with on-site visits, to confirm that the requirements necessary for the initial accreditation of the online
university still remain effective as well as to confirm that the online universities provide quality, efficient and
effective educational activities. The verification process takes into consideration:

- periodic reports online universities prepare regarding their compliance, on an ongoing basis, with the
requirements that led to their initial accreditation[149]. The information to be included in such reports is
listed in Annex E of Ministerial Decree no. 6 of January 7, 2019 (“Decree 6”); and

- the “Indicators of Quality Assurance” in Annex C and E of DM 2021.

The “Indicators of Quality Assurance” are specified in the guidelines issued by ANVUR pursuant to the 2015
ESG and are aimed at confirming compliance with the following requirements:

- _R1 Requirement: vision, strategies and policies of the university relating to the quality of teaching and_
research;

- _R1T Requirement for on-line universities:_ methods of delivery for distance learning and related
technological equipment required and used;

- _R2 Requirement: effectiveness of university policies for quality assurance (“AQ”);_

- _R3 Requirement: quality of educational courses; and_

- _Requirement 4: quality of research and third mission._

Further technical requirements for periodic accreditation of remote educational courses are envisaged, including:

- planning and organization of teachers and tutors;

- teaching interaction and formative assessments for telematics courses;

- staff qualification and provision of teaching materials for telematics courses;

- assessment of student learning outcomes;

- system integration; and

- quality of teaching interaction.

For the purpose of the Periodic Accreditation Process, ANVUR shall also take into account the following
criteria, according to Article 3 of DM 2021:

- the annual report, prepared by the university’s Evaluation Team (“Nucleo di Valutazione”), concerning
the outcomes from their ongoing monitoring and quality control of teaching procedures and research;

148 Professionally oriented degree programs are degree programs that include laboratory activities for at least 48 CFU alongside
another 48 CFU for internship-related activities.

149 Please refer to Article 9, paragraph 2, of Legislative Decree no. 19 of January 27, 2012.


-----

- evaluation of information outlined in the “Unique Annual Form” (“Schede Uniche Annuali”) relating to
courses and research activities; and

- indicators provided for the periodic evaluation referred to in Article 6 of the DM 2021 and results
achieved in relation to the objectives of the three-year planning pursuant to Article 1-ter of the
legislative decree of 31 January 2005, no. 7, converted by Law of 31 March 2005, no. 43.

Thus, based on the above-mentioned criteria, ANVUR shall assess the degree of satisfaction of the Indicators of
Quality Assurance referred to in Annexes C and E of DM 2021. In particular, such requirements implement and
mirror the recommendations envisaged by the 2015 ESG, thereby establishing guidelines for the proper
development of national and institutional quality assurance systems across the EHEA, including cross-border
cooperation.

Pursuant to Article 3 of DM 2021, periodic accreditation of educational premises (sedi) is accredited to those
premises meeting the requirements for initial accreditation in Annex B (i.e., transparency and integrity) together
with the quality requirements in Annex C, following verification by ANVUR on the basis of outcomes from onsite visits carried out by the Commission of Experts for Evaluation (“Commissione di Esperti per la
_Valutazione”_ or “Commission of Experts for Evaluation”).

Pursuant to Article 5 of DM 2021, periodic accreditation of educational courses is granted to courses meeting
the requirements for initial accreditation together with those set out in Annex C; this also takes into account the
periodic evaluation indicators in Annex E. The verification of these requirements is carried out remotely by
ANVUR and is also based on activities of the Evaluation Units (“NUV”).

The outcome of the verification process proposed by ANVUR in relation to the premises is graduated as
follows: (i) “fully satisfactory accreditation” – validity: 5 years; (ii) satisfactory accreditation – validity: 5 years;
(iii) “conditioned accreditation” – validity 1 or 2 years (in any case no longer than 4 years, otherwise the
premises are suppressed); and (iv) no accreditation (entailing the suppression of the premises).

In relation to the periodic accreditation of the study courses, in the event of a positive outcome by ANVUR., the
duration of the periodic accreditation of the courses is automatically extended until the end of the periodic
accreditation of the premises. In the event of critical issues identified or upon notification by the MIUR, the
ANVUR will conduct a detailed evaluation of the course: (i) if the outcome is positive, the duration of the
accreditation is automatically extended until the end of the premises’ accreditation; and (ii) if the outcome is
negative, the accreditation is revoked, and the course is terminated by a specific MIUR decree.

In cases where the periodic review of active courses within a premises reveals significant issues for a substantial
part of them, the MIUR, after consulting the ANVUR, may also request the advancement of the periodic
accreditation visit of the location.

The Periodic Accreditation Process is carried out every five years on universities, and every three years on
educational courses. The duration of the periodic accreditation of the premises may be reduced in relation to the
critical issues that emerged in the periodic review of the study courses, according to Article 5 of DM 2021. The
periodic accreditation of the main premises entails the periodic accreditation of all its study programs and any
decentralized locations, with the exception of those that have been negatively evaluated and therefore
suppressed.

_The ANVUR Research Quality Assessment_

Since its establishment, ANVUR has assessed the quality of the research produced by universities and research
institutions, mainly using peer review, as prescribed by the Presidential Decree no. 76 of February 1, 2010
(Article 3, paragraphs 1(a) and 2(b)).

The Research Quality Assessment (“Valutazione della Qualità della Ricerca” or “VQR”) evaluates the research
conducted by public universities and research institutions; private institutions voluntarily submit their research
for evaluation. The VQR provides an up-to-date assessment of the state of research in various scientific fields, in
order to promote improvements to research quality in the institutions under scrutiny and to allocate
performance- based shares of the Ordinary Financing Fund for the Italian university system (“Fondo di
_Finanziamento Ordinario” or “FFO”)._


-----

Currently, VQR is carried out every five years (pursuant to Law No. 232) once a special decree is issued by the
MIUR establishing the guidelines for the VQR and providing the resources necessary to carry out this research
assessment exercise.

The most recently available results are those from the second VQR (covering the years 2011-2014), published in
February 2017. The third VQR (covering the years 2015-2019) was launched with the approval of the
Ministerial Decrees No. 1110 of November 29, 2019 and of August 11, 2020; the findings have been published
in July 2022. In preparation for the VQR 2020-2024 exercise, ANVUR prepared an analytical report to deepen
the results obtained. Based on the results of the report, an independent group of international experts was then
entrusted with the task of preparing a further report that provided a critical analysis of the VQR 2015-2019
exercise conducted by ANVUR, in light of the best international experiences. The fourth evaluation exercise
(VQR 2020-2024: concerning the publication years 2020-2024) was launched with the DM 998 of August 1,
2023 and is still ongoing.

**Pegaso**

Pegaso was established as an online university by a MIUR Decree given on April 20, 2006 and was initially
authorised to setup and provide the following courses:

- Law (Class LMG/01), within the Faculty of Law; and

- Education and Formation Sciences (Class L-19), within the Faculty of Human Sciences.

In the following years, Pegaso acquired the authorization to provide eleven further courses, namely:

- Civil Engineering (Class L-7);

_2021 and most recent development in the regulatory framework of telematic universities” above._

**_Results of the ANVUR Periodic Authorization Process_**

During the last Periodic Authorization Process (concluded with MIUR Decree of February 25, 2019), Pegaso
obtained the result “Satisfactory” based on a score of 5.55[154] (i.e. level “C-Tel” under paragraph 3 of Article 3 of
Decree 6).

The evaluation process lasted around 8 months. In addition to the university-wide QA system, four courses
(Civil Engineering, Exercise Sciences, Economic Science and Law) and two faculties (Law and Human
Sciences) were assessed. The final report of the Commission of Experts for Evaluation was submitted to
ANVUR on April 30, 2018.

By means of decision No. 294/2021, ANVUR determined that Pegaso had positively overcome the criticalities
identified by the same ANVUR during the last accreditation procedure (which resulted in Ministerial Decree
No. 143/2019) in relation to the study courses L-7 Civil Engineering, L-22 Sports Sciences, LMG-01 Law and
LM-56 Economical Science. Furthermore, ANVUR with resolution no.89 of April 27, 2022, has determined that
the issues reported regarding the periodic accreditation procedure for the LM-56 study course have been
addressed and resolved.

**_Results of the ANVUR Periodic Authorization Process_**

During the last Periodic Authorization Process, Mercatorum obtained a 5.51 rating.

Nucleus is working on monitoring the criticisms and presenting ANVUR with a report to objectively asset out
how the criticisms will be addressed.


-----

The evaluation process lasted around 8 months. In addition to the university-wide QA system, all three courses
(Tourism Sciences, Business Management and Management) and the Economics faculty were assessed. The
final report of the Commission of Experts for Evaluation was submitted to ANVUR on February 22, 2018.

Mercatorum obtained positive evaluations of:

- the adequacy of teaching and research policies;

- planning of courses of study and updates of the same;

- establishing an internal research register; and

- its strategy for the third mission.

On 1 February 2024, due to ongoing organizational changes, consisting in the establishment of three courses
(Economic and Legal Sciences, Technological Sciences and Innovation, Social Sciences and Communication)
and the creation of four departments, Mercatorum successfully requested ANVUR to postpone the site visit
originally scheduled for December 2024 to Spring 2025 for the purposes of the periodic accreditation of the
premises. Mercatorum is still waiting to receive the resolution with the new site visit date.

_Establishment of Pegaso and Mercatorum_

According to their respective by-laws, both Pegaso and Mercatorum qualify as private entities pursuant to
Article 1, para. 2 of the Royal Decree No. 1592/1933, having legal personality and, in the case of Mercatorum,
with the aim of pursuing public purposes. As for all the Italian universities, under article 33 of the Constitution
of the Republic of Italy, Pegaso and Mercatorum have didactic, organizational, administrative, financial and
disciplinary autonomy.

To pursue their respective institutional purposes, Pegaso and Mercatorum have, according to Article 26 of Law
No. 289/2002 and ministerial decree of April 17, 2003, the primary task of carrying out, in addition to research
and study activities, training activities through the use of distance learning methodologies with particular regard
to e-learning applications.

Pegaso is promoted and supported by Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. whereas Mercatorum is promoted
and supported by the company Unimercatorum S.r.l., (each a “Promoter”). Pursuant to the by-laws of each of
Pegaso and Mercatorum and of each Promoter, each institution’s Promoter shall ensure the pursuit of the
relevant university’s institutional objectives and provide the means and any specific services as may be
necessary, indispensable and instrumental, also through the provision of funding and/or arrangements with
suppliers, for the functioning and pursuit of the relevant university’s institutional purposes.

The by-laws also provide that each university may also regulate its relationship with its Promoter by means of a
specific agreement in order to pursue its institutional purpose and the related means and specific services as may
be necessary, indispensable or instrumental, for its functioning and the pursuit of its institutional purposes.
Pegaso and Mercatorum each have in place specific agreements/arrangements with their respective Promoters
that serve to guarantee the financial capability of the universities and, as a consequence, ensure the continuity of
their didactic activities. Since Mercatorum recorded a net profit for the 2020 financial year, thereby concluding
it with a positive net equity and achieving full economic and financial balance, it recognized the amount
required to be calculated under the promotion and support agreement to the Promoter in the profit and loss
statement. The contribution is accounted as a cost in Mercatorum and as income in Unimercatorum s.r.l., with
no effect at consolidation level. As a consequence, the income of Mercatorum remains within the Group.

Further to the reorganization in 2019, Pegaso was transformed into a private corporation (see “Transformation
_of Pegaso into a private corporation” below), whereas Mercatorum remains a non-commercial entity._

_Transformation of Pegaso into a private corporation_

On November 19, 2018, Pegaso’s board of directors resolved upon the transformation of Pegaso, as a private
online university, into a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) named “Università
Telematica Pegaso S.r.l.”, and the relevant amendments to the by-laws in order to effect such change.


-----

With its note No. 5726 of November 20, 2018, Pegaso notified the MIUR of the abovementioned resolution, in
order to obtain its favorable opinion. Given the complexity of such decision, the MIUR, with its note No. 645 of
January 14, 2019, informed Pegaso that the approval of the transformation should have been subject to the prior
opinion of the Council of State (i.e. the Supreme Administrative Court).

In the plenary assembly (adunanza plenaria) of May 9, 2019, the Council of State granted its favorable opinion
confirming that the current legislation on universities set out under the Royal Decree No. 1592/1933 (as
subsequently amended) applies also to private universities transformed into private corporations. However, in
the absence of a specific regulatory framework on the implementation of the corporate models with regard to
universities, the Council of State, required an intervention by the Italian Legislator aimed at realigning and
reorganising the sector following and as a result of the introduction of the new possible corporation structure of
private universities, as recognized by the Decision of the Council of State which was not in this orientation
initially issued. A partial modification was made with the inclusion for the first time in the 2020 Italian Budget
Law (Legge di Bilancio 2020), in article 1, paragraph 721, concerning the treatment of non-public universities
for the purposes of income taxes, of a provision for legally recognized free non-public universities not
constituted in the legal form of commercial companies. Postulating, therefore, already _de facto_ existence. In
light of this, the Council of State recommended that the Government should further evaluate whether to propose
legislative reforms before the Parliament, also to the consolidated text referred to in Royal Decree no.
1592/1933, in order update the regulatory framework and adapt it better to the transformation of open private
universities into private corporations. See further “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Business and
_Industry—Multiversity is subject to various licensing and accreditation requirements in the jurisdictions in_
_which it operates, and its failure to comply with these requirements could expose Multiversity to financial losses_
_and lead to loss of qualified personnel and students.”_

Following the favorable opinion of the Council of State, the MIUR, with note No. 10282 of June 19, 2019
granted its favorable opinion on said transformation and gave its clearance to the consequential amendment of
the Pegaso’s by-laws.

On June 25, 2019, the procedure for the transformation was positively concluded with the registration of Pegaso
in the companies register (registro delle imprese) as a “limited liability company” and the publication in the
Official Gazette of the Italian Republic of the new Pegaso by-laws.

With reference to the tax regime applicable to Pegaso before its transformation into a private corporation, it has
to be noted that the Italian Legislator – in order to clarify the fiscal nature of “free” (or non-State) universities
established by private initiatives—enacted a special provision of authentic interpretation having retroactive
effect—Article 1, paragraph 721, Law December 27, 2019, n. 160 (hereinafter, the “Provision Of Authentic
**Interpretation”) – according to which, only for income tax purposes, the educational activity carried out by the**
said free universities shall be considered as exercise of State functions by a public body and, therefore, not
relevant (i.e. non-commercial activity) for Italian corporate income tax purposes according to Article 74, para. 2,
let. a of the Presidential Decree of December 22, 1986, No. 917. The above with the consequence that the
concern of the Italian revenue agency (in the context tax audit commenced on November 20, 2019 – see
“Business—Litigation and legal, tax and administrative proceedings”) regarding the non-commercial nature of
Pegaso in the years preceding its transformation should not be grounded as the issue has been expressly
addressed by the Provision Of Authentic Interpretation.

**San Raffaele**

San Raffaele was established as an online university by MIUR Decree no. 134 dated May 8, 2006 published on
the Official Gazette on June 1, 2006 under the name “Università Telematica Internazionale (Unitel).” In 2010, it
changed the name to “San Raffaele.”

It provides the following study courses for the 2023/2024 academic year:

- Industrial Design (Class L-4);

- Administration and Organization Sciences (L-16);

- Sports Sciences (L-22);


-----

- Food and Gastronomy Sciences (L-26);

- Nutritional Science (LM- 61);

- Technics of Preventive and Adapted Sports Activities (LM-67); and

- Management and Business Consulting (LM-77).

The Ph.D. course “Innovative Lifestyle Interventions for Health Promotion” has been accredited by means of
Ministerial Decree no. 1151/2023 for 5 years starting from the 2023/2024 academic year for 3 Ph.D. cycles. In
addition, UTSR offers several master courses and collaborates with other entities for the purposes of _post_
_lauream courses._

Furthermore, San Raffaele is planning to expand the educational offer for the 2024/2025 academic year with the
following courses:

- L-13 Biological Sciences, for which the accreditation procedure is pending; and

- L-2 Biotechnologies and LM-12 Design for Sustainability and Social Innovation, for which a
proceeding concerning the accreditation denial is pending.

More specifically, San Raffaele has initiated legal action against the MIUR to comply with judgement No. 4560
which was issued by the Administrative Regional Court (TAR) of Lazio – Rome on April 19, 2021. The case,
bearing registration number 5547/2022, aims to challenge the denial of accreditation for the course L-2 in
Biotechnologies. This action is currently pending. Additionally, San Raffaele has brought forth an action against
the denial of accreditation for the course “LM-12 Design for Sustainability and Social Innovation.” The TAR of
Lazio rejected the legal actions brought by San Raffaele, with the consequence that the courses cannot be
accredited. However, since it is a first instance judgment, it is possible to challenge it before the Council of State
(Consiglio di Stato).

**Results of the ANVUR Periodic Authorization Process**

Based on final report issued by ANVUR on January 25, 2017, in which ANVUR accredited both San Raffaele
premises and courses with grade “D-TEL”, which meant that the accreditation was conditioned to the
overcoming of the criticalities reported by ANVUR. After the controls held by ANVUR, the grade has been
changed in 2019 to “C-TEL” and consequently judged as satisfactory.

A site visit of the commission of expert evaluators for the periodic accreditation of the premises and study
courses according to the for the purposes of the new model for accreditation “AVA3” will be carried out in the
week of July 1-5, 2024. The procedure requires the university to complete a dedicated platform, the credentials
for which are yet to be transmitted by ANVUR to the university. The initial deadline for the procedure was
April 22, 2024 which was extended to April 29, 2024, due to certain technical issues with the use of the
platform. On this platform, the university is obligated to upload its self-assessment document, which should
address each specified area and point of attention. Additionally, all supporting documentation must be attached.
Furthermore, the university is required to upload a video on its teaching and research facilities.

**Plans to achieve the teaching requirements (piani di raggiungimento) according to DM 2021**

On March 17, 2022 San Raffaele applied for the plans aimed at achieving the teaching requirements for the
following courses:

- L-22 Sports Sciences;

- L-26 Food and Gastronomy Sciences;

- LM-61 Nutritional Science;

- LM-67 Technics of Preventive and Adapted Sports Activities.


-----

The plans relating to courses L-22, L-26, LM-67 are fully completed. The plan related to the study course LM61 is to be completed by November 30, 2025.

may rank pari passu with, or subordinated to, the Revolving Credit Facility, provided that any such additional
facility that is to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility shall be incurred pursuant to the other prong
of the “credit facilities” basket for super senior indebtedness.

The availability, maturity, pricing and other terms of any additional facility will be those agreed between
Multiversity and the relevant lenders of that additional facility, provided that any such additional facility that is
to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility shall have a final maturity date which is no earlier than the
Revolving Credit Facility’s termination date.

thereunder) may, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized from time to time
until the date falling one month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. Any Rollover

from time to time until (and including) the Termination Date for the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

Multiversity is the original borrower and original guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility. A mechanism

Principles and guarantee limitations included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

**_Maturity and Repayment Requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility matures six years and six months from the first date on which both (a) the
completion of the Acquisition occurs and (b) the date on which the gross proceeds of the Notes are used to
complete the Acquisition (the “Closing Date”). Each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All
outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date
for the Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit
Facility may be re-borrowed during its availability period, subject to certain conditions. The termination date for
any additional facility is the date agreed between Multiversity and the relevant lenders (provided that, if the
additional facility ranks _pari passu_ with the Revolving Credit Facility, the termination date cannot be earlier
than the termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility).

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at rates per annum equal to the aggregate of the
applicable margin plus (a) in relation to advances in euro, EURIBOR (subject to a zero floor), (b) in relation to

or interest, insolvency or failure to deliver a compliance certificate under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement such that the margin cannot be determined has occurred and is continuing, the margin on the loans
will be reduced if certain total net leverage ratios (which are to be calculated substantially consistently with the
calculations set forth in the Indenture, as described in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) are met.

If the Closing Date occurs, a commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of
the Revolving Credit Facility from (and including) closing to (and including) the date the Revolving Credit
Facility is drawn and/or cancelled in full at the rate of 30% of the then applicable margin for the Revolving
Credit Facility. The commitment fee will be payable quarterly in arrear, on the last day of the availability period
of the Revolving Credit Facility and (in respect of any cancellation of commitments) on the date any
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are cancelled or on the date on which a lender cancels its
commitment.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

Multiversity is also required to pay customary agency fees to the Agent and the Security Agent in connection
with the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Guarantees_**

Multiversity will provide a senior guarantee on or about the Acquisition Closing Date of all amounts payable to
the Finance Parties by any of its subsidiaries which accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as

a Guarantor Jurisdiction (being Italy) which has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
representing more than 5% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group) (subject to Agreed Security Principles)
accedes to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as an additional guarantor. Subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations—Limitations on Granting Security Interests and Guarantees under Italian Law”, if the_
aggregate of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the guarantors under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement is less than 80% of the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of
the wholly- owned members of the Group incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction (the “Guarantor Coverage
**Test”), Multiversity is also required to ensure that each other member of the Group as may be necessary to**
ensure that the Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied accedes to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as a
guarantor.

Furthermore, if on the last day of a fiscal year of Multiversity, the Guarantor Coverage Test is not met and/or
each Material Company is not a guarantor, Multiversity must, within 120 days of receipt by the Agent of the
annual financial statements (commencing with the first set of annual financial statements delivered for the fiscal
year ending at least six months after the First Coverage Test Date), cause sufficient members of the Group to
accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional guarantors (subject to agreed security
principles and limitations under applicable laws) to ensure that each Material Company accedes as a guarantor
and the Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied.

**_Security_**

The Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes and the Existing Notes will benefit from substantially the same
security, subject to certain accessions to take place in relation to the Intercreditor Agreement as explained
further below.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principes and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility will be
secured by (a) on or about the Closing Date, a share pledge granted by Holdco over the entire issued share
capital of the Issuer (the “Issuer Share Pledge”); and (b) within 10 Business Days following the Closing Date,
the Issuer shall enter into a deed of confirmation and extension in respect of the Existing Target Share Pledge
(as defined below) over the entire issued share capital of the Multiversity (the “Target Share Pledge”, and
together with the Issuer Share Pledge, the “Transaction Security”).

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security
(whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes and the Existing Notes) will be required to be applied to
repay indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and owing to certain hedging counterparties,
the Security Agent, any receiver and certain credit representatives, in priority to the Notes and the Existing
Notes. Any Material Company or other member of the Group located in a Guarantor Jurisdiction which becomes
a guarantor of the Revolving Credit Facility is required (subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles and certain limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”) to_
grant security over shares in any Material Company that is its wholly-owned subsidiary and (if wholly owned by
other members of the Group) to have its shares (or equivalent ownership interests) secured in favor of the
Security Agent (including on a limited recourse basis if the relevant shareholder is not a guarantor). Security is
also to be granted (subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares in any
additional borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility (including on a limited recourse basis if the relevant
shareholder is not a guarantor). Representations and Warranties

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, subject to
certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets, and with
certain representations and warranties being repeated, including: (i) status and incorporation; (ii) binding


-----

obligations; (iii) non-conflict with constitutional documents, laws or other obligations; (iv) power and authority;
(v) validity and admissibility in evidence; (vi) ranking and (vii) accuracy of most recent financial statements
delivered.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments) that apply to the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants. Set forth below is a brief description of
such covenants, all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge or other qualifications,
exceptions and baskets.

_Affirmative Covenants_

The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information, including annual
audited and quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates; (ii) authorizations, (iii) compliance with
laws; (iv) payment of taxes; (v) maintenance of _pari passu_ ranking of the Revolving Credit Facility; (vi)
maintenance of Guarantor Coverage Test, granting of additional guarantees and security in prescribed
circumstances; (vii) access to books, accounts and records in prescribed circumstances only; (viii) further
assurance provisions and (ix) certain conditions subsequent.

_Negative Covenants_

The negative covenants include restrictions, among others, with respect to deliberately changing the center of
main interest of a borrower or guarantor. Otherwise, the negative covenants that will be included in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are substantially the same as the negative covenants in the Indenture. See
“Description of the Notes.”

**_Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control_**

Multiversity is required to notify the Agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement of a Change of
Control, following which each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is entitled to notify
Multiversity requiring repayment of all outstanding amounts owed to that lender and the cancellation of that
lender’s commitments.

**_Financial Covenants_**

There are no maintenance or springing financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for some of the same events of default, with certain
adjustments, as under the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for certain customary events
of default, all of which are subject to customary materiality and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or
grace periods, as appropriate, including: (i) representations or warranties found to be untrue or misleading in any
material respect, which materially and adversely affects the interest of the lenders (taken as a whole) under the
Finance Documents, when made or deemed made subject to a 60-day grace period; (ii) unlawfulness and
invalidity which materially and adversely affects the interest of the lenders (taken as a whole) under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to a 60-day grace period; (iii) failure by a Shareholder Creditor to
comply with a material term of the Intercreditor Agreement which materially and adversely affects the interest
of the lenders (taken as a whole) under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to a 60-day grace
period; and (iv) repudiation and rescission which materially and adversely affects the interest of the lenders
(taken as a whole) under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to a 60-day grace period.

**Existing Notes**

On October 27, 2021, Multiversity (as successor to Paganini Bidco following the 2022 Reverse Merger), issued
€765.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes due 2028 (the “Existing
**Notes”), which remain outstanding as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. The Existing Notes are**
governed by the Existing Indenture. The Existing Notes mature on October 30, 2028.


-----

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Existing Notes are not guaranteed and are secured by the
Existing Target Share Pledge. On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will guarantee the Existing
Notes and the Existing Notes will also be secured by the Issuer Share Pledge.

Prior to October 30, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Existing Notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the applicable “make whole” premium and accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On or after October 30, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Existing Notes at par, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

In connection with any tender offer for the Existing Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Existing Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Existing Notes in such tender
offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the
Existing Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the
right to redeem the Existing Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at
a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Existing Notes in such tender offer.

Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control, each holder of the Existing
Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Existing Notes at a price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated total net
leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event.

The Existing Indenture provides for covenants and events of default that are substantially similar in nature to the
covenants and events of default set out under “Description of the Notes.”

The Existing Notes and the Existing Indenture are governed by the laws of the State of New York.

The Existing Notes are listed and admitted to dealing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

Capitalized terms used in this section shall have the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement
unless otherwise defined.

On October 27, 2021, Multiversity, the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the
“Existing RCF Lenders”), each obligor in respect of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Security
Agent, the trustee in respect of the Existing Notes (in its capacity as creditor representative for the holders of the
Existing Notes) and the Subordinated Creditors, among others, entered into the Intercreditor Agreement to
which the Issuer, Holdco, the Trustee, (in its capacity as creditor representative for the holders of the Notes) and
the other relevant finance parties in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility) shall accede on or around the
Acquisition Closing Date as detailed under the paragraph headed “Parties” below. Certain hedging providers,
Third Party Security Providers and certain subsidiaries of Multiversity (such subsidiaries together with
Multiversity, the “Debtors”) may accede in the future. By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be
deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and shall be
deemed to have authorized the Trustee to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement and which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes following the Trustee’s
accession to the Intercreditor Agreement on the Acquisition Closing Date. It does not restate the Intercreditor
Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the
description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the
Debtors, the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors, when payments can be made in respect
of debt of the Debtors, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that indebtedness, the terms pursuant
to which certain of that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and
turnover provisions. Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict


-----

between the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Indenture, the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.

**_Overview_**

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors party thereto (as defined below);

- the relative ranking of the Transaction Security;

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors party thereto;

- when enforcement action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar
actions) (“Enforcement Action”) can be taken in respect of the Transaction Security (as defined
below);

- provisions relating to the making of any acceleration or demand for payment in respect of the Notes,
the Existing Notes and any Senior Notes;

- the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

- the requirement to turn over amounts received from enforcement of the Transaction Security;

- when the Transaction Security and any guarantee(s) issued by certain Debtors party thereto will be
released to permit an enforcement sale;

- the circumstances in which creditors’ claims (including noteholders’ claims against Multiversity, the
Issuer and/or any Senior Notes Issuer) might be required to be transferred to third parties or released to
assist in enforcement; and

- the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security and other amounts
received by the Security Agent.

**_Parties_**

The principal parties to the Intercreditor Agreement currently are: (i) Paganini Investments S.à r.l. as Original
Shareholder Creditor and Original Third Party Security Provider, (ii) Multiversity (as Original Debtor and
Original Intra-Group Lender), (iii) the agent for the finance parties under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (the “Existing RCF Agent”), (iv) the Existing RCF Lenders, and (v) the Security Agent.

The “Super Senior Creditors” include the Existing RCF Lenders and the Existing RCF Agent (and, upon
accession, any future lenders (“Credit Facility Lenders”) in respect of future credit facilities which rank super
senior as to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security (“Credit Facilities”))
together with, upon accession, the Priority Hedge Counterparties (as defined below). The “Senior Secured
**Creditors” include the holders of the Existing Notes, the Trustee (as trustee in respect of the Existing Notes)**
together with, upon accession, the Non-Priority Hedge Counterparties (as defined below), the Future Pari Passu
Creditors (as defined below) and the Cash Management Facility Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement)[156]. The “Senior Creditors” include, upon accession, any Senior Notes Creditors and the Future
Senior Creditors (as defined below).

156 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Intercreditor Agreement includes a mechanic whereby a Cash Management Facility may be
designated by a debtor as a Credit Facility (and thus giving such Cash Management Facility and relevant Cash Management
Facility Creditors super senior status as to the proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security. Accordingly, certain
concepts where referred to in the Intercreditor Agreement (and hence in this summary) in respect of any such cash management
facility may also constitute more than one defined term used in the Intercreditor Agreement (and hence in this summary)
including, without limitation, Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date and Cash Management Facility Discharge Date) (a Dual
**Term Concept). Where an existence of a Dual Term Concept in the Intercreditor Agreement would give rise to any**
inconsistency or ambiguity, or where the two relevant defined terms cannot co-exist or both be true, when interpreting the


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement therefore allows for accession by certain future creditors in order to share (to the
extent set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) in the relevant security, including (i) hedge counterparties
pursuant to hedging agreements which are secured on a super senior basis with (among other liabilities) the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility (the “Priority Hedging Agreements” and the providers thereof the
“Priority Hedge Counterparties”), (ii) hedge counterparties pursuant to hedging agreements which are secured
on a pari passu basis with (with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of security (among other liabilities)) the
Existing Notes (the “Non-Priority Hedging Agreements” and the providers thereof, the “Non-Priority Hedge
**Counterparties” and together with the Priority Hedge Counterparties, the “Hedge Counterparties”), (iii)**
creditors of future loan or bond indebtedness of the Debtors (which is permitted by or not restricted under the
terms of, _inter alia, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indenture and any Senior_
Notes Indenture (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), and which is not subordinated in right of payment
to the liabilities owed to the Super Senior Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors) (the “Future Pari Passu
**Debt”), including any senior secured notes issued after the Issue Date pursuant to the Indenture (the “Future**
**Pari Passu Creditors”) and (iv) creditors of future loan or bond indebtedness of the Debtors (which is**
permitted by or not restricted under the terms of, inter alia, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing
Indenture and any Senior Notes Indenture (if any), and which is _pari passu_ with respect to the proceeds of
enforcement of security, and not subordinated in right of payment to, the liabilities owed to the Senior Creditors)
(“Future Senior Debt”), including any senior notes issued after the Issue Date pursuant to a Senior Notes
Indenture (the “Future Senior Creditors”).

Neither Multiversity nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (each a member of the “Group”) nor any shareholder
of a member of the Group which is not otherwise party to (1) a document creating security in favor of the Super
Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Creditors or (2) the debt documents thereby
secured, will be party to the Intercreditor Agreement save for (i) any direct or indirect shareholder of
Multiversity which has made a loan to a member of the Group (each a “Shareholder Creditor”) (the
Intercreditor Agreement contains customary subordination provisions and restrictions relating to the receivables
owing from any Senior Notes Issuer or any member of the Group to any Shareholder Creditor (the
“Shareholder Liabilities”)) (ii) any holding company of Multiversity which is designated a “Parent Borrower”
by Multiversity under the Intercreditor Agreement (each a “Holdco Lender”) which has made a loan to
Multiversity(the “Holdco Liabilities”) and (iii) certain members of the Group that lend to another member of
the Group (each an “Intragroup Lender”) that will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the
loans or indebtedness owing from such members of the Group to such Intra-Group Lenders in respect of intragroup loans (the “Intra- Group Liabilities”). The Intercreditor Agreement contains subordination provisions
relating to any Subordinated Liabilities. However, members of the Group will not be prohibited from incurring,
amending or making payments in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities until an acceleration event under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility or the Existing Indenture is continuing and at any time prior to such
acceleration event, such Intra-Group Liabilities may be converted into equity (subject to certain security being
granted where required).

On or around the Acquisition Closing Date: (i) the Issuer will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor
(and shall be designated as a Parent Borrower in respect of the Notes), (ii) HoldCo will accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement as a Third Party Security Provider, (iii) the Trustee will, in relation to the Notes, accede
to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Future Pari Passu Debt Representative and Future Pari Passu Creditor, (iv)
the Existing RCF Lenders rolling their commitments into the Revolving Facility Agreement and any other
lender under the Revolving Facility Agreement that is not already a party to the Intercreditor Agreement will
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Credit Facility Lender, and (v) the Existing RCF Agent, which will
appointed as the facility agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, will accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement in respect of its capacity as the creditor representative for the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility (the “RCF Agent”). Thereafter, the Notes will share (to the extent set out in the Intercreditor
Agreement) in the Transaction Security described herein with the creditors under the Existing Notes, the
Revolving Credit Facility and creditors of any future loan or bond indebtedness of the Debtors (which is
permitted under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).

The remainder of this section summarises the Intercreditor Agreement after the relevant accessions described in
the preceding paragraph have taken place and following the refinancing of the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility with the Revolving Credit Facility and the designation of the liabilities under the Revolving Credit
Facility as Super Senior Liabilities.

Intercreditor Agreement, the relevant defined term corresponding or relating to Credit Facilities (i.e. Super Senior Liabilities)
shall prevail for all purposes.


-----

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Indebtedness_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities of the Debtors shall rank in right and priority of
payment in the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

(a) _first, the liabilities owed to the Super Senior Creditors (the “Super Senior Liabilities”) (which will_
include liabilities owed to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and any references to “Super
Senior Liabilities” below shall, for the avoidance of doubt, include such liabilities under the Revolving
Credit Facility, and related terms shall be interpreted accordingly), the liabilities owed to the Senior
Secured Creditors with respect to the Existing Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities”), the
liabilities owed to any Hedge Counterparty (the “Hedging Liabilities”) (to the extent not already
included in the Super Senior Liabilities), the liabilities owed to the Cash Management Facility
Creditors (the “Cash Management Facility Liabilities”), the liabilities of any Senior Notes Issuer in
respect of any Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities”), the Future Pari Passu Debt (which
will include liabilities owed to the noteholders of the Notes and any references to “Future Pari Passu
Debt” below shall include such liabilities under the Notes, and related terms shall, for the avoidance of
doubt, be interpreted accordingly), the Future Senior Debt of any future issuer of senior debt to the
Future Senior Creditors (the “Future Senior Issuer Liabilities”), and certain customary costs and
expenses of the Trustee and any Senior Notes Trustee (the “Trustee Liabilities”) _pari passu_ and
without any preference between them;

(b) _second, the guarantee liabilities owed to the Senior Creditors with respect to any Senior Notes (the_
“Senior Notes Guarantee Liabilities” and, together with any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities, the
“Senior Notes Liabilities”), together with any guarantee liabilities owed to any Future Senior Creditor
_pari passu and without any preference between them;_

(c) _third, the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Holdco Liabilities_ _pari passu_ and without any preference
between them; and

(d) _fourth, the Shareholder Liabilities, pari passu and without any preference between them._

The Intercreditor Agreement contains an acknowledgment by all parties thereto that any Senior Notes Issuer
Liabilities and the Future Senior Issuer Liabilities are senior obligations of the relevant issuer, and provides that
nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall impair the right of the Senior Creditors to institute suit for the
recovery of any payment due by such an issuer in respect of any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities or the Future
Senior Issuer Liabilities (as applicable), but provides that the Senior Creditors shall not, until the Senior Secured
Discharge Date, take any steps to appropriate the assets of such an issuer subject to the Transaction Security in
connection with any Enforcement Action other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Priority of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security provided for the liabilities described in paragraphs (a)
and (b) below (the “Transaction Security”) shall rank and secure these liabilities in the following order (and
subject to the proceeds of such security being distributed in accordance with the Payments Waterfall defined
below):

(a) _first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities (to the_
extent not already included in the Super Senior Liabilities), the Cash Management Facility Liabilities,
the Future Pari Passu Debt and the Trustee Liabilities, pari passu and without any preference between
them (but only to the extent that such Transaction Security expressed to secure those liabilities); and

(b) _second, any Senior Notes Liabilities and the Future Senior Debt pari passu and without any preference_
between them (but only to the extent that such Transaction Security is Shared Security (which term
shall include, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, certain other security as may be granted
in the future and designated by Multiversity as “Shared Security”)).

The Intercreditor Agreement further provides that any security provided for any Senior Notes only (of which
there is none as of the date of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Issue Date) (the “Senior Notes Only


-----

**Security”) shall rank and secure only any Senior Notes Liabilities and the Future Senior Debt, pari passu and**
without any preference between them (but only to the extent that such Senior Notes Only Security is expressed
to secure such liabilities).

The Shareholder Liabilities, the Holdco Liabilities and the Intra-Group Liabilities (the “Subordinated
**Liabilities”) shall not be secured by the Transaction Security or any Senior Notes Only Security.**

If security is to be granted for certain future indebtedness (including Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, Cash
Management Facility Liabilities, additional senior secured notes, Future Pari Passu Debt, Future Senior Debt
and any future Senior Notes) (“Future Debt”), to the extent such Future Debt cannot be secured with the agreed
ranking without the existing security first being released, the Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions that
such Future Debt will (to the extent permitted by applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of
additional security documents securing the same assets subject to the relevant security on a second- or lesserranking basis and such Future Debt will nonetheless be deemed and treated for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement to be secured by such security pari passu with corresponding liabilities which would otherwise have
the same ranking as contemplated above and any amounts to be applied towards such Future Debt shall be
applied accordingly. In the event that it is not possible to permit the recreation of additional security documents
as referred to above, no amendments or release and retaking of security under the existing security documents
shall be permitted without the consent of the required creditors under the documents thereby secured unless
permitted by such documents.

_Payments and Prepayments; Subordination of any Senior Notes_

The Debtors and the Third Party Security Provider may make payments and prepayments in respect of the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes and the Notes at any time in accordance with their terms and may
prepay or acquire the Notes.

Any Senior Notes Issuer may make payments and prepayments in respect of any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities
(including by prepaying or acquiring any Senior Notes) at any time in accordance with the terms of any Senior
Notes Indenture, any Senior Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement provided that such payment is not made
from assets subject to Transaction Security and not financed by a payment from a member of the Group that was
prohibited at such time by any of the Credit Facility Documents, Senior Secured Notes Documents and Future
Pari Passu Debt Documents.

Prior to the discharge of all Senior Secured Liabilities, no Debtor, Third Party Security Provider or other
member of the Group may make payments in respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities without the consent of the
Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority Senior Secured Creditors except as described in the foregoing
paragraph or as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement including (without limitation and subject to conditions
where applicable) the following:

(1) if:

(a) the payment is of: (i) any of the principal or interest (including capitalized interest) amount of
any Senior Notes Liabilities which is either (1) not prohibited from being paid by the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Cash Management Facility Documents, the Senior
Secured Notes Documents or any Future Pari Passu Debt Document or (2) is paid on or after
the final maturity of any Senior Notes; or (ii) any other amount in respect of any Senior Notes
Liabilities which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest accrued due and payable
in cash in accordance with the terms of any Senior Notes Documents or a corresponding
amount under any Holdco Debt Document;

(b) no notice delivered pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement blocking payments in
respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities (a “Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice”) is
outstanding; and

(c) no Senior Secured Debt Payment Default has occurred and is continuing; or

(2) certain amounts due to any Senior Notes Trustee for its own account; or


-----

(3) payments of amounts equal to any payment accrued pursuant to any Senior Notes or any Senior Notes
guarantee immediately after the period during which any Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice is
outstanding or a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default ceases to be continuing and which would
otherwise have been a permitted payment pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(4) for so long as a Senior Secured Debt Event of Default is continuing certain payments as a result of any
Senior Notes Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged in exchange for the issuance of shares
in any holding company of any Senior Notes Issuer, subject to certain conditions;

(5) certain payments of non-cash interest by way of capitalization;

(6) payments funded with the incurrence of Senior Notes Liabilities;

(7) costs, commissions, taxes, advisory or professional fees, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect
of (or reasonably incidental to) any Senior Notes Documents (including in relation to any reporting or
listing requirements under any Senior Notes Documents), subject to certain conditions;

(8) audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes and other proper and incidental expenses required to maintain
existence or any other reasonable and ordinary course administrative and maintenance costs of a Senior
Notes Issuer or its Affiliates;

(9) costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental
to) any refinancing of any Senior Notes in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving
Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes Documents, the Cash Management Facility Documents and
any Future Pari Passu Debt Document, subject to certain conditions;

(10) payments of certain reasonable and customary consent or amendment/waiver fees in connection with
amendments to any Senior Notes Documents;

(11) payments in connection with purchases, repurchases or redemptions of Senior Notes permitted under
the Credit Facility Documents, Cash Management Facility Documents, Senior Secured Notes
Documents and Future Pari Passu Debt Documents; or

(12) payment of any other amount not exceeding €3,500,000 in aggregate in any twelve month period
(which may be carried forward if not used).

Substantially equivalent provisions and restrictions apply in respect of any Future Senior Debt, _mutatis_
_mutandis._

Prior to the discharge of all the Senior Secured Debt, if a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default has occurred
and is continuing all payments in respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities (other than those consented to by the
Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and certain amounts due to any
Senior Notes Trustee for its own account) will be suspended.

In addition, if a Senior Secured Debt Event of Default (other than a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default)
(each a “Senior Secured Default”) has occurred and is continuing and any Senior Notes Trustee has received a
Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice from either the RCF Agent, the Cash Management Facility Agent or the
Trustee or the representative of the Future Pari Passu Debt (the “Relevant Representative”), all payments in
respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Senior Creditors
and Majority Senior Secured Creditors and certain amounts due to any Senior Notes Trustee for its own
account) are suspended until the earliest of:

(a) the date on which there is a waiver, remedy or cure of such Senior Secured Default in accordance with
the relevant finance documents; or

(b) 179 days after the receipt by any Senior Notes Trustee of the Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice;

(c) the repayment and discharge of all obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities;


-----

(d) the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice
(and, if at such time a Senior Secured Default is continuing in relation to the Senior Secured Liabilities
(other than the Senior Secured Liabilities in respect of which the notice was given), the Relevant
Representative(s) in respect of those other Senior Secured Liabilities) notify/ies (amongst others) any
Senior Notes Trustee that the Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice is cancelled;

(e) the date on which the Security Agent or Senior Notes Trustee takes any Enforcement Action against a
member of the Group which it is permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(f) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Default is no longer continuing and if the relevant Senior
Secured Liabilities have been accelerated such acceleration has been rescinded (and if such
acceleration consisted solely of declaring the relevant debt payable on demand, such rescission can be
effected by the relevant majority creditors in respect of the relevant debt); or

(g) if a Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of a Senior Notes
Payment Stop Notice, the date on which the Standstill Period expires,

provided that none of the circumstances described in this paragraph, nor those described in the paragraph above
shall prevent any Senior Notes Issuer from making payments in respect of any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities in
accordance with the terms of the relevant documentation from its own assets (excluding at all times any assets
which are subject to Transaction Security) provided that such payment is not financed by a payment to any
Senior Notes Issuer from a member of the Group that was prohibited by then existing (if any) Credit Facility
Documents the Senior Secured Notes Documents and Future Pari Passu Debt Documents.

Unless waived by any Senior Notes Trustee, (a) no new Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be served by a
Relevant Representative unless 360 days have elapsed since the immediately prior Senior Notes Payment Stop
Notice and (b) no Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Secured Debt Event
of Default more than 60 days after the date that the Relevant Representative received notice of that Senior
Secured Default. No Relevant Representative may serve more than one Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice with
respect to the same event or set of circumstances, and no Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be served in
respect of a Senior Secured Event of Default notified to a Relevant Representative at the time at which an earlier
Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice was issued.

If a Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding or the relevant Senior Secured Debt Payment
Default has ceased to be continuing (by being waived by the Relevant Representative or remedied) the relevant
Debtor may then make those payments it would have otherwise been entitled to pay under any Senior Notes and
if it does so promptly any event of default under any Senior Notes caused by such delayed payment shall be
waived and any enforcement notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be
waived. A Senior Secured Debt Payment Default is remedied by the payment of all amounts then due.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by any Senior Notes; Senior Notes Standstill_

Without prejudice to the rights of the Senior Creditors to take Enforcement Action in relation to any Senior
Notes Issuer Liabilities and/or any Senior Notes Only Security, prior to the discharge of all the Senior Secured
Liabilities, neither any Senior Notes Trustee nor the holders of any Senior Notes may take Enforcement Action
with respect to any Senior Notes (including any action against any Senior Notes Issuer or the guarantors of any
Senior Notes (if any)) or direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any
relevant Transaction Security document (including the Shared Security) without the prior consent of or as
required by an Instructing Group (as defined below), except that such restriction will not apply in relation to any
Senior Notes Guarantee Liabilities and Shared Security if (1) an event of default has occurred under any Senior
Notes resulting from failure to pay principal at final maturity or (2):

(a) an event of default under any Senior Notes Indenture is continuing;

(b) the RCF Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities have received notice of
the specified event of default from any Senior Notes Trustee;

(c) a Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

(d) the relevant event of default is continuing at the end of the Standstill Period.


-----

A “Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that any Senior Notes Trustee serves an
enforcement notice on the RCF Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities until the
earliest of:

(a) 179 days after such date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes Enforcement Action (including the enforcement of any
Transaction Security permitted to be enforced under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement),
provided that any Senior Notes Trustee and holders of Senior Notes may only take the same
Enforcement Action against the same entity as is taken by the Senior Secured Creditors and may not
take any other action against any other member of the Group;

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of any guarantor of any Senior Notes against
whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and

(d) the expiration of any other Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the current
Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or permitted remedy thereof).

If an Event of Default ceases to be continuing then (provided the relevant parties are made aware of such fact)
any relevant enforcement process (including any requirement of consultation relating to enforcement) relying
solely on that Event of Default shall cease to continue.

Substantially similar provisions to those described in this section with respect to any Senior Notes are included
in the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to Future Senior Debt and related Future Senior Creditors.

If the Security Agent has notified any Senior Notes Trustee that it is enforcing Transaction Security, no other
Senior Notes Creditor may take any enforcement action against the Third Party Security Provider, that Debtor or
any subsidiary of that Debtor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Transaction Security where
such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be
derived therefrom. If any Senior Notes Creditors are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to
require the enforcement of such Transaction Security, such Enforcement Action must require the realization of
the relevant Security by way of a sale or disposal conducted in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Consultation_

Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction
Security and/or the requesting of a distressed disposal and/or the release or disposal of claims and/or
Transaction Security on a distressed disposal (“Enforcement”), the relevant representative of the Super Senior
Liabilities or the Senior Secured Liabilities (as applicable) shall notify the Security Agent and the creditor
representatives for each of the Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors that the
applicable Transaction Security has become enforceable. As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such
a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit instructions with respect to the enforcement of the Transaction
Security or the taking of any other Enforcement Action by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees
promptly upon receipt, following which, the RCF Agent (acting on the instructions of the Super Majority Super
Senior Creditors), the Cash Management Facility Agent, the representative of any Future Pari Passu Creditors
and the Trustee will consult in good faith with each other and the Security Agent for a period of 15 days from
the date such notice is received by such persons (or such shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) with a
view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy
(the “Consultation Period”).

No such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of the
Consultation Period), in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security Enforcement Principles
set forth below (“Qualifying Instructions”) where:

(a) any of the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting any
Senior Notes Issuer, the Issuer, Multiversity or a borrower or a guarantor or any member (or members)
of the Group that is or are a Significant Subsidiary or a Significant Group (each a “Relevant
**Company”); or**


-----

(b) subject to no instructions having been given by an Instructing Group in the circumstances described
below, the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine
in good faith (and notify each other representative agent of the Super Senior Creditors, each Cash
Management Facility, the Senior Secured Creditors, the Future Pari Passu Creditors and the Security
Agent) that any delay caused by such consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount
likely to be realized to a level such that (following application thereof in accordance with the Payment
Waterfall described below) the Super Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full and in this case
any instructions will be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior
Secured Creditors or, as the case may be, the Super Senior Creditors, on behalf of which the relevant
Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first
received.

If following the Consultation Period, the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement
the same.

Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes the failure to
give instructions is deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received by the end of the Consultation Period,
the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
and/ or take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors, in each case provided such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of
all instructions received by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be
deemed revoked.

If the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably)
consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the security in a manner which is not consistent with the Security
Enforcement Principles, subject to (a) and (b) above, the relevant representative shall give notice to the other
representatives after which each such representative shall consult with the Security Agent for a period of 10
days (or such lesser period as the relevant representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of
Enforcement, provided that such representatives shall not be obliged to consult more than once in relation to
each Enforcement Action.

For the purposes of Enforcement, an “Instructing Group” means if prior to the Credit Facility Lender
Discharge Date, the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided
that if:

(a) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been repaid in full within six months of the end of the
Consultation Period (or within six months of the delivery of a specified notice by the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors, where no consultation period is required);

(b) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other
Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period (or within three months
of the delivery of a specified notice by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, where no consultation
period is required); or

(c) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not
commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with
respect to such Relevant Company,

then the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by the
Super Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions) to
the exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting with
any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) and the Instructing Group
in relation to such Enforcement shall mean the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors. Subject to the
foregoing, in the event of Conflicting Enforcement Instructions, the “Instructing Group” shall mean
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors provided that such instructions from the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors are Qualifying Instructions, it being acknowledged that, subject to the other
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the timeframe for the realization of value from the
enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal pursuant to such instructions will be
determined by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors.


-----

Prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date: (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent
not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Shared Security; or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing
Group in relation to the Shared Security, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any
instructions to enforce the Shared Security which the Majority Senior Creditors are then entitled to give to the
Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, as described under the heading “—Restrictions
_on Enforcement by any Senior Notes; Senior Notes Standstill.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time any_
Senior Creditor or its Creditor Representative is then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce
the Shared Security and the Majority Senior Creditors do not give such instruction and do not indicate any
intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce the Shared Security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given by the
Senior Creditors or its Creditor Representative under this Agreement and Security Agent shall act on such
instructions received from the Instructing Group.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of any Senior Notes Only
Security where the Security Agent will act in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Creditors.

_Security Enforcement Principles_

Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Cash
Management Facility Creditors, the Senior Secured Notes Required Holders (as defined below) (if prior to the
Senior Secured Notes Discharge Date), the Future Pari Passu Debt Required Holders (as defined below) and
Multiversity, enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in accordance with the “Security
**Enforcement Principles,” which are summarized as follows:**

(a) It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize,
so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from Enforcement of the
Transaction Security, the recovery by the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Notes Creditors
and the Future Pari Passu Creditors (the “Security Enforcement Objective”).

(b) The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that
either (i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all
cash) for distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or (ii) if Enforcement is at the
direction of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Senior Creditors, sufficient proceeds
from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are
applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and
discharged in full (unless the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(c) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject to the
other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the
Enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal (as defined below) pursuant to
Enforcement will be determined by the Instructing Group provided that it is consistent with the
Security Enforcement Objective.

(d) On (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a
member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5,000,000 (or its
equivalent); or (ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the
shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent shall
(unless such enforcement is made pursuant to a public auction or process supervised by a court of law
which makes a determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized
investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party professional firm that is
regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those
charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert (A)
on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement
Principles and maximize recovery of any such Enforcement Action, (B) that the proceeds received
from enforcement is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant
circumstances, and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement
Objective.


-----

(e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of
a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement. The liability of
any Financial Advisor in respect of the opinions referred to in paragraph (d) above may be limited to
the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

(f) The Financial Advisor’s opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation
to any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of
view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security
Enforcement Objective has been met.

(g) In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares referred to in
(d)(i) above and such Enforcement is conducted by way of public auction, any equity investors of the
Group shall be entitled to participate in such auction. There is no requirement in the Security
Enforcement Principles that requires the Enforcement of Transaction Security to take place by way of
public auction.

(h) In the absence of written notice from a creditor or group of creditors that are not part of the relevant
Instructing Group that such creditor(s) object to any Enforcement of the Transaction Security on the
grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an
“Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction
Security is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(i) If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent
to rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance with this Agreement), a
Financial Advisor’s opinion to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed
at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the requirement of
paragraph (a) above has been met.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of any Senior Notes Only
Security.

_Turnover_

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if any Super Senior Creditor, Cash Management Facility
Creditor, Senior Secured Notes Creditor, Senior Creditor and Future Pari Passu Creditor receives or recovers the
proceeds of any Enforcement of Transaction Security (whether before or after an insolvency event) or any
Senior Notes Only Security other than in accordance with Payments Waterfall that it shall (subject to certain
prior actual knowledge qualifications in the case of the Trustee and any Senior Notes Trustee, as applicable):

- in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold an amount of
that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities of that creditor (or, if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount or an amount equal to that
amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery
exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

- in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

Certain further turnover obligations following receipt of non-permitted payments apply to Senior Notes
Creditors, Future Senior Creditors and Subordinated Creditors.

_Application of Proceeds/Waterfall_

All amounts received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization or Enforcement of
all or any part of the Transaction Security (and, in relation to the Senior Creditors, Shared Security) or otherwise
paid to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement for application in accordance with the
Payments Waterfall (the “Enforcement Proceeds”), other than with respect to any Senior Notes Only Security,


-----

will be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the following payments waterfall in each
case to the extent that security has been given in favor of such obligations (the “Payments Waterfall”):

by such Creditor Representative under any Transaction Security Document or the Intercreditor
Agreement;

- _second, pari passu and pro rata, in or towards payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Super_

Management Facility Creditors, the Trustee on behalf of the Senior Secured Noteholders and to the
relevant Creditor Representative on behalf of the Future Pari Passu Creditors for application towards
any unpaid costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of any Cash Management Facility Creditors,

- _sixth, and only to the extent that the Senior Creditors are entitled to the relevant recoveries, pari passu_
and _pro rata,_ in or towards payment to any Senior Notes Trustee on behalf of the holders of Senior
Notes and to the relevant Creditor Representative on behalf of the Future Senior Creditors for
application towards any unpaid costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the holders of Senior
Notes and any Future Senior Creditors in connection with any realization or enforcement of the Shared
Security taken in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;

- _seventh, and only to the extent that the Senior Creditors are entitled to the relevant recoveries,_ _pari_

Transaction Security if the relevant Cash Management Facility is designated by the Issuer as a “Credit Facility” and therefore
rank as per the prior bullet point above.


-----

application towards the discharge of the Future Senior Debt (in accordance with the relevant
documents); and

- _eighth, after the Final Discharge Date, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Debtor, Third_
Party Security Provider or other person entitled to it.

For the avoidance of doubt (other than as provided above) payments of Enforcement Proceeds may only be

Credit Facility to the lenders thereunder, ancillary lenders and issuing bank and to the Priority Hedge
Counterparties in respect of the Priority Hedging Liabilities and the other payments referred to under “thirdly”
above have been paid in full.

All amounts received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization or Enforcement of
all or any part of any Senior Notes Only Security will be applied in accordance with a separate payments
waterfall as follows:

- _first, in payment of the following amounts in the following order (i) pari passu and pro rata any sums_
owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any of its delegates and any Trustee Liabilities, as the case
may be, and then (ii) _pari passu_ and _pro rata_ to each Creditor Representative of the holders of any

_Acceleration_

If an event of default occurs under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes or Future Pari Passu Debt
then any decision to accelerate the Revolving Credit Facility or Existing Notes or Future Pari Passu Debt and,
subject as provided below, to take any other Enforcement Action will be determined in accordance with the
provisions of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Indenture (or other relevant Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) or in accordance with the terms of the Future Pari Passu Debt (as applicable). The Intercreditor
Agreement contains provisions requiring relevant Creditor Representative to notify the Security Agent of such
event and the Security Agent shall, upon receiving that notification, notify each other party to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Release and/or Transfer of Claims and Liabilities in Respect of any Senior Notes and the Notes and the_**
**_Transaction Security_**

_Non-distressed Disposal_

In circumstances where a disposal or other transaction whereby a release, consent or other step in relation to,
Transaction Security is considered necessary or desirable by Multiversity in connection with such transaction
(including to reflect the Agreed Security Principles) (a “Non-Distressed Disposal”), provided that such NonDistressed Disposal is not being effected at the request of the Instructing Group in circumstances where the


-----

Transaction Security has become enforceable, by enforcement of the Transaction Security or after the
occurrence of a Distress Event (as defined below) (a “Distressed Disposal”) and is otherwise permitted by the
terms of any Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any Senior Notes Indenture, the Credit Facility Documents, the
Cash Management Facility Documents, the Future Pari Passu Debt Documents and the Future Senior Debt
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that (subject to certain conditions) the Security Agent is
authorized (i) to release relevant the Transaction Security or any other relevant claim (relating to a Debt
Document) over any relevant asset; (ii) where any relevant asset consists of all the shares in the capital of a
Debtor, to release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over the assets of
that Debtor and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries; (iii) to execute and deliver or enter into any
release of the Transaction Security or any claim described in (i) and/or (ii) above and/or issue any certificates of
non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing, or return any physical collateral or other

Secured Parties in connection with the same that is not prohibited under the relevant Debt Documents provided
that, to the extent that replacement Transaction Security is required from the transferee under the terms of the
Debt Documents, such Transaction Security shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, be granted at the same time as (or before) the relevant disposal is affected.

_Distressed Disposal_

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security
Agent is authorized and instructed:

(i) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter
into any release of that Transaction Security, or claim and issue any letters of non- crystallization of
any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release (a) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of: (x) the liabilities it may have as a principal

equivalent capacity under the Future Pari Passu Debt Documents and/or Future Senior Debt
Documents) (the “Borrowing Liabilities”); (y) the liabilities under the Debt Documents (present or

treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of those Liabilities
owed to the Primary Creditors or Debtor Liabilities provided that notwithstanding any other provision
of any Debt Document, the transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for
the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if the Security Agent does intend that any

Holdco Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the receiving entity or receiving entities to which
the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities, Holdco Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities are to
be transferred.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Senior Liabilities and Shared Security will be released, it
is a further condition to the release that either:

(i) any Senior Notes Trustee has approved the release on the instructions of any Senior Notes Required
Holders (as defined below) and any Future Senior Debt Representative has approved the release on the
instructions of the Future Senior Debt Required Holders (as defined below); or

(ii) each of the following conditions is satisfied:

pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or
disposed of concurrently with such sale (and such obligations are not assumed by the
purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Security under the Security Documents in respect of
the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released
concurrently with such sale; and

(C) such sale or disposal is made:

(I) pursuant to Competitive Process (being a public or private auction or other
competitive sale process in which more than one bidder participates or is invited to
participate (including any person invited that is a Primary Creditor, which may or
may not be conducted through court or other legal proceedings, and which is
conducted with the advice of a Financial Advisor) in which the Senior Creditors (or a
representative acting on their behalf) shall be entitled to participate as bidder or
financier to the potential purchaser and shall be provided equal information rights as
any other bidder, subject to applicable securities law (and for the avoidance of doubt


-----

in which the Senior Secured Creditors, the Super Senior Creditors or, in each case, a
representative acting on their behalf are also entitled to participate);

(II) pursuant to any process or proceedings approved or supervised by or on behalf of any
court of law which has jurisdiction and where there is a determination of value by or
on behalf of such court; or

(III) where a Financial Advisor has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal
that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view
taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement
and the circumstances giving rise to such sale, provided that the liability of Financial
Advisor in giving such opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of
such engagement.

If prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the
Majority Senior Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, instructions, the Security Agent is not authorized
to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or Holding Company that is a member of the Group from any Borrowing
Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Super Senior
Creditor unless those Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities and any other Senior
Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent Liability relating to a Letter
of Credit, Cash Management Facility LC, a Cash Management Facility or an Ancillary Facility, made the
subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor), following that release.

_Application of Proceeds of a Distressed Disposal_

The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities) shall be paid to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Application of
_Proceeds/Waterfall” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and,_
to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if the disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

_Voting and Amendments_

Voting in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes, the Existing Notes and/or other Future Pari Passu
Debt will be in accordance with the relevant documents.

Except for amendments of a minor, technical or administrative nature which may be effected by the Security
Agent and Multiversity and subject to the paragraph below and certain customary exceptions contained in the
Intercreditor Agreement, amendments to or waivers and consents under the Intercreditor Agreement requires the

(f) the Future Senior Debt Required Holders (as defined below) (if prior to the Future Senior Debt
Discharge Date);

(g) the Security Agent; and

(h) Multiversity,


-----

_provided that to the extent an amendment, waiver or consent only affects certain classes of Creditors, and such_
amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the interests
of the other classes of Creditors, only written agreement from the representative for each affected class (if
applicable, acting on the instructions of the affected class as required) shall be required. Notwithstanding the
paragraph immediately above, subject to certain exceptions, including in relation to the implementation of
certain future indebtedness as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement, an amendment or waiver relating to
provisions dealing with (i) the definition of “Instructing Group,” (ii) ranking and priority, (iii) turnover of
receipts, (iv) redistribution, (v) enforcement of Transaction Security, (vi) proceeds of disposals, (vii) application
of proceeds, (viii) consents, amendments and overrides, and (ix) certain provisions relating to the instructions to
and exercise of discretion by the Security Agent or (x) the order of priority or subordination under the
Intercreditor Agreement, shall not be made without the written consent of:

(a) each Creditor Representative acting in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Debt
Documents;

(b) the Cash Management Facility Lenders (or relevant Cash Management Facility Agent on their behalf, if
appointed) (to the extent that the amendment or waiver (i) would materially adversely affect the rights
and obligations of the Cash Management Facility Lenders under the Intercreditor Agreement in their
capacity as such and (ii) would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other
Creditor or class of Creditors, in each case other than the Cash Management Facility Lenders (solely in
their capacity as such));

(c) each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent that the amendment or waiver (i) would materially adversely
affect the rights and obligations of the Hedge Counterparties in their capacity as such and (ii) would not
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other Creditor or class of Creditors, in each
case other than the Hedge Counterparties (solely in their capacity as such)); and

(d) Multiversity.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that:

(a) “Future Pari Passu Debt Required Holders” means, in respect of any direction, approval, consent or
waiver, the Future Pari Passu Creditors holding in aggregate a principal amount of Future Pari Passu
Debt which is not less than the principal amount of Future Pari Passu Debt required to vote in favor of
such direction, consent or waiver under the terms of the Future Pari Passu Debt Document or, if the
required amount is not specified, the holders holding the majority of the principal amount of the then
outstanding Future Pari Passu Debt in accordance with the relevant Future Pari Passu Debt Documents;

(b) “Future Senior Debt Required Holders” means, in respect of any direction, approval, consent or
waiver, the Future Senior Creditors holding in aggregate a principal amount of Future Senior Debt

direction, consent or waiver under the terms of the Future Senior Debt Document or, if the required
amount is not specified, the holders holding the majority of the principal amount of the then
outstanding Future Senior Debt in accordance with the relevant Future Senior Debt Documents;

(c) “Senior Notes Required Holders” means, in respect of any direction, approval, consent or waiver, the
holders of any Senior Notes holding in aggregate a principal amount of Senior Notes which is not less
than the principal amount of Senior Notes required to vote in favor of such direction, consent or waiver
under the terms of any Senior Notes Documents or, if the required amount is not specified, the holders
holding the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes (as applicable) in
accordance with the applicable Senior Notes Documents; and

(d) “Senior Secured Notes Required Holders” means, in respect of any direction, approval, consent or
waiver, the holders of any Senior Secured Notes holding in aggregate a principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes which is not less than the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes required to vote in
favor of such direction, consent or waiver under the terms of the applicable Senior Secured Notes
Documents or, if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding the majority of the principal
amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes (as applicable) in accordance with the applicable
Senior Secured Notes Documents.


-----

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action or to
provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement (and any other Debt
Document, which does not contain a substantially equivalent snooze/ lose provision) any creditor fails to
respond to the request within seven Business Days (or any other period of time notified by the Company, with
the agreement of the Security Agent in the case of a shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit
participation, such creditor will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter
or be deemed to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, such provision shall not apply to any holder of a Note in respect of any request
where such holder of a Note is not given the option to respond to such request in the negative but shall otherwise
apply to all holders of a Note.

_Option to Purchase_

Following:

(a) any notice that the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or

(b) either (i) a prescribed acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility, a Cash Management Facility
Document, the Notes, the Existing Notes, the Future Pari Passu Debt, any Senior Notes or the Future
Senior Debt, or (ii) the enforcement of any Transaction Security (a “Distress Event”),

the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Cash Management Facilities Lenders and the Future Pari Passu
Creditors shall have an option to purchase all (but not part) of the commitments of the lenders (or their affiliates)
under the Revolving Credit Facility and all the exposures in respect of any Priority Hedging Agreements at par
plus accrued interest and all other amounts owing under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and the
Priority Hedging Agreements, with such purchase to occur all at the same time.

Following (a) any notice that the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or (b) a Distress Event, the
holders of any Senior Notes and the Future Senior Debt Creditors shall have an option to purchase all (but not
part) of the Senior Secured Debt at par plus accrued interest and all other amounts owing in respect of such
Senior Secured Debt, with such purchase to occur all at the same time.

_Hedging_

All scheduled payments (or another ordinary course payment, including in relation to fees, costs and expenses)
or Adjustment Payments (as such term is defined in the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement as published by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. on September 19, 2018) or equivalent payment permitted
under a Hedging Agreement (other than certain close out payments whilst a Senior Secured Default is
continuing (or payments when a scheduled payment from the hedging counterparty is due and unpaid)) are
permitted payments for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions in relation to the circumstances in which a Priority
Hedge Counterparty and a Non-Priority Hedge Counterparty may take Enforcement Action in relation to its
hedging.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

On, following or in contemplation of an initial public offering of a member of the Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO”), Multiversity is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will
automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to
the entity who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown
**Entity”), and its respective Restricted Subsidiaries, provided that if any Senior Notes (or debt ranking** _pari_
_passu therewith) are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be_
the Senior Notes Issuer (or other pari passu debt issuer) for the purposes of the Senior Liabilities (if applicable)
and the direct subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer for the purposes of the Group, all other Liabilities and all
related provisions, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO
Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii)


-----

certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will
cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security, including Shared Security), and
each Subordinated Creditor or Senior Notes Issuer will be released from its obligations and restrictions under
the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the requisite majority lenders under each applicable class of debt (being the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Senior Creditors, Multiversity
and each other member of the Group and each Third Party Security Provider shall also be released from all
obligations as Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the
Transaction Security (other than, in each case, Borrowing Liabilities)). Each party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (other than a member of the Group) shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or
replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate the matters described in each of the above paragraphs
under the heading “—Provisions Following an IPO.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Senior Notes and any Future Senior Debt are not refinanced in full on
or before the date of such IPO, for the purposes of the Group or Senior Liabilities, the IPO Pushdown Entity
shall be any holding company of Multiversity which is the issuer or borrower of any Senior Liabilities and, for
the purposes of the Group or Liabilities other than the Senior Liabilities (and all related provisions), the IPO
Pushdown Entity shall be the direct subsidiary thereof and (ii) if the Senior Notes and any Future Senior Debt
have been refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO Event but the Senior Secured Notes and any
Future Pari Passu Debt have not been refinanced in full on or before then, Multiversity shall be the IPO
Pushdown Entity and the Group (and all related provisions) shall continue to comprise Multiversity and each of
its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time.

_Debt Transfer_

Provided certain conditions are met, Multiversity may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of
any Creditor in respect of all or part of any Liabilities owing by a Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Credit Facility
Borrower (a “Debt Transfer Borrower”) in respect of its Liabilities (including borrowing liabilities) under the
applicable Debt Documents be novated or otherwise transferred by that Debt Transfer Borrower (a “Debt
**Transfer”). Any Debt Transfer may be effected on a cashless basis, by way of book entries and not as physical**
cash movement to repay and re-borrow any applicable Liabilities.

_General_

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions dealing with:

(a) close-out rights for the Priority Hedge Counterparties and the Non-Priority Hedge Counterparties;

(b) permitted payments (including without limitation, the repayment of Shareholder Liabilities and the
payment of permitted distributions in each case to the extent permitted under the terms of the relevant
documents relating to the Senior Secured Debt, any Senior Notes and the Future Senior Debt);

(c) incurrence of Future Pari Passu Debt or Future Senior Debt that will allow certain creditors and agents
with respect to such Future Pari Passu Debt or Future Senior Debt, as the case may be, to accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement and benefit from, and be subject to, the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement so long as not prohibited under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing
Indenture or the Indenture and Future Senior Debt shall be subject to the same subordination provisions
as any Senior Notes;

(d) the ability to replace or supplement the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with facilities benefiting
from a similar position under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;

(e) payments received by creditors which are not permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement shall be
required to be held on trust for the Security Agent and provided to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the Payments Waterfall; and


-----

(f) customary protections for the Security Agent (and its receivers and delegates), any Senior Notes
Trustee and the Trustee.

_Governing law_

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with English law.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading
“Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Issuer,” “we,” “our,”
and “us” refer only to Pachelbel BidCo S.p.A or any Successor Company or other Person that assumes all
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, in each case, in accordance with the Indenture.

The Issuer will issue €550 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2031
(the “Floating Rate **Notes”) and €550 million aggregate principal amount of      % Senior Secured Notes due**
2031 (the “Fixed Rate Notes” and together with the Floating Rate Notes, the “Notes”) under an indenture to be
dated as of       , 2024 (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer, BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee
Services Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the
“Security Agent”), agent (mandatario con rappresentanza) and Security Representative (as defined below), and
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent. The Indenture will not incorporate or include,
or be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The offering of the Notes is expected to close prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. Pending
consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering on
the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into a separate Escrow Account in the name of the
Issuer but controlled by the Escrow Agent, and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes. The release of the Escrowed Property will be subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions as set forth herein. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory
Redemption (as defined herein). The Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined herein) of each series of
Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate initial issue price of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest, and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding the special mandatory redemption
date. See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In the event that the consummation of the
Acquisition is expected to occur on or about, and in any event, within three Business Days of, the Issue Date,
the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes may be directly utilized by the Issuer to, inter alia, complete the
Acquisition as described in the section “Use of Proceeds” without being subject to the escrow arrangements
described in this Offering Memorandum. In which case, the escrow-related mechanics (but not the special
mandatory redemption provisions) described in this Offering Memorandum shall be deemed redundant (except
as otherwise set forth herein). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

On the Acquisition Closing Date, the proceeds of the Offering and the Equity Contribution will be used by the
Issuer to fund the Acquisition and to pay the estimated costs and expenses associated with the Transactions (as
defined under “Summary—The Transactions”) as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use
_of Proceeds.”_

Following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the
Post-Closing Reorganization (as defined herein) as a result of which the Issuer will merge into the Target under
a reverse merger (with the Target being the surviving entity) within 18 months following the Acquisition
Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The Post-Closing Reorganization is subject to certain
conditions, including legal and regulatory approvals and may not be completed. See also “Risks Related to the
_Group’s Capital Structure—We may be unable to complete the Post-Closing Reorganization within the_
_anticipated timeframe, or at all.” Following the Post-Closing Reorganization (if completed), the Target is_
expected to assume the rights and obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €550 million aggregate principal
amount of Floating Rate Notes and €550 million aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes will be issued
in this offering. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes (the
“Additional Notes”). We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants
contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). Except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture,
each of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes will constitute a separate series of Notes but will be
treated, together with any Additional Notes and any other series of Notes, as a single class for all purposes under
the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes”
include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually issued.


-----

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the
terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes. Please see “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor_
Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the
Indenture. It does not, however, restate the Notes and the Indenture in their entirety and where reference is made
to a particular provision of the Notes or the Indenture, such reference, including the definitions of certain terms,
is qualified in its entirety by reference to all of the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, Intercreditor
Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the Escrow Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions
of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions.

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the
“Exchange”) and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. There is no assurance that the Notes will
be, or will remain, listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. In the event that the Notes are
admitted to trading on an exchange other than the Exchange, references herein to the Exchange shall be deemed
to be to the relevant exchange upon which the Notes are listed.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security;”

- rank _pari passu_ in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of the Issuer and other
obligations that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- rank effectively senior to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not secured on the
Collateral to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are secured by
property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such obligations; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
are not Guarantors, including prior to the earlier of the implementation of the Post-Closing
Reorganization or the Guarantee of the Notes by the Target (the “Upstream Guarantee”), any existing
or future obligations of the Target under the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. Our
ability to provide the Upstream Guarantee is subject to certain material legal and contractual limitations
(including the completion of the Whitewash Procedure), which may limit the value of such Guarantee
or result in us not being able to provide it at all as described under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Collateral, the Upstream Guarantee and_
_any future guarantees or security of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and_
_may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_
_enforceability.” and_ “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_


-----

The Issuer is a newly incorporated holding company, with no material operations of its own and only limited
assets, other than its interest in the issued and outstanding shares of its subsidiaries and outstanding
indebtedness and intercompany balances incurred in connection with the Acquisition and the other transactions
described in this Offering Memorandum. All of the operations of the Issuer are conducted by its Subsidiaries
and, therefore, the Issuer will depend on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its respective obligations,
including the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes. The Issuer’s subsidiaries may be restricted from providing
funds to the Issuer under certain circumstances, including pursuant to restrictions under applicable law and
contractual restrictions, including prior to the Post-Closing Reorganization, under the Existing Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes
_Guarantees—The Issuer will be dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to make_
_payments on the Notes.”_

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will not control the Target Group, and the Target Group will
not be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that,
prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have
been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date and
any such non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date.

Following the Acquisition Closing Date, it is expected that the primary operations of the Issuer will be
conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors,
secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred
and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets
and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders of the Notes. The
Notes therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and
minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors.

As of December 31, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (as defined under “Summary—The
_Transactions”), the principal amount of our senior secured indebtedness would have been €1,865.0 million. In_
addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to €200.0 million. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Although the
Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not
impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue €1,100 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes on the Issue Date, consisting of
€550 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes and €550 million aggregate principal amount of
Fixed Rate Notes. Both series of Notes will mature on     , 2031. The Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**_Interest_**

_Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes_

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue on the outstanding principal amount at the rate of % per
annum and will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrear on and of each year, commencing on
, 2025 to Holders of record in respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding as at the Clearing
System Business Day immediately preceding the payment date, as the case may be.

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months on the aggregate nominal amount outstanding. Each interest period for the Fixed Rate Notes shall
commence on and include an interest payment date and end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment
date, with the exception that the first interest period shall commence on and include the date of the original
issuance of the Fixed Rate Notes.


-----

_Interest on the Floating Rate Notes_

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly,
equal to the sum of

(i) three-month EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero) plus

(ii) % per annum, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”), who shall
initially be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will:

    - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most
recently paid;

    - be payable in cash quarterly in arrear on    ,    ,     and    , commencing on    ,
2024;

    - be payable to the holder of record of such Floating Rate Notes on the Clearing System
Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and

    - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of
interest on the Floating Rate Notes.

“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR01 as of 11:00 A.M. (Brussels time), on the
Determination Date; provided that, EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does
not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London or
Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to
provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 A.M.
(Brussels time), on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a
Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, EURIBOR for the
Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so
provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London or Frankfurt, as selected by the Issuer, to
provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 A.M., London time,
on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a
three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If
at least two such rates are so provided, EURIBOR for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such
rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then EURIBOR for the Interest Period will be EURIBOR in
effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

If the Issuer determines, prior to any Determination Date, that:

(1) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR;

(2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently;

(3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR;

(4) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital
markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or

(5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to
calculate any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR,


-----

a Rate Determination Agent, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall select with the
prior consent of the Issuer a successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that
has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group
thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that is expected to develop or has developed
as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Floating Rate Notes in the
European leveraged finance market or which has been adopted in other debt market instruments such as or
comparable to the Floating Rate Notes which have been issued by a company owned by the Sponsor in the
European leveraged finance market (with no applicable adjustment spread) for use in calculating the Applicable
Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the
Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least three Business Days prior to any Determination
Date, such Successor Rate (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and Paying Agent shall be
entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any
kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall
be bound by any such Successor Rate without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee. For
the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the Successor Rate shall, in all cases, not be less than 0%. The Issuer shall
promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate. Following the adoption of any Successor
Rate, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate.

“euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period,” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the
first Interest Period shall commence on and include from the date of the original issuance of the Notes.

“Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an
independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed by the
Issuer at the expense of the Issuer, or, (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to
under (a), the Issuer.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a
single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page EURIBOR01” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may
replace that page on that service, or, if no such page is available, such other page as may replace that page on
such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“T2” means the real time gross settlement system operated by the Eurosystem, or any successor system.

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the T2 is open for the settlement of payments in euro.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 A.M. (Brussels time) on each Determination
Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Floating Rate
Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be
calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes outstanding at the
commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the
Interest Period concerned divided by 360, provided that interest shall only be paid in respect of Floating Rate
Notes outstanding on the applicable interest payment dates. All percentages resulting from any of the above
calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five
one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to
4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation
Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In
no event will the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate
of interest on the Floating Rate Notes is permitted under any applicable law.

_General_

The Issuer shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on
overdue principal at a rate that is 1% higher than the then-applicable interest rate on the applicable series of
Notes to the extent lawful; it will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any


-----

Bankruptcy Law) on overdue instalments of interest, if any (without regard to any applicable grace period), at
the same rate to the extent lawful.

If the due date for any payment in respect of the Notes is not a Business Day or a business day at the place at
which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until
the next succeeding business day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment
as a result of any such delay. The rights of Holders in beneficial interest of the Notes to receive the payments on
such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Notes will initially be held in book-_
_entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights_
_and remediesThe Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures_
of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.”

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be
payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with
respect to the Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by a nominee of
a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**
for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by bank transfer to the
person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent,
_Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes.”_

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be The Bank of
New York Mellon, London Branch (the “Principal Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar and Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch. The
Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and
will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice to
the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the
rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any change of Paying
Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is
expected to be the _Luxemburger Wort). Such notice of the change in a Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer_
Agent may also be published on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com), to
the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. In addition, for so long
as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, such notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on
behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent
or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under the headings “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer is_
permitted to issue additional Notes (“Additional Notes”), which shall have the terms set out in an Officer’s
Certificate supplied to the Trustee. Each of the Floating Rate Notes and Fixed Rate Notes will constitute
separate series of Notes, but will be treated, along with any Additional Notes and any other series of Notes, as a
single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which
are not specifically distinguished for such series. In the Issuer’s sole discretion, the aforementioned Officer’s
Certificate may include, among others, provisions pertaining to (a) the redemption of such Additional Notes, in
whole or in part, including, but not limited to, pursuant to any special mandatory redemption in the event that
the release from any escrow into which proceeds of the issuance of such Additional Notes are deposited is


-----

conditioned on the consummation of any acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction (such
redemption, an “Additional Notes Special Mandatory Redemption”), (b) the escrow of all or a portion of the
proceeds of such Additional Notes and the granting of Liens described in clause (y) of the definition of
“Permitted Liens” in favor of the Trustee or a security agent for the benefit of the holders of such Additional
Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit of the holders of any other Notes, including Notes of
the same series as such Additional Notes), together with all necessary authorizations for the Trustee or such
security agent to enter into such arrangements; _provided that, for so long as the proceeds of such Additional_
Notes are in escrow, such Additional Notes shall benefit only from such Liens and shall not be subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and shall not benefit from any security
interest in the Collateral and (c) the maturity date, interest rate (which may be fixed or floating), interest
payment dates and related record dates, currency, clearing system and denominations for such Additional Notes,
it being understood that, with respect to the Additional Notes, all references to currency (including any
government obligations related thereto) and denominations herein shall mean the currencies (including any
government obligations related thereto) and denominations applicable to such Additional Notes. In addition,
such Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pursuant to which such Additional Notes are issued bearing a
temporary CUSIP, ISIN or Common Code pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as the
consummation of an acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction, and such Additional Notes
bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or Common Code may be automatically exchanged for new Additional Notes
bearing the same CUSIP, ISIN or Common Code as any existing Notes issued. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be
deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes.
Additional Notes may also be designated as additional Fixed Rate Notes or additional Floating Rate Notes but
only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to the initial Fixed Rate Notes or the initial
Floating Rate Notes, as applicable. The initial Floating Rate Notes and any additional Floating Rate Notes shall
be deemed to form one series and references to the “Floating Rate Notes” shall be deemed to include the
Floating Rate Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any additional Floating Rate Notes. The initial
Fixed Rate Notes and any additional Fixed Rate Notes shall be deemed to form one series and references to the
“Fixed Rate Notes” shall be deemed to include the Fixed Rate Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as
any additional Fixed Rate Notes (it being understood that any Additional Notes that are substantially identical in
all material respects to any other series of Notes but for being subject to an Additional Notes Special Mandatory
Redemption shall be deemed to be substantially identical to such series of Notes only following the expiration of
any provisions relating to such Additional Notes Special Mandatory Redemption).

**Notes Guarantees**

The Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. Following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Target to guarantee the Notes within 120 days following the
Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles. On or about the Acquisition Closing Date,
the Issuer will guarantee the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

Although there will be no initial Guarantors, if required by the covenant as described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security_
Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility, Public Debt or certain other
indebtedness shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Notes Guarantee will be a joint and several obligation of each Guarantor. Each Notes Guarantee will:

- be a general senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor, secured as set forth under “Security;”

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of the relevant Guarantor
and other obligations that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of the relevant Guarantor that are
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee;

- rank effectively senior to any existing and future obligations of the relevant Guarantor that are not
secured on the Collateral owned by such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the Collateral;


-----

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the relevant Guarantor that are
secured by property or assets that do not secure such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such obligations; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the subsidiaries of the relevant
Guarantor that do not provide Guarantees.

Any Notes Guarantees that are subject to limitations under applicable law will be contractually limited under the
applicable Notes Guarantee to reflect such limitations with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate
benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and
their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. In addition, each Notes Guarantee (if any) will be
limited to the maximum amount that would not render the relevant Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance
under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable
provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with
corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under
its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. For a description of such contractual limitations,
see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.” In particular, our ability to procure the Upstream Guarantee is subject to_
certain material legal and contractual limitations (including the completion of the Whitewash Procedure), which
may limit the value of such Guarantee or result in us not being able to provide it at all as described under “Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Collateral, the Upstream_
_Guarantee and any future guarantees or security of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity_
_and enforceability.”_

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions
on the granting of guarantees and security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other legal or regulatory limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims, works
council or other employee consultation requirements and similar principles.

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will
terminate and be discharged and be of no further force and effect):

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger or other combination) of
the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the
sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor (or a holding company thereof)
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) (a) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors
under the Indenture and the Notes or (b) upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge.”_

(4) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and
discharged from its liability with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) does not guarantee
any other Credit Facility which is a term facility which constitutes Senior Secured Indebtedness or
Junior Lien Indebtedness or Public Debt;

(5) as provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including
in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;”


-----

(7) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Notes Guarantees;”_

(8) as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited by the covenant described below under “—
_Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation,” including upon the liquidation or dissolution of the_
Guarantor in compliance therewith;

(9) in connection with an IPO Debt Pushdown in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

Upon the request of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions, including the
granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to
effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without
the consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as follows:

- Notes of a series sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the
Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for
the accounts of Euroclear and/ or Clearstream.

- Notes of a series sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global
**Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the**
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their
respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the
“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) of the same series denominated in the same currency only upon delivery
by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A BookEntry Interests of the same series only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under
“Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it


-----

will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes
issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined
by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Note as the
owner of it for all purposes.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the
“Global Fixed Rate Notes”) and no Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in
the Global Fixed Rate Notes (the “Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Notes”) may be transferred or exchanged
for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Floating Rate Notes (the “Global Floating
**Rate Notes”) or any Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global**
Floating Rate Notes (the “Definitive Registered Floating Rate Notes”), and no Book-Entry Interest in the
Global Floating Rate Notes and no Definitive Registered Floating Rate Note may be transferred or exchanged
for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Fixed Rate Note or any Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Note.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Acquisition Closing Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries”
for the purposes of the Indenture. Under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—
_“Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries.” Such Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent,
pursuant to which the Initial Purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross
proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will


-----

be pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to an escrow
charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer, the Escrow Agent and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). The
initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions
and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, including interest and amounts payable in relation to the amounts held
in the Escrow Account) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.”

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Release”), the
Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, an
Officer’s Certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall rely, without further
investigation, to the effect that the following conditions have been met or will be satisfied:

- the Acquisition will be consummated substantially on the terms set forth in the Acquisition Agreement,
on or about, and in any event, within three Business Days of, the date of the release of the Escrowed
Property, except for any changes, waivers or other modifications that will not, when taken as whole,
have a material adverse effect on the Holders (taken as a whole); and

- as of the date thereof, there shall not have occurred an Event of Default under clause (5) of the first
paragraph under the heading titled “Events of Default” with respect to the Issuer.

The Release shall occur promptly following receipt of the Officer’s Certificate in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.

Upon the Release, the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall be paid out in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agreement will provide that if an interest payment date on
the Notes occurs prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer may, at its option, elect to make such interest
payment with the Escrowed Property upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee, and the Trustee
will release the amount due for the payment of such interest, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, from the Escrow Charge.

In the event that the consummation of the Acquisition is expected to occur on or about the Issue Date, the gross
proceeds of the Offering may be directly utilized by the Issuer to consummate the Acquisition as described in
the section “Use of Proceeds” without being subject to the escrow arrangements described in this Offering
Memorandum, provided that on or prior to the Issue Date, the conditions described in the second paragraph of
this provision “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” will have been met or will be satisfied.
In which case, the escrow-related mechanics (but not the special mandatory redemption provisions) described in
this Offering Memorandum shall be deemed redundant, except as set forth in the following paragraph.

In the event that, the Acquisition is not consummated within three Business Days following the release of the
gross proceeds of the Offering (or the Escrowed Property, as applicable) to the Issuer, the Issuer shall deposit
(or redeposit) with the Escrow Agent such amount, which shall thereupon be (i) held by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge and subject to the terms therein, (ii) subject
to the Lien of the Escrow Charge and (iii) subject to Release of the Escrowed Property in accordance with
Release provision in the preceding paragraphs.

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (b) the Issuer
notifies the Escrow Agent and the Trustee that in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not
be consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date (c) the Issuer notifies the Escrow Agent and the Trustee that the
Acquisition Agreement has been fully and finally terminated at any time on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date, or (d) an Event of Default arises under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “Events of
_Default” on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date with respect to the Issuer (the date of such event being the_
“Special Termination Date”), the Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the
Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal
to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or if
interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).


-----

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, and will
provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice
is given by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory
**Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying**
Agent for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes and,
concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Issuer.
Under the terms of the Escrow Agreement, amounts may be released from the Escrow Account prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date to pay any negative interest (if any) charged on the Escrow Account by the Escrow
Agent and to pay accrued interest on the Notes on any interest payment date in respect thereof occurring prior to
the Release.

The Escrowed Property will be limited to the gross proceeds from the Offering, together with any earnings
thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest on
each series of Notes that may be payable in the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption. In the event that the
Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes exceeds
the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, Holdco is expected to make an equity contribution to the Issuer
to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the
Escrowed Property pursuant to a commitment provided by it.

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Issuer will grant to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Holders of the Notes a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account pursuant to the
Escrow Charge. Upon receipt by the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate (upon which the Trustee shall be entitled
to rely without liability) for the release the Trustee shall be deemed to consent to the release of the Escrowed
Property from the Escrow Account.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge and, to the extent such provisions relate to the
Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Notes in a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Indenture, may be waived or
modified in any manner materially adverse to the Holders without the consent of Holders of a majority of the
outstanding Notes. By accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by the terms of
the Escrow Agreement and have irrevocably authorized the Trustee and Escrow Agent to take all the actions set
forth in the Escrow Agreement without the need for further direction from them under the Indenture.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the
Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred
and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Escrow Charge. On or about the Acquisition Closing Date,
the Issuer, HoldCo and the Trustee will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes will be secured by (a) on
or about the Acquisition Closing Date, a share pledge granted by Holdco over the entire issued share capital of
the Issuer (the “Issuer Share Pledge”); and (b) within 10 Business Days following the Acquisition Closing
Date, the Issuer shall enter into a deed of confirmation and extension in respect of the Existing Target Share
Pledge over the entire issued share capital of the Target (the Existing Target Share Pledge as so confirmed and
extended being the “Target Share Pledge”). The Issuer Share Pledge and the Target Share Pledge are
collectively referred to as the “Collateral.”

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Existing Notes and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility are
secured by a first-ranking share pledge over the entire issued share capital of the Target (the “Existing Target
**Share Pledge”). In addition, on or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Existing Notes and the Revolving**
Credit Facility will be secured by the Issuer Share Pledge and within 10 Business Days following the
Acquisition Closing Date, the Target Share Pledge. As a result, following the Acquisition Closing Date (and
subject to the accession of the Issuer, Holdco and the Trustee to the Intercreditor Agreement as described
above), the Collateral will secure the liabilities under the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit


-----

Facility on a _pari passu basis, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security_
Principles and the terms of the security documents.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” additional security interests_
may be granted over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, including for the benefit of any Additional Notes issued by the Issuer as permitted under
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees.” Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to_
secure obligations under the Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.”
All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral
Liens.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any_
pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the
Agreed Security Principles. The following is a summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles:

- general legal, regulatory and statutory limitations, financial assistance (including under Article 2358
and/or 2374 of the Italian Civil Code), capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference,
equitable subordination, transfer pricing, “interest stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and
other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “liquidity impairment” rules, thin capitalization
rules, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles
may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a Notes Guarantee or security or may require
that the Notes Guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any such limit applies, the
Notes Guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which the relevant
member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence) and
subject to fiduciary duties of management;

- a key factor in determining whether or not a guarantee or security shall be taken is the applicable time
and cost (including material adverse tax consequences or adverse effects on interest deductibility and
stamp duty, registration taxes, notarisation and registration fees) which shall not be disproportionate to
the benefit to the Holders of the Notes of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- the giving of a Notes Guarantee, the granting and the terms of security or the perfection of the security
granted will not be required to the extent that the Group would incur any legal fees, registration fees,
notarial fees, stamp duty, taxes and any other fees or costs directly associated with such security or
Notes Guarantee which are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the secured parties and/or
having regard to the extent of the obligations which can be guaranteed or secured by that security and
the priority that will be offered by taking or perfecting the security. In particular, it is acknowledged
that the Issuer and/ or Guarantor have agreed not to opt (where possible) for the _Imposta Sostitutiva_
regime pursuant to article 15 and subsequent of Italian Presidential Decree No. 601/1973 as amended
and supplemented from time to time. Accordingly, Italian security that requires payment of an _ad_
_valorem_ registration tax on the amount of the secured obligations will not be taken unless it can be
executed by way of exchange of correspondence or minimised upon execution (including through a cap
on the amount of the secured obligations agreed between the Security Agent and the Issuer, each acting
reasonably). Non-Italian security that requires payment of an ad valorem registration tax on the amount
of the secured obligation will not be taken if tax duty cannot be minimized upon execution (including
through a cap to the secured obligations agreed between the security agent and the Issuer (each acting
reasonably));

- where there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets owned by the
Issuer or any Guarantor in a particular category, the principle stated in the second previous bullet above
shall apply and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, only the material assets in that category shall
be subject to security;

- in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible, impractical or disproportionately costly to grant
Notes Guarantees or create security over certain categories of assets, in which event such Notes
Guarantees will not be granted and security will not be taken over such assets;


-----

- certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another
external body’s or person’s consent may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a
guarantee or security. Such guarantee and/or security shall not be required unless such consent has
been received;

- any assets subject to legal requirements, licenses or any other third-party arrangements (including,
without limitation, any trade receivables) which may prevent those assets from being charged (or assets
which, if charged, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights,
benefits and/or obligations of the Group in respect of those assets or require any member of the Group
to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof) will be
excluded from any relevant Security Document; no security shall be required over (and no consent or
waiver request submitted with respect to) assets which are required to support indebtedness assumed in
connection with an acquisition to the extent permitted by the terms of the Notes Documents to remain
outstanding following a Permitted Acquisition (“Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness”) and no
member of the target group acquired pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition where Assumed Acquisition
Indebtedness remains outstanding following completion of such Permitted Acquisition shall be
required to become a Guarantor or grant security with respect to the Notes Documents if prevented by
the terms of the documentation governing such Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness;

- members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into Security Documents
if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of
the relevant members of the Group or if the same would conflict with the fiduciary duties of those
directors or contravene any legal prohibition, bona fide contractual restriction or any regulatory
condition or prohibition or result in (or in a material risk of) personal or criminal liability on the part of
any Officer or result in any significant risk of legal liability for the directors of any Group company.
Furthermore, members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into
Security Documents if the foregoing may, in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer, have an adverse
impact on the credit rating of any member of the Group or any debt or other instrument issued by a
member of the Group or in respect of which a member of the Group is a trustee, corporate
administrator or similar or analogous function or if the relevant member of the Group is acting as a
trustee or similar or analogous function in a securitisation, structured financing or other similar
arrangement;

- additional guarantee limitation provisions may be included in any supplemental indenture if required
by any Officer of any member of the Group in connection with the granting of a Notes Guarantee in
order to protect that Officer from potential liability or other legal risk;

- the terms of the security should not be such that they materially restrict the running of the business of
or materially adversely affect the tax arrangements of the relevant member of the Group in the ordinary
course as or otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents;

- the security will be first ranking, to the extent possible and subject to any Permitted Liens, and shall be
limited to security over the shares in each Guarantor, _provided_ that the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide that the liabilities in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations
shall effectively rank in priority to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with respect to proceeds from
the enforcement of such security;

- information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if and only to the extent, required by local law and
local market practice to be provided solely to perfect or register the relevant security interests will be
provided annually upon the reasonable request of the Security Agent or, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and notice has been provided in accordance with the terms of the Indenture
such that immediate repayment of the Notes is required (and such notice has not been withdrawn,
cancelled or otherwise ceased to have effect), at the Security Agent’s reasonable request;

- perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as
reasonably practicable. The giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or
the perfection of security interests granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the relevant Issuer or Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the
ordinary course or as otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents (and any requirement under the


-----

Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be
subject to this paragraph);

- any Security Document entered into by a member of the Group shall be governed by the law of and
secure assets located in or otherwise governed or expressed to be governed by the laws of the
jurisdiction of incorporation of that member of the Group, provided that security over shares shall be
governed by the jurisdiction of incorporation of the member of the Group whose shares are the subject
of security;

- access to the assets of the Issuer or a Guarantor and the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may
be restricted or limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes
and duties where the benefit of increasing the Notes Guarantee or secured amount is disproportionate to
the level of such fees, taxes and duties (and in any event the maximum aggregate amount payable by
the Group in respect of fees, costs, expenses, disbursements and non-recoverable value added tax
(“VAT”) relating to the provision of guarantees and security shall be limited to an amount to be agreed
between the security agent and the Issuer and no guarantee or security will be required until such
amount is agreed);

- no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where a member of the Group is not incorporated;

- no perfection action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the
Group;

- the Security Agent will hold one set of security interests for the secured parties to the extent reasonably
practicable taking into account local law considerations;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over, or over the assets of, or loans to, any joint
venture or similar arrangement or any minority interest or from any member of the Group which is not
incorporated or established in a Guarantor Jurisdiction (being Italy);

- no guarantees or security will be required to be given by Wversity or Multiversity S.p.A. or in respect
of the shares or other interests held in such entities (or loans made to such entities) by other members
of the Group. If required to be granted in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, any pledge to
be granted over the shares in Universita Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. shall be granted by Multiversity as
the surviving entity of the Post-Closing Reorganization;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting
security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be
granted over the material assets only;

- each Security Document should contain a clause which records that: (i) if there is a conflict between
the Security Document and the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement then (to the extent permitted by law) the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, shall take priority over the provisions
of the Security Document; (ii) notwithstanding any provision of a Security Document, nothing which is
permitted to be done under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a breach of any term of a Security Document; and (iii) no
representation, warranty, undertaking or other provision contained in a Security Document shall be
breached to the extent it conflicts with (or is more onerous than an equivalent provision in) the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or prohibit or
condition any transaction or matter which would otherwise be permitted under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- no Notes Guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap
_Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;_


-----

- any Security Document shall only be required to be notarized or notarially certified if required by law
in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence or for the document to
bear a “certified date” as a matter of Italian law;

- no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be
required;

- no member of the Group will be required to create security over, or otherwise encumber the shares or
assets of, or any loans to, any Unrestricted Subsidiary or any subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary
and no Unrestricted Subsidiary or any subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be required to
become a Guarantor;

- in the Security Documents, there will be no repetition or extension of clauses set out in the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, such as those relating to
notices, costs and expenses, indemnities, tax gross-up, distribution of proceeds and release of security;
and

- no member of the Group will be required to create security over or otherwise encumber any asset
which is excluded by virtue of the application of the other Agreed Security Principles.

The Agreed Security Principles also set out certain additional factors which will apply when determining the
extent of the guarantees and the security to be provided and certain additional principles which will be reflected
in any security taken.

As described above, the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit
Facility as well as certain Hedging Obligations and may also secure certain future indebtedness; _provided,_
_however, that pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and_
counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations will receive the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral
in priority to the holders of the Notes and any Additional Notes and the Existing Notes. See “—Priority” below.
See also, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—
_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging liabilities and certain debt that we may incur in_
_the future will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in_
_priority to the Notes.” The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the_
obligations owed to the holders of the Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature,
some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly,
the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Notes will be effectively subordinated to_
_additional indebtedness that the Group may incur to the extent such debt is secured by assets that do not also_
_secure the Notes. In addition, the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to_
_satisfy the obligations under the Notes.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative contractual priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created (or
confirmed and/or extended, as the case may be), by the Security Documents (the “Security Interest”) as
between (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging
Obligations, (c) the trustee, security agent and the holder of the Existing Notes under the Existing Notes
Indenture and (d) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture, respectively,
is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which provide, among
other things, that the obligations under the Notes and the Existing Notes will receive proceeds on enforcement
of security over the Collateral only after the claims of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and such
Hedging Obligations and any future Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super priority basis in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement are satisfied. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_


-----

In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after
the Acquisition Closing Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of
_Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and_ “—Certain Definitions—Permitted
_Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted (or confirmed and/or extended, as the case may be) over
the Collateral to secure, inter alia, the payment when due of the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes
and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into among, _inter alios, the relevant security_
provider, the Security Agent, also as Security Representative (as defined below) and agent (mandatario con
_rappresentanza), and, with respect to the Security Documents governed by Italian law, the Trustee acting for_
itself and in its capacity as trustee and agent (mandatario con rappresentanza), under the Indenture and also as
Noteholders’ Representative (as defined below).

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws,
only the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) will have the right to enforce the
Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee (including in its role as Noteholders’ Representative) and the
holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the
Indenture (including in its role as Noteholders’ Representative), who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) for the
Collateral. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the Existing Notes and the counterparties under certain hedging
agreements in relation to the Security Interest in favor of such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and
the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the
Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the
Indenture may be released under certain circumstances. See “—Release of Liens.” The validity and
enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents and the Indenture must be
exercised by the Security Agent. The Holders may only act through the Trustee (including in its role as
Noteholders’ Representative), who will instruct the Security Agent (including in its role as Security
Representative) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created (or confirmed and/or extended, as the case may be) under the Security Documents or
the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If
any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful,
the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the
Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created (or confirmed and/or extended, as
the case may be) by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility. These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes_
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The ability to enforce may also be_
restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in
compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the Existing Notes, the counterparties to
Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee (including in its role as Noteholders’
Representative) have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security


-----

Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such
Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. Furthermore, each holder will be deemed to have appointed
the Security Agent as agent (mandatario con rappresentanza) pursuant to article 1704 of the Italian Civil Code
and as security representative (rappresentante per le garanzie) pursuant to article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the
Italian Civil Code to act on its behalf. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of Existing
Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by
accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent (and, where applicable, the
Trustee) to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it
under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the
Security Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each
Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, confirmation, extension, renewal, replacement or
discharge expressed to be executed by the Security Agent (or, where applicable, the Trustee) in its name and on
its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the
section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will also provide that each holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements;

(2) authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee, as applicable, to act in its name and on its behalf to
enter into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby and to
perform their respective obligations and exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance
therewith;

(3) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(4) agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as security
representative (rappresentante per le garanzie) of the Holders for the purposes of Article 2414-bis,
third paragraph of the Italian Civil Code;

(5) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents; and

(6) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act in its name and on its behalf to enter
into and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Please see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes
_Guarantees—The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral” and_
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_IPO Debt Pushdown_**

The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) will provide (and the
Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that, on, in contemplation of, or following an Initial
Public Offering, the Issuer or its successor shall be entitled to require (by written notice, among others, to the
Trustee and the Security Agent) that the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such
notice) as described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Release
_and/or Transfer of Claims and Liabilities in Respect of any Senior Notes and the Notes and the Transaction_


-----

_Security— Provisions Following an IPO.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any_
amendment to the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or
the Security Documents required by the Issuer and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer in order
to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by this paragraph, including releasing security and
guarantees, provided that any such amendment or action will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee
or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—There are_
_circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be released_
_automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Collateral, or, in relation to clause (10) below, the Escrowed Property, will be automatically and
unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be discharged and be of no further force and effect):

(1)

(a) subject to clause (b) below, in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to
(i) a Person that is not Holdco (solely as regards the Security Interest in respect of the Capital
Stock of the Issuer), the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction
subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other
disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the_
Indenture or (ii) any Restricted Subsidiary; _provided_ that this clause (1)(a)(ii) shall not be
relied upon in the case of a transfer of capital stock or of accounts receivable to a Restricted
Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain
subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or
disposal; and

(b) any release of the Security Interest in respect of the Capital Stock of the Issuer pursuant to
clause (1)(a) shall only be permitted if such Capital Stock is subject to a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) in favor of the Holders of the
Notes as soon as reasonably practicable after such release;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor and
intercompany receivable claims against such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;”

(4) (a) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors
under the Indenture and the Notes or (b) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”_

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary and intercompany receivable claims against such Unrestricted Subsidiary

(6) in case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary following (or substantially
concurrently with) the release of its Liens granted in favor of the Revolving Credit Facility (other than
pursuant to a repayment and cancellation of the Revolving Credit Facility in full (other than in
connection with a refinancing with another secured credit facility)) or such other Indebtedness that
gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over the Collateral, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the release of the property and assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted
Subsidiary and intercompany receivable claims against such Restricted Subsidiary, provided that there
is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on such assets that would result in the requirement for the
Notes and the Notes Guarantees to be secured on such assets pursuant to the covenant described under


-----

“—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” or the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens;”_

(7) with respect to the Security Interests in respect of the entire Capital Stock of the IPO Entity and any
security granted by any of its holding companies (and security over intercompany receivables owing by
the IPO Entity and any of its holding companies), within a reasonable time to facilitate an Initial
Public Offering of the relevant IPO Entity or otherwise in connection with an IPO Debt Pushdown in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement; _provided_ that (a) security interests under Security
Documents exist or will upon the Initial Public Offering exist over the shares in a member of the Group
as selected by the Issuer which holds (directly or indirectly) all or substantially all of the assets of the
Group (the “Going Concern Assets”) such that a single point of enforcement in respect of the Going
Concern Assets will exist after the Initial Public Offering of the IPO Entity (in each case, as determined
by the Issuer in good faith)) and (b) such Security Interests so released shall be promptly granted in
favor of the Notes in the event that the Initial Public Offering does not complete for any reason and any
other releases in respect of an IPO Debt Pushdown in addition to the foregoing in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(9) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or the Security Documents;

(10) in relation to the Escrow Charge, upon release of the Escrowed Property in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge;

In addition, the Security Interest created (or confirmed and/or extended, as the case may be) by the Security
Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Agreed Security Principles and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”_

At the request of the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Trustee (if required) will take all necessary action
required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without
the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” and “—Post-Tender Optional
_Redemption,” the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer._

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

At any time on or after      , 2027, the Issuer may redeem the Fixed Rate Notes, in whole or in part, at its
option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice. These redemptions will be at the following
redemption prices (expressed as percentages of their principal amount at maturity), plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed
during the twelve-month period beginning          in each of the years set forth below:

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

_Optional Redemption prior to     , 2025 upon an Equity Offering_

At any time prior to     , 2025 upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer may on any
one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes
(including the original aggregate principal amount of any additional Floating Rate Notes) at a redemption price
of      % of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
excluding the redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date), with the net proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings.
The Issuer may only do this, however, if:

(a) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes (including
the original aggregate principal amount of any additional Floating Rate Notes) would remain
outstanding immediately after the proposed redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

_Optional Redemption prior to      , 2025_

At any time prior to      , 2025, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer may redeem
all or part of the Floating Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the
redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date).

_Optional Redemption on or after     , 2025_

On and after    , 2025, the Issuer may redeem the Floating Rate Notes, in whole or in part, at its option, upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a price of 100.000% plus accrued and unpaid interest and


-----

Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. Any such redemption
may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent. If such
redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the notice of such redemption shall
state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event
that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so
delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days
prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice
that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person, and such notice of redemption may be extended if such
conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the Issuer by notice to the Holders.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be
subject to redemption by the Issuer.

If requested in writing by the Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or
pursuant to the applicable Officer’s Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed,
designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the
Holders prior to the applicable redemption date; _provided,_ _however, that Holders shall have received at least_
three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of
redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable
redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs
or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a Global Note deposited with
a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests
as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system.
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be liable to any Holder by virtue of the Issuer instructing the Trustee
or the Paying Agent to make an early distribution of funds as described in this paragraph. Unless the Issuer
defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portion thereof
called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**_Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases_**

Other than a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption
or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be
required to offer to purchase the Notes as described under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” The Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or_
any of their affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in privately negotiated or open
market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, at such price and on such terms as they see fit. The amounts
involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.

**_Post-Tender Optional Redemption_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for or other offer to purchase the Notes
(including, without limitation, any Change of Control Offer and any Asset Disposition Offer), if Holders of not
less than 90% in aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Notes (or if the Issuer so elects, in its sole and
absolute discretion, any series of Notes) validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such tender
offer or other offer to purchase and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer or other offer to
purchase in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes (or if the Issuer or such third party so elects, in its sole


-----

and absolute discretion, such series of Notes) validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, all of
the Holders of the Notes (or if the Issuer or such third party so elects, in its sole and absolute discretion, such
series of Notes) will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer to purchase and accordingly, the
Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not
more than 30 days following such tender offer or other offer to purchase expiration date, to redeem the Notes (or
if the Issuer or such third party so elects, in its sole and absolute discretion, such series of Notes) that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase, at a price equal to the price offered (excluding
any early tender premium or similar payment) to each other Holder of Notes (or if the Issuer or such third party
so elects, in its sole and absolute discretion, such series of Notes) in such tender offer or other offer to purchase,
_plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional_
Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding such redemption date.

**_Redemption at Maturity_**

On    , 2031, the Issuer will redeem the Notes of each series that have not been previously redeemed or
purchased and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of the Notes of a relevant series are to be redeemed at any time, the Principal Paying Agent or the
Registrar will select Notes of the applicable series for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the
principal securities exchange, if any, on which such Notes are listed, and in compliance with the requirements of
Euroclear or Clearstream, or if such Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection
and such Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no
method of selection, on a pro rata basis; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal
amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed.
Neither the Principal Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with
this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in a daily newspaper with general circulation
in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) and in addition to such publication, not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. While in
global form, notices to Holders may be delivered via Euroclear and Clearstream in lieu of notice via registered
mail. Such notice of redemption may also be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.luxse.com) in lieu of publication in the Luxemburger Wort so long as the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange are complied with.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new
Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered
Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to
decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the
terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for
redemption.

Subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, the Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to
one or more of the relevant provisions of the Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with
respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions
made pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption dates.


-----

**_Redemption for Taxation Reasons_**

The Issuer may redeem any series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the relevant series of Notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under
“Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of
the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a
change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in
**Tax Law”),**

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Notes
would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such series of Notes (but, in the case of a
Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another
Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and such obligation
cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be
announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions
shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of
Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional
Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any series of Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to
its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized
standing to the effect that the Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of
a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and
opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further
inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**_Withholding Taxes_**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or
with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by
law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of a Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise
considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”),**


-----

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption
price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts
(the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in
respect of such payments, after such withholding, or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding
from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of
such payments on any such Note or any Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member
or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident
or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection
arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or
the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of
the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice
(at least 30 days before any such withholding would be payable), to provide certification, information,
documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such
beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement
relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but, only
to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or
documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment of the principal of, premium,
if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are on account of imposta sostitutiva (pursuant to Italian Legislative
Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time (“Legislative Decree
**No. 239”) and any related implementing regulations, and pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No.**
461 of November 21, 1997 (“Legislative Decree No. 461”) and any related implementing regulations))
and any related implementing regulations; provided that:

(i) Additional Amounts shall be payable in circumstances where the procedures required under
Legislative Decree No. 239 or Legislative Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an
exemption from imposta sostitutiva have not been complied with due solely to the actions or
omissions of the Payor or their agents; and

(ii) for the avoidance of doubt, no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to Taxes to
the extent such Taxes are on account of imposta sostitutiva if the Holder becomes subject to
_imposta sostitutiva after the Issue Date by reason of amendments to the list of countries which_
allow for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy, currently provided for by Italian
Ministerial Decree dated September 4, 1996, as subsequently amended, or by reason of the
approval of the ministerial Decree to be issued under art. 11 par .4 let c) of Legislative Decree
No. 239, as subsequently amended or superseded, providing for a new list of countries which
allow for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy, whereby such Holders country of
residence does not appear on the aforesaid amended or new list (the “White List”);


-----

(7) any Taxes to the extent that such Taxes result from payment to a non-Italian resident legal entity or a
non-Italian resident individual which is resident in a country which does not appear on the White List;

(8) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor
version of such sections that are substantively comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder,
any official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the
foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect
to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or
withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or
if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available,
certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made
available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Notes Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and
the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay
Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts
arises less than 30 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s
Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay, and will indemnify the Holder for, any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) or
any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties
or additions to tax) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of
any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Security Documents, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto (other than, in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this Offering) or the
receipt of any payments with respect thereto or any such taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related
interest, penalties, collection duties or additions to tax) imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in
connection with, the enforcement of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee or any Security Documents (limited,
solely in the case of any such taxes or similar charges or levies attributable to the receipt of any payments with
respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses


-----

(1) through (3) and (5) through (8) or any combination thereof) excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
registration, stamp duty, documentary or other similar tax, charge or levy arising from the execution of any
formality made directly by, or on behalf of the Holder and not necessary to maintain, preserve, establish, or
enforce the rights of such Holder under the Notes, any Notes Guarantee, any Security Document, the Indenture,
or any other document or instrument in relation thereto.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply
_mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax_
purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under,
or with respect to the Notes is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing
authority or agency thereof or therein.

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of
_Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Holder’s_
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be
obligated to repurchase any series of Notes as described under this heading, “Change of Control,” in the event
and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series as
described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes of a series as described under
“—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the
date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”)
to each Holder of any such Notes of such series, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed) and the record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not
paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect
of all Notes so properly tendered;


-----

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global
Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been properly
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail or deliver to each
Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the
Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail or deliver (or
cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive
Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided
that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or to the extent and in the manner
permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.luxse.com). In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, such notices to Holders
of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such
Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of
Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place
providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control may require a
mandatory prepayment of certain Indebtedness, including under the Revolving Credit Facility, or the making of
an offer to purchase the Existing Notes under the Existing Notes Indenture. In addition, certain events that may
constitute a change of control under certain Indebtedness, including the Revolving Credit Facility or the
Existing Notes Indenture and require a mandatory prepayment or making of an offer to purchase of
Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future
Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would
constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a
default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to
the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon
a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that
sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—Future liquidity and cash flow_


-----

_difficulties could prevent us from repaying the Notes when due or repurchasing the Notes when we are required_
_to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control_
_provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important_
_corporate events and we will not be required to purchase the Notes upon a Specified Change of Control Event.”_
Further, not all business combinations or acquisitions of us by third parties would necessarily result in a Change
of Control and would therefore not result in a Change of Control Offer to the Holders. The provisions of the
Indenture will not give Holders the right to require the repurchase of the Notes in the event of certain
transactions including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect
Holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. In addition, the
definition of “Change of Control” expressly permits a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction
which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of
the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree
of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of
the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred
and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the sale of assets, property and Capital Stock pursuant to a
Specified Asset Disposition will not constitute “substantially all assets” for any purpose under the Indenture.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

-----

_Restricted Payments” or any Permitted Payments provision under the fourth paragraph of the covenant_
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” may not be reduced below zero under this
provision); and

(18) [Reserved].

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the
second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that to the extent any Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to a fixed permission, at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratiobased permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such Indebtedness (or a portion thereof) shall
automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission from and after the first date on which the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, could have Incurred such Indebtedness
thereunder (to the extent the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries are able to Incur any Liens related to
such Indebtedness as Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens after such reclassification);
_provided_ that the Issuer may in its sole discretion further reclassify such Indebtedness into other
applicable clauses under the first and second paragraphs of this covenant;

(2) (a) [Reserved]; and (b) all Indebtedness Incurred under any Credit Facility (for the avoidance of doubt,
including the Revolving Credit Facility, but excluding any Hedging Obligations) that is secured by
Liens on the Collateral that are accorded super senior priority status under the Intercreditor Agreement
shall be deemed to have been Incurred under clause (1) (other than sub-paragraph (b) thereof) of the
second paragraph of this covenant and may not be reclassified;


-----

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments or “parallel debt” relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in
the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or second
paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to
other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” _pro forma_ effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and as otherwise set out in this “Description of the Notes”
as applicable;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP;

(9) the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any provision of this covenant or secured
pursuant to the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Liens” (a) shall be deemed to include all
amounts necessary to renew, refund, redeem, refinance, replace, restructure, defease or discharge any
such Indebtedness Incurred and/or secured pursuant to such provisions, including after giving effect to
additional Indebtedness in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest,
discounts, penalties, fees, premia and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
renewal, refund, redemption, refinancing, replacement, restructuring, defeasance or discharge; and (b)
in any case where such amounts are or may be based on Consolidated EBITDA (or any ratio of which
Consolidated EBITDA is a component), shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such
Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the amount of Consolidated
EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and such Lien will be permitted to be
refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or replacement, such
excess (and without prejudice to any deemed inclusions under (a) above) will continue); and

(10) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness incurred
under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid, including pursuant to “cash sweep”
or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to
have been incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first incurred and not on the date of any
subsequent reborrowing thereof; and

(11) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur Indebtedness or commits to Incur any
Lien, the Incurrence thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, for
purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio
or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, in each case, of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as applicable, or use of clauses (1) through (18) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for
borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined, at the Issuer’s
election, on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments
(assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date, provided that in the case of
making any calculation under the Indenture, such assumption should only be made to the extent that a
_pro forma adjustment is being taken into account in determining Consolidated EBITDA in connection_
with the proceeds of the use thereof (unless the Issuer elects otherwise)) or other Indebtedness, and, if


-----

such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio in each case, of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable,
test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or
re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Liens” irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net_
Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, in each case, of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing
or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the
committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of
credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the
“Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, in each case,
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable and subject to the terms of such definitions,
or other provision of the Indenture, and, to the extent the usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the
second preceding paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such
clauses, to the extent it would, if actually borrowed, be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or
(b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased
commitment, and, in each case, the Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to
time.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends
in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments
or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as
otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or
liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” the Issuer will not be permitted to designate such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted_
Subsidiary and any such designation will not be deemed operative under the Indenture).

For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, in a given
currency, the Issuer will be entitled to elect and determine the applicable exchange rate as set forth in “—
_Financial Calculations;”_ _provided_ that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness
denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro- denominated
restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the
definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) if and as elected by the Issuer, the euro equivalent of the principal
amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date may be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date or on the date on which such Indebtedness was originally
Incurred or committed; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to
a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the
amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro may, if elected by the Issuer, be adjusted to take into account the
effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, may be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing or, at the option of the Issuer, the
date when such Indebtedness was first committed.


-----

No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness
of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior Lien
basis.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the receipt of Net Cash
Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an
event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the purpose and
effect of the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities was to repay
Indebtedness to reduce the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that would not have
been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities and
(3) no Change of Control Offer is made in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture. Excluded
Amounts shall be limited to the amount of Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities
necessary to reduce the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries to cause the occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event, and amounts of Net Cash Proceeds
or marketable securities received in excess thereof shall not constitute Excluded Amounts.

fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by an Officer of the Issuer, or by the Board of Directors.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

securities, from such sale of Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution
will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated

concurrent sale of Preferred Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that, in
each case, is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” above, and that in each case, constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness;_

defeasing or otherwise acquiring or retiring such Subordinated Indebtedness; or

(c) consisting of Acquired Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred (A) to provide all or

transaction or series of transactions);

(5) any dividends paid within or redemption or repurchase consummated within 60 days after the date of

Restricted Subsidiary in amounts equal to (without duplication):

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any
cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment
shall be determined conclusively by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in clauses (1)
through (25) of the fourth paragraph of this covenant, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investment,” the Issuer will
be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or
later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including as an Investment
pursuant to one or more clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investment.”

For the avoidance of doubt, Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary in a Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to
purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent or any of the Issuer’s
Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of such Capital Stock or any Parent and to Affiliates
thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary. For the avoidance of doubt, a Permitted Investment shall not be deemed to
be a Restricted Payment pursuant to clause (1) of the definition thereof.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether


-----

owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom,
which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property
or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not
Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are
directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of
Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as
such Indebtedness is so secured (provided that a Lien to secure Indebtedness pursuant to clauses (1)(a) or (6)
under the second paragraph of the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant may have priority with respect to
the proceeds of any enforcement thereof not materially less favorable to the Holders than that accorded to the
Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement), and (b) in the case of any property or asset
that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—
_Security—Release of Liens.” Unless elected otherwise by the Issuer, property or assets which are only subject to_
a floating charge or general business charge under the Security Documents shall not constitute Collateral for the
purposes of the Indenture or any other Notes Document (except the Security Document creating such charge),
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, such property and assets may be secured by Permitted Collateral Liens
and released in accordance with the provisions described under “—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, accretion
of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing
Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any Indebtedness for borrowed money that contains a consensual encumbrance or
consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such
an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) the Notes Documents, (b) any Credit Facility (including
the Revolving Credit Facility), the Existing Notes and the Existing Notes Indenture, (c) the
Intercreditor Agreement, (d) the Security Documents, (e) any other agreement or instrument, in each
case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date (or the Acquisition Closing Date with respect to the
Target Group) or (f) any other agreement or instrument with respect to the Transactions in effect at or
entered into on the Issue Date (or the Acquisition Closing Date with respect to the Target Group);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted


-----

Subsidiary was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other
than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the
funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into in connection with
such transaction) and outstanding on such date; _provided_ that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if
another Person is the Successor Company (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any
Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed
acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the
Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument that extends, renews, refinances
or replaces any of the encumbrances or restrictions referred to in clause (1) through (16) of this
paragraph (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification
to an agreement referred to in clause (1) through (16) of this paragraph or this clause (3); _provided,_
_however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in_
any such agreement or instrument are (i) no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken
as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial
Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) (ii) not materially more
disadvantageous to the Holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable transactions; or (iii) not
adversely impacting, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make interest or principal payments
on the Notes (in each case, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Issuer;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property
or assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Lease Obligations
permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property
so acquired, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes
restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person
of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or
assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements, sale and leaseback agreements and
other similar agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions relating to pension fund and other employee benefit plan obligations or
arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order, or required
by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses;


-----

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or
suppliers, or as required by insurance, surety or bonding companies or indemnities in each case under
agreements or policies entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture, the Existing
Notes Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility, together with the security documents associated
therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is

affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments under the
Notes or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) any encumbrance or restrictions effected in connection with factoring, reverse factoring,
securitizations, receivables financings or similar arrangements, including (without limitation) in a

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:
the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is not less than the
fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of the
Asset Disposition, within 24 months of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition
and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender
offers or private negotiated transactions at market prices) any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; (ii) unless included in (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or private negotiated
transactions at market prices) Notes or Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral that is
not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes at a price of no more than 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes or such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption plus any applicable premia or make-whole; (iii)


-----

prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor
or any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case
other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided that the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Public
Debt (other than the Notes) pursuant to clause (ii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in
compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the
provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer, or otherwise prepays, repays, purchases or
redeems such Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total
aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate principal amount
of the Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Indebtedness
(other than the Notes) or (iv) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market
purchases, voluntary tender offers or private negotiated transactions at market prices) Subordinated
Indebtedness and/or any indebtedness of a Parent (and any proceed loans in respect of the foregoing)
(or make any payment in order to facilitate any such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption)
if the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries would be permitted to do so at such time under clause (10)(b)
and/or (c) of the fourth paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments;”_

(B) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such series of Notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date) (to the extent Holders elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the amount of Net
Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (as
defined below)), or redeem any series of Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture
or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all Holders of the Notes (in accordance with the procedures
set out below);

(C) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(E) make a capital expenditure;

(F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(H) enter into a commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) or
(F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, _provided_ that, a commitment shall be treated as a
permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such application is consummated, (y) the 180th day following the expiration of
the aforementioned 24 month period (such 180 day period being the “Commitment Period”) or, if that
commitment has been terminated during the Commitment Period, the 180th day after the date on which
that commitment was so terminated (the “Extended Commitment Period”), if such application has
not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph shall constitute “Excess
**Proceeds” in the following amounts and such determination may be made by the Issuer on any date on or after**
such Asset Disposition at the Issuer’s election:

(1) if the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
exceeds 5.00:1.00, 100% of such Net Available Cash; or

(2) if the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
exceeds 4.50:1.00 but does not exceed 5.00:1.00, 50% of such Net Available Cash; or


-----

(3) if the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
does not exceed 4.50:1.00, 0% of such Net Available Cash,

and any Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant to this paragraph shall be
immediately available to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purposes permitted by the Indenture,
including to make Restricted Payments in accordance with clause (20) of the definition of “Permitted
_Payments,” without regard to the periods specified in the second paragraph of this covenant._

Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving
credit borrowings or otherwise invest or use such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the
terms of the Indenture.

On the day after the end of the 24 month period above (or 1st day after the end of either the Commitment Period
or Extended Commitment Period, as applicable, if a commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into) after
an Asset Disposition, or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
exceeds (i) the greater of €60.0 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA in a single transaction or (ii) the
greater of €90.0 million and 30% of Consolidated EBITDA per year (excluding any Excess Proceeds under the
foregoing sub-clause (i) of this paragraph), the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make
an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other
outstanding Senior Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral
on a pari passu basis with the Notes to prepay, repay or repurchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and
any such Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies
that may be purchased, redeemed or prepaid out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes
in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness or Pari
Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase, redemption or prepayment plus any premia or make-whole, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Senior Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness,
as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in
the case of the Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu
Indebtedness so validly tendered (or in respect of which holders or lenders thereof accepted such offer) and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use
any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the covenants in the Indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Senior
Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders (or in respect of which
holders or lenders thereof accepted such offer), collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess
Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
prepaid, redeemed or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of Notes,
Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered and not withdrawn (or in respect of
which offers were accepted). For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their
euro equivalent as set out in “—Financial Calculations” as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the
Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount
of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected or otherwise offered or been required to prepay,
repay, redeem or purchase any amount of Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness or other Pari Passu Indebtedness
at a price of no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof under this covenant (including pursuant to any
Asset Disposition Offer), to the extent the Holders of the Notes or the creditors in respect of such Senior
Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness elect not to tender their Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness or
Pari Passu Indebtedness or accept any such offer for such prepayment, repayment, redemption or purchase or
have declined or refused any prepayment, repayment, redemption or purchase, such amount not tendered or
accepted, or such amount which is declined or refused, shall be deemed “Declined Proceeds.”

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in
respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are


-----

denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into
such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (or, in respect of other Senior Secured
Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness, if different, such other period prescribed by the terms thereof) (each an
“Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it
elects, Senior Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid, prepaid or purchased by it
pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been so validly tendered or accepted, all Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu
Indebtedness validly tendered or accepted in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the applicable Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer (or relevant Restricted Subsidiary, if
applicable) will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment (or make payment), on a pro rata basis to the extent
necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu
Indebtedness or portions of Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
(or in respect of which holders or lenders thereof accepted such offer) and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn, all Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn and in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that
such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this
covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five
Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder
an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such
Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the
applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate
from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note
to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that
each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so
accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the

Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of
related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of
€50.0 million and 15% Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of €80.0
million and 25% Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions


-----

have been approved by a resolution of the majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the
Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the fourth_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment;

(2) any issuance, transfer or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities,

arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights
plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation,
health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or
arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or
between or among any member of the Group and any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided
on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants, contractors or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or
controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions (or any steps or actions to effect, or in connection with, the Transactions),
including payment of all costs, transaction, underwriting, commitment and other fees and expenses

_Party Transactions” in this Offering Memorandum, as these agreements and instruments may be_
amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in
accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the
Holders in any material respect, and (iii) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or
other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement pursuant to
which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Parent is required or permitted to file a

with past practice;

(8) transactions with joint ventures, customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or
services, including in respect of Settlement Obligations or other similar arrangements, distribution
partners or franchisees, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice,
which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no
less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party;


-----

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity

Directors in good faith and (c) all reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Parent
or any Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its

management and shareholders of the Issuer, material affiliate transactions and a description of all

Chief Executive Officer of the Group or the Chief Financial Officer of the Group or a change in

a description of such event.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the
Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities
Act.


-----

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports
furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof and to the extent that
the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, by posting such reports on the official
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the
Issuer posts copies of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant on
such website, it will be deemed to have furnished such reports to the Trustee.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP as in
effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of GAAP as then in effect) and
on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information or set
out therein and/or except as may be required or necessary to reflect financial or related definitions in the
Indenture and. in the case of the reports prepared pursuant to clause (2) above, subject to year-end adjustments
and having regard to the fact they were not prepared for audit purposes; provided, however, that the reports set
forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in GAAP, present earlier periods on a basis
that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the
Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure
not of a type customarily included therein, in this Offering Memorandum or in the Target’s historic reporting. In
addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports”
covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

Subject to compliance with the paragraph below, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the
Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, the Euronext
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Milan Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the New York Stock
Exchange, NASDAQ or any regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the European Union,
and the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to
issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, the Euronext
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Milan Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the New York Stock
Exchange, NASDAQ or any regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the European Union, for
so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents
and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with such stock
exchange. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements require the
Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports
with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Milan
Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ or any regulated
stock exchange established in a Member State of the European Union, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed
to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as
to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such
annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the
SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the Trustee, the
Holders of the Notes and prospective purchasers of the Notes if such information referenced above has been
posted on the Issuer’s website.


-----

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this “Reports”
covenant by providing any report or financial statements (x) of the Target or (y) of a Parent, in each case, in lieu
of those for the Issuer, so long as such reports (if an annual or quarterly report) meet the relevant requirements
(including as to content and time of delivery) of this “Reports” covenant as if references to the Issuer therein
were references to the Target or a Parent, as the case may be, (as determined at the sole discretion of the Issuer).
Upon complying with the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence, the Issuer will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, if delivering
reports or financial statements of a Parent, no indebtedness of any Parent shall be taken into account when
making any calculations otherwise required under the Indenture. To the extent any material differences exist
between the assets or results of operations or financial condition of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand and the Target or any Parent (as applicable) that is the reporting entity and its respective Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, the annual and quarterly reports shall include an explanation and an unaudited reconciliation or
overview of such material differences.

Any reports in respect of periods commencing prior to the Acquisition Closing Date (including in respect of any
comparative information) may, upon the election of the Issuer, include only the consolidated financial
information of the Target Group without any other financial information. For purposes of this covenant and any
determination or calculation to be made under the Indenture, the Issuer may use financial statements of the
Target Group for reporting or making calculations with respect to periods commencing prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date but for the purposes of any calculations to be made under the Indenture, after giving pro forma
effect to the Transactions.

In the event any member of the Group makes an acquisition of any person after the Issue Date (each such
person, together with its Subsidiaries, being an “Acquired Entity”), for accounting periods any part of which
fall on or prior to the date 12 months from the date of completion of such acquisition:

(1) to the extent financial statements are required to be delivered in relation to any such accounting period,
separate financial statements may be delivered in respect of the Acquired Entity for that period (as
applicable) (and in the event separate accounts or statements are delivered pursuant to this paragraph
(i), any requirement in paragraph (1) above referring to financial statements of, or the consolidated
financial position of, the Group (or similar language) shall be construed as to be a reference to the
Group excluding the Acquired Entity);

(2) any financial statements delivered pursuant to paragraph (i) may be in a form as customarily prepared
by the Acquired Entity prior to the date of completion of such acquisition (and financial statements
delivered in such form shall satisfy the provisions of paragraph (1) above); and

(3) for the purpose of calculating any financial ratio under the Indenture any financial statements delivered
pursuant to paragraph (i) may be aggregated with any quarterly or annual financial statements for the
relevant period, as applicable (and appropriate adjustments made for any intra-group transactions).

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, in the event that any period specified in the Indenture
for the Group to deliver any financial statements, documents or other information expires on a day which is not
a Business Day, that period shall be extended so as to expire on the next Business Day.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
**Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the**
European Union (or former member of the European Union), the United Kingdom, or the United States
of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume,
(a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to


-----

the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of
the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able to
Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate, to the effect that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture
and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been authorized,
executed and delivered and is, subject to customary qualifications and assumptions, a legal, valid and
binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company (in each case, subject to customary
qualifications and assumptions, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided
that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of
fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be
Incurred by any Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in
compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have
been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and
assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “Merger and
_Consolidation” covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the_
Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”
and (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets of such
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person; or


-----

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, becomes a Guarantor;

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the
obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a
supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee); and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Indenture,

_provided however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this covenant shall not apply to the_
extent that compliance with clauses (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or
violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin
capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or
regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the
officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or
shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):
(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of
its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of its
properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule,
regulation or order, recommendation or directions of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer
into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the
relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under
the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; (v) a Permitted Reorganization or the liquidation or
winding up of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (vi) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating
into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such
entity; _provided,_ _however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (3)(A) or_
(3)(B) under the heading “—The Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction; (vii) any
Specified Asset Disposition and (viii) any transaction or arrangement pursuant to an IPO Debt Pushdown.

**_Post-Closing Reorganization_**

Following the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
the Post-Closing Reorganization as a result of which the Issuer will merge into the Target under a reverse
merger (with the Target being the surviving entity) within 18 months following the Acquisition Closing Date,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles and any relevant approval and/or authorisation by any competent
authority. For the avoidance of doubt, failure to complete the Post-Closing Reorganization shall not constitute a
Default or an Event of Default. The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be
deemed to have agreed to the consummation of the Post-Closing Reorganization and the assumption by the
Target of all obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Notes Documents in accordance with the Indenture upon
completion of the Post-Closing Reorganization for the purposes of Articles 2503 and 2503-bis (et seq.) of the
Italian Civil Code.

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**


-----

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing
until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the
provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness;”

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries;”

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions;”

(5) “—Additional Notes Guarantees;”

(6) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock;” and

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard
to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the
Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default.
The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of
the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness
Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue
Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or
Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take
actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the
contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no
longer having an Investment Grade Status. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the amount of Excess
Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event or
a Reversion Date, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants
described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or
maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to
take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders
and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens or Indebtedness or other obligations
secured by the Collateral (to the extent otherwise permitted by the Indenture) and may effect a Permitted
Reorganization and the Collateral may be discharged and released and retaken, if applicable, in accordance with
the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and (ii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced, from time to time to (a) cure any ambiguity, mistake,
omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (b) comply with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (c) add to the Collateral, (d) evidence the succession of another Person to
the Issuer, a Guarantor, or any security provider, as applicable, and the assumption by such successor of the


-----

obligations under the Indenture, Notes or its Guarantee, as the case may be, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable, in each case, in accordance with
the caption “—Merger and Consolidation,” (e) provide for the release of property and assets constituting
Collateral from the Liens created under the Security Documents and/or the release of a Guarantor from its
Guarantee of the Notes, in each case, in accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms of the Indenture, (f)
conform the Security Documents to this “Description of the Notes” or the Agreed Security Principles (g)
evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Security Agent, or (h) make any
other change thereto that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material respect (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer); _provided,_ _however, that in the case of clause (i) above, except with_
respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly
permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released and retaken, if
applicable, or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer
delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors or an Officer of
the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest after giving effect
to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security
Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that
such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Notes Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, any Credit Facility which is a term facility which
constitutes Senior Secured Indebtedness or Junior Lien Indebtedness having an outstanding aggregate principal
amount exceeding the greater of €60.0 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA or any other Public Debt, in
each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) such Restricted
Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor by no later than 10 Business Days after the date on which the Guarantee is
Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which
such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee, which Notes Guarantee will be senior to or _pari_
_passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness;_ _provided,_ _however, that such_
Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the
Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules,
capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous
restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case
of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3)
any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-ofpocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses Incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory
filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (2) undertaken in connection with such
Guarantee which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary. At the option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on such Guarantor’s
liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financials assistance,
corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph shall not be


-----

applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that already existed at the time such Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any guarantee provided by a member of the Target
Group existing on the Acquisition Closing Date).

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Notes
_Guarantees.” A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the_
date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after
the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had
not been designated as a Guarantor, or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was
Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the
date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the
Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes
Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any_
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, in connection
with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the
holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing
Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially
less favorable to the Holders), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of Notes
Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interest; _provided_ that such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or restatement, amendment or modification of the Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as
applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness
covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to
any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the
Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of
the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens, (7)
amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms
thereof (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any
material respect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) or (9) to facilitate a Permitted Reorganization. The
Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below
under “Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.


-----

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided,_ _however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant_
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Financial Calculations**

When determining the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture in connection with any
transaction or making any calculation as to whether such transaction is permitted under the Indenture (including,
for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any Incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness or Liens, the
making of any Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or Investment, any Asset Disposition, any acquisition,
merger, joint venture, consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination and any other transaction
requiring the testing of any basket or ratio, including, without limitation, in determining whether a Change of
Control constitutes a Specified Change of Control Event), the date of determination of such basket or ratio or the
testing of any such transaction and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be any
Relevant Transaction Date, and such baskets or ratios may, at the option of the Issuer, be calculated with such
_pro forma_ adjustments as are contemplated by the _pro forma_ provisions set forth in the definition of
Consolidated EBITDA and the definition of Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and as otherwise
contemplated by the Indenture after giving effect to such transaction and other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any
such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the
avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or
ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or
that arises from an asset or a target company subject to such transaction) subsequent to such date of
determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be
deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the
transaction is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation
of such transaction or related transactions, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer; _provided_ that if the Issuer
elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement or other Relevant
Transaction Date which is prior to the transaction occurring and elects to make pro forma adjustments as though
they had occurred, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
therefrom) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered or such other
Relevant Transaction Date and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the
Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such transaction. To the extent the
date of determination of a basket or ratio is tested prior to the date of consummation of a transaction, such
basket or ratio shall be deemed utilized to the same extent until the earlier of the date of consummation of such
transaction or the date such transaction is terminated or expires without consummation, except that in the case of
an acquisition, merger or consolidation, any calculation for purposes other than Incurrences of Indebtedness or
Liens or the making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition, merger or consolidation) shall not
reflect such transaction until it has been consummated.

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (2) of the third paragraph of the “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
covenant, if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is Incurred or entered into
pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based
permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion
thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission provided that the Issuer may further
reclassify into other applicable clauses, in its sole discretion.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, unless the Issuer elects otherwise, in the event any fixed permissions
are intended to be utilized together with any ratio-based permissions in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, (i) compliance with or satisfaction of any ratio-based permission for the portion of such applicable
transaction or action to be incurred under such ratio-based permission shall first be calculated without giving
effect to amounts being utilized pursuant to any fixed permission but giving full pro forma effect to all


-----

applicable and related transactions and all other permitted pro forma adjustments, and (ii) thereafter, incurrence
of the portion of such applicable transaction or action to be incurred under any fixed permissions shall be
calculated.

When determining availability under any numerical basket under the Indenture, if the corresponding percentage
of Consolidated EBITDA exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time, the numerical permission
shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the corresponding percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA reached from time to time and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in
Consolidated EBITDA.

For any relevant basket, threshold, test, permission or provision set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year,
a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(1) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket, threshold, test,
permission or provision during such Annual Period may be increased by: (i) (a) an amount equal to
100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in any preceding Annual Periods
and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Periods
and (b) an amount equal to any unused capacity accumulated from the Existing Notes Issue Date to but
excluding the Issue Date under the corresponding basket or permission in the Existing Notes Indenture
(the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (ii) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in any
following Annual Periods and the permitted amount in such following Annual Periods shall be reduced
by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(2) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such basket, threshold, test, permission or
provision during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (1) above, any usage
thereof during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (i) first,
against the Carry Forward Amount; (ii) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such
Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (1) above; and (iii) third, against the
Carry Back Amount.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary and without double counting, in respect of any relevant basket or
permission calculated by reference to capacity built-up since the Issue Date or subject to carry forward under the
Indenture, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket will be increased by an amount equal to any
unused capacity accumulated from the Existing Notes Issue Date to but excluding the Issue Date under the
corresponding basket or permission in the Existing Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect
to (A) clause (13)of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”); and
(B) the first paragraph and clause (14) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments.”_

For the purposes of calculating the availability or permission under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, the
exchange rate (including for the purposes of determining any interest) used in any financial definition or
components thereof shall be, at the option of the Issuer, (i) the prevailing rate of exchange as determined by the
Issuer (acting reasonably); (ii) the weighted average exchange rate for the applicable measurement period used
by the Issuer to calculate Consolidated EBITDA (as determined by the Issuer); (iii) any applicable conversion
rate used in any relevant financial statements or management accounts; (iv) any applicable conversion rate
selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) as of the relevant date of determination; (v) the spot
rate of exchange on the issue date of the Existing Notes, the Issue Date or the Acquisition Closing Date, or (vi)
any applicable conversion rate under any Currency Agreement or other currency hedging arrangement entered
into by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or breach
of any undertaking or covenant shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change in the euro equivalent
amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

References to any transaction being in the “ordinary course of business” of the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the Group) for all purposes under the Indenture shall include any transaction that is consistent
with industry practice in the industries in which the Group operates (or, if the transaction is not specific to the
Group’s industry, any industry generally) or consistent with past practice of any member of the Group. Any
determination as to compliance with a particular basket, ratio, threshold, test or permission by the Issuer in good
faith shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive.


-----

Any determination to be made in good faith by the Issuer under the Indenture may be exercised or made by the
Board of Directors, the CEO, the CFO or another Officer of the Issuer or the Target.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders
of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the
Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, indebtedness under any Hedging Obligations or Subordinated Shareholder Funding
or ancillary facilities made available under the Revolving Credit Facility) by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has
been so accelerated, and such payment default and acceleration are continuing, exceeds the greater of
€200.0 million and 65% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Holdco, the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments exceeding the greater of
€200.0 million and 65% of Consolidated EBITDA (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance
company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a
period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a
fair market value in excess of the greater of €200.0 million and 65% of Consolidated EBITDA for any
reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such
security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in writing that any such
security interest is invalid, or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days, in each case,
which is materially adverse to Noteholders’ interest as a whole under the Note Documents; and


-----

(8) any Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or
any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Notes Guarantee and any such
Default continues for 10 days, in each case, which is materially adverse to Noteholders’ interest as a
whole under the Notes Documents.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify
the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8), the Issuer does not cure such default
within 30 days or such longer time specified in clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8), as applicable, of this paragraph
after receipt of such notice. A notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a
notice of Default, notice of acceleration or to take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of
Default may not be given with respect to any action taken or any event which has occurred and been reported to
the Noteholders by the Trustee or reported publicly more than two years prior to such notice of Default, notice
of acceleration or other instruction to the Trustee.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing,
the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such
Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under
the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because
an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the
declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default
triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of
the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full,
within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction
and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Any notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of
Default under the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under
the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first
paragraph of this section or direction to take (or refrain from taking) any other action with respect to an alleged
Default or Event of Default the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one
or more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such
Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not or, in the case such Holder is a nominee of Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not, Net
Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a
notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise
ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. The principal amount of the outstanding Notes held by any
Directing Holder that does not provide a Position Representation in respect of any Noteholder Direction shall be
deemed to be zero for the purposes of both the numerator and denominator in determining whether any requisite
proportion of Holders of Notes have given the Trustee a particular instruction in respect of the Notes. In
addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the
Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the
accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a
“Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee, any
Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner
of the Notes in lieu of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or its nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of
its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (which shall also be


-----

provided to any such Holder) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable basis
to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification
Covenant and (ii) has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such
Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event
of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of
Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be
automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee
shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant or
(ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with
respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed
pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in
such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the
participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided
such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such
Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to
have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received
such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to
act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to
such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be
permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing
Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the
Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such
Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The
Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it
in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made
therein.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may
not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past
or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or
Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind and annul any acceleration with respect to such Notes and its
consequences (or provide an instruction not to accelerate) if such rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture
at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to
enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to
pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding; and


-----

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will
be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct
of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all
losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default
occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give
notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a
Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold
notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (or 150 days for the
fiscal year ending on December 31, 2024), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signer thereof knows
of any continuing Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to
deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any continuing Defaults,
their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (A) if a Default (including an Event of Default) has occurred but is no longer
continuing (a “Cured Default”), any other Default or Event of Default which would not have arisen but for the
Cured Default having occurred shall be deemed not to be continuing automatically upon, and simultaneous with
the remedy, cure or waiver of the Cured Default, (B) if a Default (including an Event of Default) occurs for a
failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate, notice or other document in connection with another
default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is remedied or waived, such Default
(including an Event of Default) for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate, notice or other document
or information in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (C) any
Default (including an Event of Default) for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the
covenant “Reports” herein, or otherwise to deliver any notice, certificate or other document or information, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture or any other
Notes Document shall be deemed to be cured and remedied upon the delivery of any such report, notice,
certificate or other document or information required by such covenant or performance of such obligation, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture or any other
Notes Document.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunding to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for
the Trustee to take certain actions, steps or proceedings in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such
circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and
it will be for Holders to take action, steps or proceedings directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of Holders of at least a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to
certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in an outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), provided, in each case,
that if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the Notes, only the consent of
the Holders of at least a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series (and not
the consent of at least a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of all Notes), shall be required.
However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 75% of the then outstanding aggregate principal
amount of the Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non

-----

consenting Holder (for the avoidance of doubt, if a modification, waiver or amendment will only affect one
series of the Notes, only the consent of the Holders of the requisite percentage of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Notes of such series will be required):

(1) reduce the proportion of the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note
may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption;”

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts, if
any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of
any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes
in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer
or the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
other than in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the applicable Security Documents;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes
by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in clauses (1) through (10) of this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent
and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material
respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;


-----

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “Certain Covenants—Additional
_Notes Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the_
benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any
Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in
respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or
retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) conform the text of the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement, the
Escrow Charge or the Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such
provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of
the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge or
the Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent
pursuant to the requirements thereof or provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to
any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility, in
any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect
on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required
to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the
Collateral for the benefit of any Person; _provided_ that the granting of such security interest is not
prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied
with;

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements;” or

(11) facilitate an IPO Debt Pushdown or any transaction that complies with the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation.”_

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Luxembourg in a daily
newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the _Luxemburger Wort). Such_
notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may also be published on the website of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com).

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling,
or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not
to be outstanding.

**Meeting of Holders of Notes**

A meeting of the Holders of the Notes will be convened in the cases provided for under article 2415 of the
Italian Civil Code and a resolution therein will be sanctioned in accordance with the mandatory provisions of
Italian law. All meetings of Holders of the Notes will be held in accordance with applicable Italian laws and
regulations.


-----

In addition to and without prejudice to the provisions described above under the caption “—Amendments and
_Waivers,” in accordance with the provisions set forth under the Italian Civil Code, the Indenture will include_
provisions for the convening of meetings of the Holders of the Notes to consider any matter affecting their
interests, including, without limitation, the modification or abrogation by extraordinary resolution of any
provisions of the Notes or the Indenture. A meeting may be convened either (i) by the Board of Directors of the
Issuer, (ii) by the Noteholders’ Representative (as defined below) or (iii) upon request by holders of at least
5.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

In accordance with the Italian Civil Code, the vote required to pass a resolution by a meeting of the Holders of
Notes will be (i) in the case of the first meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of more than
one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, and (ii) in the case of the second and any
further adjourned meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of at least two-thirds of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes so present or represented at such meeting. Any such second or further
adjourned meeting will be validly held if there are one or more persons present that hold or represent Holders of
more than one-third of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes; _provided, however, that the_
Issuer’s bylaws may provide for a higher quorum (to the extent permitted under Italian law). Certain proposals,
as set out under Article 2415 paragraph 1, item 2, and paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (namely, the
amendment of the economic terms and conditions of the Notes) may only be approved by an extraordinary
resolution passed at a meeting of Holders of the Notes (including any adjourned meeting) by one or more
persons present that hold or represent holders of not less than one-half of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes.

With respect to the matters set forth in the second paragraph under “—Amendments and Waivers,” and to the
extent permitted under Italian law, the Indenture will contractually increase the percentage of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes otherwise required by Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code to pass an extraordinary
resolution with respect to such matters from 50% to 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The
_Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all holders of the_
_Notes with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.” Any_
resolution duly passed at any such meeting shall be binding on all the holders of the Notes, whether or not such
holder was present at such meeting or voted to approve such resolution. To the extent provided by the Italian
Civil Code, the resolutions passed by a meeting of Holders of the Notes can be challenged by Holders pursuant
to Articles 2377 and 2379 of the Italian Civil Code.

The Indenture will provide that the provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” will be in
addition to, and not in substitution of, the provisions described under the caption “—Amendments and Waivers.”
As such and notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement and/or waiver, in addition to
complying with the provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” must also comply with the
other provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

This section “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” is subject to compliance with Italian law in all respects.

**Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative**

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of the Notes
on the Issue Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of the Holders of the
Notes of the initial appointment as of the Issue Date of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security
representative (rappresentante per le garanzie) pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil
Code (the “Security Representative”) in order to create and grant in its favor security interests and guarantees
securing and guaranteeing the Notes and entitle it to exercise in the name and on behalf of the Holders of the
Notes all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to such security
interests and guarantees. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture each holder of the Notes from time to time, by
accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch as Security Representative.

Moreover, a representative of the Holders of the Notes (rappresentante comune) (the “Noteholders’
**Representative”) may be appointed pursuant to Articles 2415 and 2417 of the Italian Civil Code by the Holders**
of the Notes in order to represent the interests of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2418 of the Italian
Civil Code as well as to give effect to resolutions passed at a meeting of the Holders of the Notes. If the
Noteholders’ Representative is not appointed by a meeting of the Holders of the Notes, the Noteholders’


-----

Representative shall be appointed by a decree of the Court where the Issuer has its registered office upon request
by one or more Holders of the Notes or upon request by the directors of the Issuer. The Noteholders’
Representative remains appointed for a maximum period of three financial years but may be subsequently
reappointed thereafter.

This section “—Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative” is subject to compliance with Italian
law in all respects.

**Italian Usury Law**

Notwithstanding any provisions in the Indenture to the contrary, (x) the Issuer and each Guarantor (by signing
the Indenture and any supplemental indenture, as applicable) and (y) each Holder (by accepting any of the
Notes) shall be deemed to have acknowledged, accepted and agreed that, if the remuneration applicable to the
Notes (including interest, default interest, fees, charges, expenses and other costs and any other form of
compensation related to the Notes (the “Total Remuneration”)) at any time exceeds the maximum
remuneration permitted under Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996, as amended from time to time and related
implementing rules and regulations (the “Italian Usury Law”), then the Total Remuneration shall immediately
and automatically be reduced to the maximum admissible remuneration pursuant to the Italian Usury Law for,
and limited to, the period during which it is not possible to apply the remuneration as originally provided.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described under
“Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) and
“Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default”
above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the
bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision,
the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events of Default” above
(“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event
of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Issuer and Significant
Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
**trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-**
denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with
certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred
(and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based


-----

on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax
law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may
reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for
in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the
Principal Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity
within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Principal Paying Agent in the name, and
at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another
entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose), cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government
Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal,
premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or
to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all
other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to
apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case
may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each
to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture
relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with, _provided_ that any such
counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the
foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

If requested in writing by the Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or
pursuant to the applicable Officer’s Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed,
designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the
Holders prior to the applicable redemption date, provided, however, that Holders shall have received at least
three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of
redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable
redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs
or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a Global Note deposited with
a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests
as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system.
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be liable to any Holder by virtue of the Issuer instructing the Trustee
or the Paying Agent to make an early distribution of funds as described in this paragraph.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each


-----

Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer
of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the
Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received
written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use
the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of
the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee, the Security Agent or any Agent will be permitted to engage in
other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to
meet certain eligibility requirements or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or
bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes
expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange so require, notices with respect to the Notes of the Issuer will be published in a daily newspaper
with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or if, in the opinion of
the Issuer such publication is not practicable, in an English language newspaper having general circulation in
Europe. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the
Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Such notices may also be
published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com) in lieu of publication in the
_Luxemburger Wort so long as the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange allow._

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are physically
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the day after being so mailed; and provided, further,
that any notice delivered via e-mail or other electronic means shall be deemed to have been given on the date
such notice was “sent” in accordance with the terms of this paragraph. Any notice or communication mailed to a
Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently
given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a
Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives
it. For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered
via Euroclear and Clearstream in lieu of notice via registered mail. If a notice or communication is given
through Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.


-----

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will
be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the
Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable due date
for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if
any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount
received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or
order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by
any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will
only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which
the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of
that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it
is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or
the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify the recipient or the
Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this
currency indemnity provision, it will be _prima facie_ evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a
Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of
information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and
independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and
independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the
Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite
any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or
any Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a noneuro currency shall be calculated the manner set out in the section titled “—Financial Calculations.”

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit
the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. There can be no assurance that the application to list the
Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes on the Euro MTF Market
will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the
United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium,
interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes,
may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes,
the Issuer will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.


-----

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Charge and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

_(provided_ that, the Bund Rate shall never be less than 0%) at such redemption date plus 50
basis points and assuming that the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes for the period
from the redemption date through       , 2025 will equal the rate of interest on the
Floating Rate Notes in effect on the date on which the applicable notice of redemption is
given; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Floating Rate Note,

as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate.

For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty of the Trustee,
the Calculation Agent, or any Paying Agent or Registrar.

course of business or consistent with past practice), transfer, issuance or other disposition, or a series of related

redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness or has caused any Reserved Indebtedness Amount
to be deemed to be Incurred subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Total
Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation
of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio is made (for the purpose of this definition, the “Calculation
**Date”), then the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving** _pro forma_ effect (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer) to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase,
redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same
had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period if it would otherwise be included in
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect
to (unless or except to the extent elected otherwise by the Issuer in respect of any particular calculation) (i) any

_Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio_

Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio permission) clause (17), in each case, in the second paragraph under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or (ii) the discharge on the Calculation Date of any_
Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds incurred pursuant to the provisions
described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than
Indebtedness Incurred in reliance on the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio pursuant to clause (5)(ii)(B) or
clause (17), in each case, in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”).

Calculation Date, shall be given pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer and may
include anticipated synergies, cost savings and operating expense reductions, operating cost
improvements, revenue increases, revenue enhancements and any other expense and cost reductions or

definitive documentation has been entered into with respect to a Purchase that is part of the transaction
causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated
after giving _pro forma_ effect to such Purchase (including anticipated synergies, cost savings and
operating expense reductions, operating cost improvements, revenue increases, revenue enhancements


-----

and any other expense and cost reductions or (in each case) similar) as if such Purchase had occurred
on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of the date of
determination;

determined in accordance with GAAP, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a
business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date,
shall be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period
(taking into account anticipated synergies, cost savings and operating expense reductions, operating
cost improvements, revenue increases, revenue enhancements and any other expense and cost
reductions or (in each case) similar resulting from any such disposal, as determined in good faith by the
Issuer);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance
with GAAP, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and
ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been
a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest
expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated at the Issuer’s option, either (x) as if the rate in effect
on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any
Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness or (y) using the average rate in effect over the
period, and if any Indebtedness is not denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that
Indebtedness for purposes of the calculation of Consolidated Total Net Leverage shall be treated in
accordance with GAAP); and

(7) the reasonably anticipated full run rate effect of synergies, cost savings and operating expense
reductions, operating cost improvements, revenue increases, revenue enhancements and any other
expense and cost reductions or (in each case) similar (as determined in good faith by the Issuer)
projected to result from actions taken or commenced or expected to be taken or committed to be taken
by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be included as though such synergies, cost savings and
operating expense reductions, operating cost improvements, revenue increases, revenue enhancements
and any other expense and cost reductions or (in each case) similar had been achieved on the first day
of the relevant period, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such
actions, and provided that such adjustments are not duplicative of any of those items already included

Consolidated Interest Expense, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Net Income,
calculations will be determined in accordance with the terms set forth above and those defined terms.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”).

The Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S (will initially be represented by one or more
global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and,
together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of
Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking S.A.
(“Clearstream”) and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary. Except as set forth
below, each series of the Notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of €100,000
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only
against payment in immediately available funds.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and,
together with the Rule 144A Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such
participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Indenture governing
the Notes and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Euroclear
and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’
securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the
limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to
receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your
ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders
of Book- Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and/ or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear,
Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to
exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominee), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary
will surrender such Global Note to the Paying Agent for a cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption,
the Common Depositary will request the Paying Agent to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global
Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption.
The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to
the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such
Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit
their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such
other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; _provided,_ _however, that, subject to applicable procedures of_


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream, no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed
in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent who will make payment to or to the
order of the Common Depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all
such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described
under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be
made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will pay
additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global
Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such
holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the
case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and
customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such
participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or
any of their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the Common Depositary
(or its nominee)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any of
their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be paid to
holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euros.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither the Issuer nor the relevant Trustee nor the Initial
Purchasers nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person
for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or
rounding effected in connection with any such payment.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as
to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the
“Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.


-----

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may
change from time to time.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers as discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Prior to 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the Issue Date, the Notes sold in
reliance on Regulation S may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of,
U.S. persons, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests denominated in the
same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the
U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of
the Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in
the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly,
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in
the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating
procedures may change from time to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, nor
any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or
their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes if:

- Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for
the Global Notes, and the Issuer fails to appoint a successor;

- Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

- the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.


-----

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is
to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of BookEntry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes (subject to receipt of the same from the
Issuer), registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and
based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests),
and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless
that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and
any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of
a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered
Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in
respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as
applicable; _provided_ that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing,
packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees
normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its
authenticating agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s
requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive
Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Issuer to
protect the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any
loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for the
expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof in accordance with the rules thereof. There is no assurance
that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market.

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive
Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
d’Wort). Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will
be payable at the office of the Paying Agent in Luxembourg so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require.


-----

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

**_Initial Settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional euro bonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
holders on the Business Day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary Market Trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of
any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special Timing Considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same Business Day as in the United States. U.S. investors who
wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular
day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next Business Day in Luxembourg if
Clearstream is used, or Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**_Clearing Information_**

The Issuer expects that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and
Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes numbers for the Notes are
set out under “Listing and General Information.”

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as
a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor
their respective agents take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors
to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders.
Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons
or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that,
under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the relevant Trustee requests any action by owners of


-----

Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is
entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the
relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect
participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of
beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and the Code impose certain
requirements on employee benefit plans subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and
other plans and arrangements that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), such as individual retirement accounts, as well as on
entities that are deemed to hold “plan assets” of such employee benefit plans, plans, accounts or arrangements
within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (collectively,
“Plans”), and certain duties on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to such Plans. Under ERISA and
the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Plan
or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or
other compensation to such a Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Plan.

A fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in order to determine if the investment satisfies the
fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and
diversification and delegation of control.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Plan
and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” within the meaning of ERISA or “disqualified persons”
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or
administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages
in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and/or other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and
the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Plan that engaged In such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel
regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code or any Similar Law (as defined below) to such an investment, and to confirm that such
purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation
of an applicable requirement of ERISA.

Non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of
ERISA) and certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are
substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code (“Similar Law”) (collectively, “Similar Law Plans”). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with
their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any
exemptive relief under any such law or regulations.

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Guarantors or any other
party to the transactions contemplated by this Offering Memorandum or any of their respective affiliates (the
“Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase
or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice
based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to
purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties
with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of
the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific
purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser
on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Exemptions**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things,
whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest
or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and a party in interest or a
disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified


-----

person, of any Plan assets. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by a Plan with respect to which a
Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or
indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the
investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited
transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be
applicable to the purchase and holding of Notes by a Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the
fiduciary making the decision to acquire such Notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified
person to the Plan. Depending on the satisfaction of certain conditions which may include the identity of the
Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire or hold the Notes on behalf of a Plan, Section 408(b)(17) of
ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code or certain prohibited transaction class exemptions issued by the
United States Department of Labor, including Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14
(relating to transactions effected by an independent “qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1
(relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments
by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general
accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) (collectively, the
“Class Exemptions”) could provide an exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code. However, there can be no assurance that any of these Class Exemptions or any other
exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that, for so long as it holds such Note, (A) either (i) it is not, and no portion of
the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes
assets of any Plan or Similar Law Plan, or (ii)(x) the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes (or any
interest therein) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Law, and (y) none of
the Transaction Parties is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) to any Plan or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Plan with respect to the
decision to purchase or hold the Notes or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in
a fiduciary capacity with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes, and (B) it will not sell or
otherwise transfer such Notes or any interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed
to make these same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase and holding of such
Note or any interest therein.

**The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity**
**of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited**
**transactions, it is particularly important that each Plan fiduciary (and each fiduciary for a Similar Law**
**Plan) consult with its legal advisor concerning the potential consequences to the plan under ERISA, the**
**Code or such Similar Laws of an investment in the Notes. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a**
**representation by any Transaction Party or any of their respective affiliates or representatives that such**
**an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan or that**
**such investment is appropriate for any such Plan.**


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**OECD COMMON REPORTING STANDARDS**

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has developed a common reporting
standard (“CRS”) to achieve a comprehensive and multilateral automatic exchange of information on a global
basis. A number of jurisdictions (including Italy) signed the OECD’s multilateral competent authority
agreement (“Agreement”) to automatically exchange information under the CRS.

The CRS requires certain financial institutions to report information regarding certain accounts (which may
include the Notes credited to such accounts) to their local tax authority and follow related due diligence
procedures. A jurisdiction that has signed the Agreement may provide this information to other jurisdictions that
have signed the Agreement.

Consequently, holders of the Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications to any
financial institution resident in a jurisdiction that has signed the Agreement (including Italy) through which
payments on the Notes are made.

The holders of Notes who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisors on the
individual impact of CRS on their position.

**CERTAIN ITALIAN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The statements herein regarding Italian taxation are based on the laws and published practices of the Italian tax
authorities in effect in Italy as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any changes in law
and interpretation occurring after such date, which changes could be made on a retroactive basis. The Issuer will
not update this summary to reflect changes in laws and if such changes occur the information in this summary
may become invalid. The following is a general summary only of certain material Italian tax consequences of
the purchase, ownership and disposal of Notes for Italian resident and non-Italian resident beneficial owners
only and it is not intended to be, nor should it be constructed to be, legal or tax advice. The following summary
does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations which may be relevant to make a
decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences
applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers in securities or commodities) may be
subject to additional or special rules. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax
advisors concerning the overall tax consequences of their acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes and
receiving payments on interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes, including, in particular, the
effect of any state, regional and local tax laws. In any case, Italian legal concepts may not be identical to the
concepts described by the same English term as they exist under terms of different jurisdictions and any legal
concept expressed by using the relevant Italian term shall prevail over the corresponding concept expressed in
English terms.

**Tax Treatment of the Notes issued by the Issuer**

**_Tax Treatment of Interest_**

Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (“Decree No. 239”) sets out the applicable regime regarding
the tax treatment of interest, premium and other income (including the difference between the redemption
amount and the issue price and any relevant make-whole premium, hereinafter collectively referred to as
“Interest”) deriving from Notes falling within the category of bonds or similar securities (obbligazioni o titoli
_similari alle obbligazioni), pursuant to Article 44 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as_
amended and supplemented (“Decree No. 917”), according to which securities qualify as _titoli similari alle_
_obbligazioni (securities similar to bonds), if they:_

(i) incorporate an unconditional obligation to pay at maturity an amount not lower than their nominal
value or principal amount; and

(ii) attribute to the holders no direct or indirect right to control or participate in the management of the
issuer or in the management of the business in respect of which the notes have been issued; and


-----

(iii) not provide for a remuneration which is entirely linked to profits of the issuer, or other companies
belonging to the same group or to the business in respect of which the notes have been issued.

Decree No. 239 regulates the tax treatment of Interest related to bonds or similar securities to the extent they are,
_inter alia:_

(A) issued by companies whose shares are listed on a regulated market or on a multi-lateral trading
platform of EU Member States and of the States party to the EEA Agreement included in the list
provided for by Italian Ministerial Decree dated September 4, 1996, as amended from time to time, or,
as from the tax year in which the Ministerial Decree to be issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, let. c)
of Decree No. 239 is effective, included in the list therein provided (the “White List”); or

(B) listed on a regulated market or on a multilateral trading platform of EU Member States and of the
States party to the EEA Agreement included in the White List; or

(C) subscribed, transferred to and held by qualified investors (as defined under Article 100 of the Italian
Financial Services Act) only.

_Italian resident Noteholders_

_Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

Where the beneficial owner of the Notes (a “Noteholder”) is an Italian resident and is:

(a) an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected (unless he
has opted for the application of the risparmio gestito regime—see “Tax Treatment of Capital Gains” or
he has included the Notes in a long-term savings account—see “Long-term Savings Accounts”);

(b) a partnership (other than a societa` in nome collettivo or societa` in accomandita semplice or similar
partnership) or a _de facto_ partnership not carrying out commercial activities (società semplice) or
professional association;

(c) a non-commercial private or public institution, trusts not carrying out mainly or exclusively
commercial activities, the Italian State and public and territorial entities; or

(d) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation,

then Interest derived from the Notes, and accrued during the relevant holding period, is subject to a withholding
tax, referred to as “imposta sostitutiva,” levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or obtained upon
disposal of the Notes) unless the relevant Italian resident Noteholder holds the Notes in a discretionary
investment portfolio managed by an authorized intermediary and, under certain conditions, has validly opted for
the application of the “Risparmio gestito” regime provided for by Article 7 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 461
of November 21, 1997 (“Decree No. 461”). All the above categories are qualified as “net recipients.”

_Noteholders Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_

In the event that the Italian resident Noteholders described under clauses (a) and (c) above are engaged in an
entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax.
Interest will be subject to 26% _imposta sostitutiva_ on a provisional basis and will then be included in the
relevant Italian resident noteholder’s annual income tax return. As a consequence, Interest will be subject to the
ordinary income tax and imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a credit that can be offset against the income
tax due.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent establishment
in Italy of a foreign company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are deposited with an
Intermediary (as defined below), Interest from the Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva. They must,
however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and are therefore subject to the Italian
corporate tax (“IRES”) levied at the rate of 24% (although certain surcharges may apply) and, in certain
circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, the Italian regional tax on productive activities
(“IRAP”) generally levied at the base rate of 3.9% (even though regional surcharges may apply).


-----

_Long-term Savings Accounts_

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident
individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are effectively
connected or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and No. 103 of
February 10, 1996, may be exempt from any income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on Interest if the
Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine)
that meets the requirements set forth by Italian law, as amended and supplemented from time to time.

_Real Estate Investment Funds_

Payments of Interest deriving from the Notes made to Italian resident real estate collective investment funds
(“RE Funds”) and real estate Società di Investimento a Capitale Fisso (“RE SICAFs”) established pursuant to
Article 37 of the Legislative Decree of January 25, 1994, n. 58, as amended and supplemented, and article 14bis of Law No. 86 of January 25, 1994, provided that the Notes, together with the coupons relating thereto, are
timely deposited directly or indirectly with an Intermediary (as defined below) are subject neither to _imposta_
_sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at the level of the RE Funds or RE SICAFs. However, a withholding or_
substitute tax of 26% may apply, in certain circumstances, to income realized by unitholders or shareholders in
the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions and
depending on the status and percentage of participation held, income realized by RE Funds and RE SICAFs may
be attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands irrespective of its actual collection and in
proportion to the percentage of ownership of units/shares on a tax transparency basis.

_Funds and SICAV and Non-Real Estate SICAFs_

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is an open-ended or closed-ended collective investment fund other than a
RE Fund (a “Fund”) or Società di Investimento a Capitale Variabile (“SICAV”) or a Società di Investimento a
_Capitale Fisso other than a RE SICAF (“SICAF”) established in Italy and either (i) the Fund or SICAV or_
SICAF or (ii) its manager is subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes are deposited with
an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest accrued during the holding period on the Notes will not be subject
to _imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the management results of the Fund, SICAV or SICAF. The_
Fund, the SICAV or the SICAF will not be subject to taxation on such management results, but a withholding or
substitute tax of 26% may instead apply in certain circumstances to income realized by certain categories of
unitholders or shareholders (as applicable) in case of distribution, redemption or sales of the units or shares.

_Pension Funds_

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by article 17 of the
Legislative Decree of December 5, 2005, n. 252) and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined
below), Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to _imposta_
_sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the pension fund accrued at the end of the tax period (which will_
be subject to a 20% substitute tax on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax
year).

Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period) and several limitations (including amount and
composition of the capital investment), Interest relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of
the Pension Fund Tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account _(piano di risparmio a lungo_
_termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Italian law, as amended and supplemented from time to time._

_Enforcement of Imposta Sostitutiva_

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the _imposta sostitutiva_ is applied by Italian resident banks, _società di_
_intermediazione mobiliare_ (“SIM”), fiduciary companies, _società di gestione del Risparmio_ (“SGR”),
stockbrokers and other entities identified by a decree of the Ministry of Finance or Italian permanent
establishment of equivalent foreign entities (each, an “Intermediary”).

An Intermediary must:

(a) (i) be resident in Italy, or (ii) be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial
intermediary, or (iii) be an entity or a company not resident in Italy, acting through a system of


-----

centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Italian Tax Authorities having
appointed an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239; and

(b) intervene, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes.

For the purpose of the application of the _imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or_
other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in
a change in Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited.

Where the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by any
relevant Italian intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary) that intervenes in the
payment of paying Interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian
resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are
effectively connected are entitled to deduct the suffered imposta sostitutiva from income taxes due.

**Non-Italian Resident Noteholders**

Where the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident, payments of Interest in respect of the Notes issued by the Issuer
will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva at the rate of 26% provided that:

(a) the payments are made to non-Italian resident beneficial owners of Interest under the Notes with no
permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected; and

(b) such beneficial owners are residents, for tax purposes, in a country which allows for a satisfactory
exchange of information with Italy listed in the White List; and

(c) all the requirements and procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation
rules, as subsequently amended, in order to benefit from the exemption from _imposta sostitutiva_ are
timely met and complied with.

Decree No. 239 also provides for additional exemptions from the imposta sostitutiva for payments of Interest in
respect of the Notes made to:

(a) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered
into force in Italy;

(b) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a country which allows
for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy listed in the White List, and provided that they
timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate self-declaration of being an institutional investor;
or

(c) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must be the beneficial owners of the
payments of Interest (institutional investors not subject to tax are deemed to be beneficial owners of the
payments of Interest by operation of law) and must:

(a) deposit in due time, directly or indirectly, the Notes with a resident bank or a SIM or a permanent
establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or a SIM or with a non-Italian resident entity or
company participating in a centralized securities management system which is in contact, via computer,
with the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance having appointed an Italian representative for the
purposes of Decree No. 239 (Euroclear and Clearstream qualify as such latter kind of depositary); and

(b) file with the relevant depository, in due time, a statement of the relevant Noteholder (auto_certificazione), which remains valid until withdrawn or revoked, in which the Noteholder declares to be_
eligible to benefit from the applicable exemption from imposta sostitutiva. This statement, which is not
required for international bodies or entities set up in accordance with international agreements which
have entered into force in Italy nor in the case of foreign central banks or entities which manage, inter
_alia, the official reserves of a foreign State, must comply with the requirements set forth by the_
Ministerial Decree of December 12, 2001.


-----

Failure of a non-resident Noteholder to timely comply with the procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in
the relevant implementation rules will result in the application of imposta sostitutiva on Interest payments to a
non-Italian resident Noteholder.

Non-Italian resident Noteholders who are subject to the imposta sostitutiva might, nevertheless, be eligible for
full or partial relief under an applicable tax treaty between Italy and their country of residence, subject to timely
filing of required documentation provided by Measure of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency No.
2013/84404 of July 10, 2013.

**Payments Made by an Italian Resident Guarantor**

With respect to payments on the Notes made to Noteholders by an Italian resident Guarantor of the Notes, in
accordance with one interpretation of Italian tax law, any payment of liabilities equal to Interest and other
proceeds from the Notes (other than the repayment of principal) may be subject to a withholding tax at the rate
of 26% levied as a final or provisional tax (“a titolo d’imposta o a titolo di acconto”) depending on the “status”
and the tax residence of the beneficial owner of the Notes, pursuant to Presidential Decree of September 29,
1973, No. 600, as subsequently amended.

Double taxation treaties entered into by Italy may also apply, allowing for a lower (or, in certain cases, nil) rate
of withholding tax in case of payments to non-Italian resident Noteholders, subject to compliance with relevant
subjective and procedural requirements.

However, in accordance with an alternative interpretation, any such payment made by the Italian resident
Guarantor will be treated, in certain circumstances, as a payment by the Issuer and will thus be subject to the
Italian tax regime described above.

**Fungible Issues**

Pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 2 of Decree No. 239, where the relevant issuer issues a new tranche of notes
forming part of a single series with a previous tranche of notes, for the purposes of calculating the amount of
Interest subject to imposta sostitutiva, the issue price of the new tranche of notes will be deemed to be the same
amount as the issue price of the original tranche of notes subject to certain conditions. In particular, this rule
applies where (a) the new tranche of notes is issued within twelve months of the issue date of the previous
tranche of notes and (b) the difference between the issue price of the new tranche of notes and that of the
original tranche of notes does not exceed 1% of the nominal value of the notes multiplied by the number of
years of the duration of the notes.

**Tax Treatment of Capital Gains**

**_Italian Resident Noteholders_**

_Noteholders Not Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_

Where an Italian resident Noteholder (i) is an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the
Notes are connected, (ii) a non-commercial partnership (other than a società in nome collettivo or a società _in_
_accomandita semplice or a similar partnership) or a de facto partnership not carrying out commercial activities)_
or (iii) a non-commercial private or public institution, any capital gain realized by such Noteholder from the sale
or redemption of the Notes would be subject to a substitute tax provided for by Legislative Decree November
21, 1997, No. 461 as subsequently amended (the “Decree No. 461”), levied at the rate of 26%. Under certain
conditions and limitations, noteholders may set off any capital losses with their capital gains.

In respect of the application of the substitute tax on capital gains, taxpayers may opt for any of the three regimes
described below.

_Tax Declaration Regime_

Under the “tax declaration regime” (regime della dichiarazione), which is the default regime for Italian resident
Noteholders under (i) to (iii) above, the 26% substitute tax on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative
basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss of the same kind) realized by such Noteholders, during
any given tax year. The relevant Noteholders must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax year, net


-----

of any relevant incurred capital loss of the same kind, in their annual tax return and pay the substitute tax on
such gains of the same kind together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Capital losses in excess
of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four succeeding tax years.

_Risparmio Amministrato Regime_

As an alternative to the tax declaration regime, Noteholders under (i) to (iii) above may elect to pay the
substitute tax separately on capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (risparmio
_amministrato_ regime provided for by Article 6 of Decree No. 461). Such separate taxation of capital gains is
allowed subject to:

i. the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial intermediary (or
permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediaries); and

ii. a valid express election for the _risparmio amministrato_ regime being timely made in writing by the
relevant Noteholder.

The depository is responsible for accounting for the substitute tax in respect of capital gains realized on each
sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its
mandate), net of any incurred capital loss. The depository must also pay the substitute tax on capital gains to the
Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be
credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the _risparmio_
_amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting from a sale or redemption of the Notes may be deducted_
only from capital gains subsequently realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in
the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the _risparmio amministrato_ regime, the Noteholder is not
required to declare the capital gains in the annual tax return.

_Risparmio Gestito Regime_

In the _risparmio gestito_ regime, any capital gains realized by Noteholders under (i) to (iii) above who have
entrusted the management of their financial assets (including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary, will be
included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized,
at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Any
depreciation of the managed assets accrued at the tax year end may be carried forward against any increase in
value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. The Noteholder is not required to
declare the capital gains realized in its annual tax return.

Subject to certain limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment) and requirements
(including a minimum holding period), capital gains in respect of Notes realized upon sale, transfer or
redemption by Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or
social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103
of February 10, 1996 may be exempt from any income taxation, including the 26% substitute tax on capital
gains, if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a
_lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Italian law as amended and supplemented from time to_
time.

_Noteholders Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_

Any capital gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be treated as part of taxable income
(and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of the
production for IRAP purposes) if realized by (i) an Italian company, or a similar commercial entity; (ii) an
Italian resident commercial partnership; (iii) an Italian permanent establishment of foreign entities to which the
Notes are effectively connected; or, (iv) an Italian resident individual engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to
which the Notes are connected.

_RE Funds and RE SICAF_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is an Italian RE Fund or an Italian RE SICAF are exempt from
any income tax at the level of the RE Fund or RE SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax may apply
in certain circumstances at the rate of 26% to income realized by unitholders or shareholders of the Re Fund/RE


-----

SICAF upon distributions made by Italian RE Funds/RE SICAF or upon redemption or disposal of the units or
the shares (as applicable).

Subject to certain conditions and depending on the status and percentage of participation held, income realized
by RE Funds and RE SICAFs may be attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands,
irrespective of its actual collection and in proportion to the percentage of ownership of units on a tax
transparency basis.

_Funds, SICAV and SICAF_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is a Fund or a SICAV or a SICAF will be included in the result
of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period which is exempt from any income tax. A
26% withholding tax may apply in certain circumstances, to distributions by th Fund or SICAF or SICAV or
received by certain categories of unitholders or shareholders upon redemption or disposal or sale of the units or
the shares (as applicable).

_Pension Funds_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by
Article 17 of Legislative Decree of December 5, 2005, n. 252) will be included in the result of the relevant
portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to a 20% substitute tax. Subject to certain
conditions and requirements (including minimum holding period requirement) and several limitations (including
amount and composition of the capital investment), income relating to the Notes may be excluded from the
taxable base of the Pension Fund Tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano
_individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Italian law, as amended and_
supplemented from time to time.

_Non-Italian Resident Noteholders_

A 26% final substitute tax on capital gains may be payable on capital gains realized upon the sale, transfer or
redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in
Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy.

However, pursuant to Article 23, paragraph 1, let. f), of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-Italian
resident Noteholders, without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected,
from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets in Italy
or abroad are not subject to the substitute tax on capital gains, subject to timely filling of required
documentation (in particular, a self-declaration that the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes) with
Italian qualified intermediaries (or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) with which the
Notes are deposited, even if the Notes are held in Italy and regardless of the provisions set forth by any
applicable double tax treaty. Italian tax authorities have clarified (Italian Revenue Agency Circular Letter No.
32 of December 23, 2020) that the notion of multilateral trading facility (MTF) under EU Directive 2014/65/CE
(so called MiFID II) can be assimilated to that of “regulated market” for income tax purposes; conversely,
organized trading facilities (OTF), not falling in the definition of MTF under MiFID II, cannot be assimilated to
“regulated market” for income tax purposes.

Pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 5 of Decree No. 461, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders
from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and held in Italy, even if not traded on
regulated markets, are not subject to the substitute tax on capital gains, provided that the effective beneficiary is:

(a) resident, for tax purposes, in a State, in a country which recognizes the Italian fiscal authorities’ right to
an adequate exchange of information, included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status
of a taxpayer in its own country of establishment, and does not have a permanent establishment in Italy
to which the Notes are effectively connected;

(b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered
into force in Italy;


-----

(c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a country which is
listed in the White List, and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate
self-declaration of being an institutional investor; or

(d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the
Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to
the risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on
capital gains will apply upon condition that they file in time with the authorized financial intermediary an
appropriate self-declaration – complying with the requirements set forth by the Ministerial Decree of December
12, 2001 – stating that they are resident, for tax purposes, in a country which is listed in the White List.

If none of the above conditions above is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the
sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets may be
subject to the substitute tax at the current rate of 26%. However, non-Italian resident Noteholders might benefit
from an applicable tax treaty with Italy providing that capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the
Notes are to be taxed only in the tax residence country of the recipient.

Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the
Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to
the risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on
capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-Italian residents file in time with the authorized financial
intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the competent tax
authorities of their country of residence.

The _risparmio amministrato_ regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian resident
persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of
foreign intermediary), but non-Italian resident Noteholders retain the right to waive this regime.

**Tax Reform on Financial Income**

The Italian legislator has recently demanded the Italian Government to enact one or more Legislative Decrees in
order to review and systematize the Italian tax framework in accordance with the criteria and guidelines
included in the delegation of powers provided for under Law of August 9, 2023, No. 111 (“Law No.
**111/2023”). The demanded Legislative Decrees shall be issued (save for certain exceptions) within 24 months**
from the date of the entry into force of Law No. 111/2023 (that is August 29, 2023) and may be amended and/or
supplemented within 24 months from that deadline.

Law No. 111/2023 laid down, _inter alia, certain criteria for the reform of the taxation of income having a_
financial nature attributable to individuals (Article 5(1)(d)), which include: (i) the harmonization of the tax
provisions aimed at the creation of a single omni-comprehensive category including all the types of income
having a financial nature; (ii) the determination of the financial income based on the “cash principle” (principio
_di cassa); (iii) the application of a substitutive tax on the overall net result of financial income realized in a_
relevant calendar year, determined by deducting negative financial income from positive financial income, with
the possibility to carry forward negative net results; (iv) the obligation to declare in a tax return the financial
income, which may be derogated on an optional basis by the taxpayer where such income is realized through the
intervention of authorised intermediaries entrusted with the application of an income taxation with simplified
modalities; (v) the obligation upon the subjects involved in the collection of the financial income, for which the
taxpayer has not opted for the optional regime under (iv) above, to disclose such financial income to the Italian
tax authorities; and (vi) the application of a substitute tax with a privileged rate on financial income realized by
social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and No. 103 of February 10,
1996.

To date, the Legislative Decree to be issued to enact the principles listed above has not been adopted yet. The
precise nature, extent, and impact of these amendments cannot therefore be quantified or foreseen with certainty
at this stage. The information provided in this Offering Memorandum may not reflect the future tax landscape
accurately. Prospective Noteholders shall consult their own tax advisors in relation to the monitoring of the
expected tax reform and the overall tax consequences deriving therefrom.

**Italian Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax**

Pursuant to Law No. 346 of October 31, 1990 and No. 286 of November 24, 2006, as subsequently amended,
transfers of Notes by reason of gift, donation or succession of Italian residents and of non-Italian residents, but
in such latter case limited to assets held within the Italian territory (which, for presumption of law, includes
bonds issued by Italian resident issuers) are subject to Italian gift and inheritance tax as follows:

(a) 4% for transfers in favor of the spouse and direct descendants or direct ancestors exceeding, for each
beneficiary, a threshold of €1.0 million;

(b) 6% for transfers in favor of siblings exceeding, for each beneficiary, a threshold of €0.1 million;

(c) 6% for transfers in favor of relatives up to the fourth degree and to all relatives in law in direct line and
to other relatives in law up to the third degree, on the entire value of the inheritance or the gift; and

(d) 8% for transfers in favor of any other person or entity, on the entire value of the inheritance or the gift.

If the heir/heiress and/or the donee is a person with a severe disability pursuant to Law n. 104 of February 5,
1992, inheritance tax or gift tax is applied to the extent that the value of the inheritance or gift exceeds €1.5
million.

With respect to Notes listed on a regulated market, the relevant value for inheritance and gift tax purposes is the
average stock exchange price of the last quarter preceding the date of the succession or of the gift (including any
accrued interest). With respect to unlisted Notes, the value for inheritance tax and gift tax purposes is generally
determined by reference to the value of listed debt securities having similar features or based on certain
elements as presented in the Italian tax law.

The transfer of financial instruments as a result of death is exempt from inheritance tax when such financial
instruments are included in a long-term saving account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that
meets the requirements set forth in Italian law, as amended and supplemented from time to time.

Moreover, an anti-avoidance rule is provided in the case of a gift of assets, such as the Notes, whose sale for
consideration would give rise to capital gains to be subject to the substitute tax provided for by Decree No. 461,
as subsequently amended. In particular, if the donee sells the securities for consideration within five years from
their receipt as a gift, the latter is required to pay the relevant substitute tax as if the gift had never taken place.

**Stamp Taxes and Duties**

According to Article 13, paragraph 2-ter of the tariff Part I attached to Presidential Decree No. 642 of October
26, 1972, as amended and supplemented, a proportional stamp duty applies on a yearly basis at the rate of 0.20%
on communications and reports that Italian financial intermediaries periodically send to their clients in relation
to the financial products that are deposited with such intermediaries (the level of tax being determined in
proportion to the period of ownership). The Notes are included in the definition of financial products for these
purposes. Communications and reports are deemed to be sent at least once a year even if the Italian financial
intermediary is under no obligation to either draft or send such communications and reports. In this case, the
stamp duty is to be applied on December 31 of each year or in any case at the end of the relationship with the
client. At any rate, where no specific exemption applies, a minimum stamp tax of Euro 34.20 is due on a yearly
basis. The stamp duty applies on the market value or—in the absence of a market value—on the nominal value
or the redemption amount of any financial product or financial instruments or in the case that the nominal value
or redemption values cannot be determined, on the purchase value of any financial asset (including the Notes)
resulting from any periodic reporting communication issued by the Italian financial intermediary with which the
Notes are deposited (the tax being determined in proportion to the reporting period).

Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the Italian Ministry of Economy on
May 24, 2012, the stamp duty applies to any investor who is a client (as defined in the regulations issued by the
Bank of Italy) of an entity that exercises in any form a banking, financial or insurance activity within the Italian
territory. The stamp duty cannot exceed €14,000 per year if the Notes are held by noteholders other than
individuals. Stamp duty applies both to Italian resident noteholders and to non-Italian resident noteholders, to
the extent that the Notes are held with an Italian-based financial intermediary (and not directly held by the


-----

noteholders outside Italy, in which case Italian wealth tax (see below under “Wealth Tax”) applies to Italian
resident Noteholders only).

**Wealth Tax**

In accordance with Article 19 of Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011, converted with amendments by Law No.
214 of December 22, 2011, individuals, certain non-commercial entities, including trusts and foundations, and
so called società semplici (and similar partnerships pursuant to Article 5 of Decree No. 917), resident in Italy for
tax purposes holding financial assets— including the Notes—outside Italy are required to declare in its own
annual tax return and pay a wealth tax (“IVAFE”) at the rate of 0.20% (starting from January 1, 2024, the
wealth tax applies at a rate of 0.40% if the Notes are held in a State or territory with a privileged tax regime as
listed in the Italian Ministerial Decree dated May 4, 1999, pursuant to the provisions of Law No. 213/2023). The
tax is determined in proportion to the period of ownership. The wealth tax applies on the market value at the end
of the relevant year (or at the end of the holding period) or, in the absence of market value, on the nominal value
or redemption value of such financial assets held outside Italy or in the case that the nominal value or
redemption values cannot be determined, on the purchase value of any financial asset. Taxpayers are permitted
to deduct from the wealth tax a tax credit equal to any equivalent wealth tax legitimately paid in the State where
the financial assets are held (up to the amount of IVAFE due).

Pursuant to the provision of Article 134 of Law Decree No. 34 of May 19, 2020, the wealth tax cannot exceed
€14,000 per year for taxpayers different from individuals.

**Transfer tax**

Contracts relating to the transfer of securities are subject to the registration tax as follows:

(a) public deeds and notarized deeds (atti pubblici e scritture private autenticate) are subject to fixed
registration tax at rate of €200.00, and

(b) private deeds (scritture private non autenticate) are subject to fixed registration tax of €200.00
applicable only in case of use (caso d’uso), reference in a subsequent registered deed (enunciazione) or
voluntary registration (volontaria registrazione).

**EU Savings Tax Directive and Implementation of the Automatic Exchange of Information in Italy**

On November 10, 2015, the Council of the European Union approved the Council Directive 2015/2060/EU
(published in the Official Journal of the EU on November 18, 2015) which has repealed the Council Directive
2003/48/EU (the “EU Savings Tax Directive”) from January 1. 2016 in the case of all Member States other
than Austria and from January 1, 2017 in the case of Austria. This was intended to prevent overlap between the
EU Savings Tax Directive and the new automatic exchange of information regime to be implemented under
Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council
Directive 2014/107/EU). The new regime under Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is in accordance
with the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development in July 2014. Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is generally broader in scope than the
EU Saving Tax Directive, although it does not impose withholding taxes.

Italy has enacted Italian Law No. 95 of June 18, 2015 (“Law 95/2015”), implementing the CRS (and the
amended EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation) Italian Ministerial Decree dated December 28, 2015,
which has entered into force on January 1, 2016, has implemented Law 95/2015 and has provided for the
exchange of information starting from the calendar year 2016.

In the event that holders of the Notes hold the Notes through an Italian financial institution (as defined in the
Italian Ministerial Decree of December 28, 2015 implementing Law 95/2015), they may be required to provide
additional information to such financial institution to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Italian
implementation of the CRS.

**Italian Financial Transactions Tax**

Pursuant to Law No. 228 of December 24, 2012, Italian financial transaction tax (“FTT”) applies to (a) transfer
of ownership of shares and other participating securities issued by Italian resident companies or of financial


-----

instruments representing the said shares and/or participating securities (irrespective of whether issued by Italian
resident issuers or not) (the “Relevant Securities”), (b) transactions on financial derivatives (i) the main
underlying assets of which are the Relevant Securities, or (ii) whose value depends mainly on one or more
Relevant Securities, as well as to (c) any transaction on certain securities (i) which allow to mainly purchase or
sell one or more Relevant Securities or (ii) implying a cash payment determined with main reference to one or
more Relevant Securities.

Securities could be included in the scope of application of the FTT if they meet the requirements set out above.
On the other hand, securities falling within the category of bonds (obbligazioni), such as the Notes, don’t meet
the requirements set out above and, consequently, are not included in the scope of the FTT.

Prospective holders of the Notes are strongly advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
possible application of financial transaction tax in countries other than Italy.

**Italian Tax Monitoring Obligations**

Italian resident individuals (and certain other Italian resident entities) are required, in certain circumstances, to
report in their yearly income tax return (or, in case the income tax return is not due, in a proper form that must
be filed within the same time as prescribed for the income tax return), according to Legislative Decree No. 167
of June 28, 1990, converted with amendments into law by Law No. 227 of August 4, 1990, as amended, for tax
monitoring purposes, the amount of securities, including notes, held abroad (or beneficially owned abroad under
Italian anti- money laundering provisions). This also applies in the case that at the end of the tax year, securities
are no longer held by the above Italian resident individuals and entities.

However, the above reporting obligation is not required where (i) the securities are deposited for management
with qualified Italian financial intermediaries and with respect to contracts entered into through their
intervention, provided that the same intermediaries apply a withholding tax or imposta sostitutiva on any income
derived from the securities or (ii) one of such intermediaries intervenes, also as a counterpart, in their transfer,
provided that income deriving from such financial assets has been subject to the applicable withholding tax or
substitute tax by the same intermediaries or (iii) the foreign financial investments are only composed by deposits
and/or bank accounts having an aggregate value not exceeding an €15,000.00 threshold throughout the year.

The requirement applies also where the persons above, being not the direct holder of the financial instruments,
are the beneficial owner of the instrument.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S.
Holder or Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below) and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws
other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.
This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative
pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case as of the date hereof. These
authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation
may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes. We have not sought
and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the
IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221
of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons
purchasing the Notes for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section
1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes of the relevant series is sold to
the public for cash). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a
holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment
income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including,
without limitation:


-----

- U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

- U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents living abroad

- persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;

- tax consequences to holders who elect to treat all interest on the Notes as OID;

- U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

- U.S. Holders holding Notes in connection with a trade or business conducted outside the United States;

- persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a
conversion transaction or other integrated investment;

- persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to
the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement;

- banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;

- real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;

- brokers, dealers or traders in securities;

- “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

- S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (and investors therein);

- tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; and

- persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note who or that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

- an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

- a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and nor or more
U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election
in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Notes that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership (or a
disregarded entity owned by a U.S. Holder). If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status
of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly,
partnerships holding the Notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding
the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.

**THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.**
**INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE**
**APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR**


-----

**SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND**
**DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS**
**(INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR**
**NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.**

**_Effect of the IPO Debt Pushdown Provisions_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under “Description of the
_Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown,” such change in the Issuer could result in a deemed exchange of the Notes for_
“new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders generally would recognize any
gain on such exchange (although any loss could be disallowed), and the “new” Notes could be treated as issued
with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see for example, “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of
_the Notes— Withholding Taxes,” “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes_
_—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”), the Issuer may be obligated to redeem the Notes for_
an amount in excess of their adjusted issue price, or may be obligated to make certain payments on the Notes in
excess of stated principal and interest. The Issuer believes that the Notes should not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments due to the possibility of such a redemption occurring or such excess payments being
made. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder discloses in the proper manner
to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes
were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. Holders could be required to accrue interest income
at a rate different than their yield to maturity and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain
recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note. The balance of
this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. Holders
are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the Notes of the contingent payment
debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of stated interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes
and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S.
Holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S.
Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a
payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S.
dollar value of the foreign currency interest payment (determined based on the spot rate on the date such
payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash
method U.S. Holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such stated interest,
but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency so
received.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who
otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in foreign currency that has accrued with
respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such Euro denominated accrued stated
interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual
period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for
the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate such
accrued stated interest income into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest
accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the spot rate of exchange
on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five Business Days
of the date of receipt of the accrued stated interest, a U.S. Holder that has made the election described in the
prior sentence may translate such interest using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the stated


-----

interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. Holder and may not be
changed without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize
exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued stated interest income on the date such interest is received. The
amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of
the Euro payment received (determined based on the spot rate on the date such stated interest is received) in
respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income that has accrued during
such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars
at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated,
for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest
income or expense.

**_Original issue discount_**

If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount not less
than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.25% of the stated principal amount multiplied by the
number of complete years to maturity), the Notes will be treated as issued with OID. In such event, a U.S.
Holder will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant
yield to maturity basis) in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income, regardless of the U.S.
Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the amount of OID that a U.S. Holder must include in
income if you own a Note issued with OID is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for
each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder held such Note
(“accrued OID”). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata
portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The “accrual period” for a Note may be of any length and
may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and
each scheduled payment of principal or stated interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual
period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of:

    - the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the accrual period multiplied by its yield to
maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly
adjusted for the length of the accrual period, over

    - the aggregate of all stated interest allocable to the accrual period.

OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount of the Note and the
adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating OID for
an initial short accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period is
equal to its issue price, increased by any accrued OID for each prior accrual period. Under these rules, a U.S.
Holder will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.

Since the Floating Rate Notes bear a floating rate of stated interest, both the “yield to maturity” and the amount
of stated interest in each accrual period will be determined, solely for purposes of calculating the accrual of
OID, as though the Floating Rate Senior Secured Note will bear stated interest in all periods at a fixed rate
generally equal to the rate that would be applicable to stated interest payments on such Floating Rate Senior
Secured Note on its date of issue. To the extent the stated interest actually accrued or paid during an accrual
period exceeds (or is less than) the stated interest to be accrued or paid during the accrual period based on such
fixed rate on the date of issue, such difference will be accounted for tax purposes as an adjustment to stated
interest and will have no effect on the computation of OID.

OID, if any, will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars, in
accordance with either of the two alternative methods as discussed for stated interest income accrued by a U.S.
Holder on the accrual basis, as described above under “—Payments of stated interest.” A U.S. Holder will
recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds
that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any,
between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (determined by translating the euros received at the
spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID (determined in the


-----

same manner as for accrued interest), but subject to the discussion under “—Sale, exchange, retirement,
_redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes” and the limitation on exchange gain on disposition described_
therein. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed:

    - first, as payments of stated interest payable on the Note,

    - second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered
made for the earliest accrual periods first, and

    - third, as the receipt of principal.

Any such exchange gain or loss generally will be treated, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S.
source ordinary income or loss, and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

The rules regarding OID are complex. Accordingly, prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors
regarding the application of the rules described above.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

Stated interest income and OID on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be
considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S.
federal income tax laws. Any non-refundable non-U.S. withholding tax (at a rate not exceeding any applicable
tax treaty rate) may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, subject to applicable complex limitations (including, but not limited to, holding period and
at risk rules). There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits.
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding
taxes in their particular circumstances.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition
(less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as stated interest income
as discussed above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. Holder) and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be the cost of such Note to such U.S. Holder,
increased by any OID previously included in income. The cost of a Note purchased with Euro will generally be
the U.S. dollar value of the Euro purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the
applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. Holder is either a
cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S.
Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot
rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase.

If a U.S. Holder receives Euro on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such Euro translated at the spot
rate on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities
market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar
value of such Euro by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. The
special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the purchase and disposition of Notes traded
on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder
and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If the Notes are not traded on an established securities
market (or the relevant holder does not make the special settlement date election) an accrual basis U.S. Holder
will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the
disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary
income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note
that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note


-----

generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or
expense. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount
of a Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s foreign
currency purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date principal is received from the Issuer
or the U.S. Holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s foreign currency
purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Note. In
addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated
interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “Payments of stated interest.” However, upon a sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize any
exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued interest or OID) only to the extent of total gain or loss
realized by such U.S. Holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note in excess of exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source gain or loss
and generally will be capital gain or loss. The rules governing foreign tax credits are very complex, and the
ability to obtain credits for any non-U.S. taxes imposed on disposition gains is subject to very significant
limitations. Accordingly, prospective purchasers should consult their own tax advisers regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences if any non-U.S. taxes are imposed on disposition gains in their particular
circumstances, including creditability, deductibility, determination of amount realized and any applicable
limitations, as well as their ability to establish an exemption from, or obtain a refund of, such non-U.S. taxes
under an applicable tax treaty or non-U.S. law.

Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for
more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency
with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign
currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to
losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in
respect of (or used to acquire) a foreign currency note. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to
determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

U.S. Holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in
excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an
information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S. Holder does not
file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations
on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not
close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. The Notes generally will
constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in
an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an
individual for purposes of these rules.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally should not be subject to
U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any payments on the Notes and gain from the sale, redemption or
other disposition of the Notes unless: (i) that payment and/or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by
that Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the U.S.; (ii) in the case of any gain realized on the sale or
exchange of a Note by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, that Holder is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in


-----

the taxable year of the sale, exchange or retirement and certain other conditions are met; or (iii) the Non-U.S.
Holder is subject to tax pursuant to provisions of the Code applicable to certain expatriates.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on the Notes and to the
proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. Holder
unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient, and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption.
Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification
number or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to comply with the
applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. In general, payments of principal and interest in
respect of, and the proceeds from sales of, the Notes, payable to a Non-U.S. Holder by a U.S. or U.S.-connected
paying agent or other U.S. or U.S.-connected intermediary will not be subject to backup withholding tax and
information reporting requirements if appropriate certification (IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or other
appropriate form) is provided by the Non-U.S. Holder to the payor and the payor does not have actual
knowledge that the certificate is false.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may
be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to be
entered into in connection with the Notes, the Issuer has agreed to sell the Notes to the Initial Purchasers and the
Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase
all the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes
which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other
Initial Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After
the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by
the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their
affiliates.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with
the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the Offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement will provide that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited
exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued by the
Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes for a period of 60 days after the Issue
Date.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have
agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” within
the meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in
compliance with Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be
made by broker- dealers who are registered as such under the U.S. Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the
commencement of this Offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not it
is participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer
or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the U.S.
Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the
Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of
Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted
by guidelines promulgated by the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

Funds advised by CVC that indirectly own an equity interest in the Issuer are affiliates of CVC Capital Markets
S.à r.l., which is acting as an Initial Purchaser in connection with the offering of the Notes.

Funds or entities affiliated with CVC may purchase Notes in the Offering at a purchase price per Note equal to
the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum on the Issue Date or in the future, and
in the case of investment funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940
**Act”), subject to compliance with the 1940 Act. The Purchase Agreement will not restrict the ability of funds**
and affiliates of the principal shareholders to buy or sell Notes on the Issue Date or in the future and, as a result,
funds and affiliates of our principal shareholders may buy or sell the Notes on the Issue Date or, may trade at
any time and from time to time in the Notes or other series of debt issued by the Issuer, by means other than a
redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases and sales, negotiated transactions or otherwise, and


-----

such purchases or sales may be at prices below par. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually
or in the aggregate, may be material, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of the Notes in open
market transactions at any time following the consummation of the offering of the Notes.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Each Initial Purchaser has, severally and not jointly, represented and agreed that it will not offer, sell or
otherwise make available any Notes to any “retail investor” in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this
provision:

(a) the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

- a retail client as defined in in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;

- a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under
the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

- not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

(b) the expression an “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to
purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

Each Initial Purchaser has, severally and not jointly, represented and agreed that it will not offer, sell or
otherwise make available any Notes to any “retail investor” in the European Economic Area. For the purposes
of this provision:

(a) the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

- a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;

- a customer, with respect to the European Economic Area, within the meaning of the Insurance
Distribution Directive where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

- not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

(b) the expression an “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to
purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for
such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The
target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local
regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any distributor should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for


-----

undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process in the United Kingdom, the target
market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion
that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the COBS, and professional
clients as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes
(by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom, by the
Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements
in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction
where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the
distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of,
directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or
disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors
of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made to list
the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit to trading on the Euro MTF
Market in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. We cannot assure you
that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified
on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be     Business Days (as such term is used for
purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement
cycle is being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary
market generally are required to settle in two Business Days (until the end of the period of transition to a
settlement cycle of T+1 on May 28, 2024) unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next
succeeding     Business Days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such
trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their
own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the
price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the Offering,
creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the
syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and
purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose
penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market
levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may
end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets
for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit
_your ability to sell the Notes.” These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause_
the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These
transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is


-----

made and, if begun, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Manager. If these
activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the
Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the overthe-counter market or otherwise.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition,
neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Initial Purchasers will engage in
these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. See
“Risk Factors—An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the
_Notes.”_

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates or other parties involved in the Acquisition from time to time have
provided in the past, are currently providing, or may in the future provide, investment banking, financial
advisory, commercial banking, various lending, hedging, cash management, guarantee or other banking or
budgeting services to us and our affiliates under bilateral agreements or local facilities in the ordinary course of
business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers
or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, the Initial Purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates may be lenders, managers and/or agents under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Initial
Purchasers have also committed to provide bridge financing in connection with the financing of the Acquisition
in the event the Offering is not consummated. In connection with these financings, the Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates have received and will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such
capacities.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates,
including the Existing Notes and the Notes. If the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have a lending
relationship with the Issuer, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their
customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in the Issuer’s securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such
short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers
and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research
views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they
acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments.


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of the Notes_
_offered hereby._

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or the securities laws of any
state of the United States or any other jurisdiction, and, therefore unless so registered, may not be offered or sold
in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the
U.S. Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of such state or other jurisdiction.
Accordingly, the Issuer is offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

(a) in the United States, to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as defined in
Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

(b) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S
and only to investors who, if resident in a Member State of the EEA or the UK, are not retail investors,
defined as a person who is one (or more) of:

i. a retail client, (with respect to the European Economic Area, as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”) and, with respect to the
United Kingdom, as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”));

ii. a customer, with respect to the European Economic Area, within the meaning of Directive
2016/97/EU, as amended (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II
and, with respect to the United Kingdom, within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA
and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

iii. not a qualified investor (with respect to the European Economic Area, as defined in
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, as amended (the “Prospectus Regulation”) and with respect to
the United Kingdom, as defined in the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA).

We use the terms “offshore transaction”, “U.S. persons” and “United States” with the meanings given to
them in Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the Issue Date, an offer or sale
of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule
144A or another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and
agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes are being offered for resale in a transaction not
involving a public offering in the United States within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act, that the
Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and, unless so registered,
may not be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred in the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act), except in
compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each
case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set out in paragraphs (5) and (6) below.

(2) It is neither the Issuer’s “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 of the U.S. Securities Act), nor acting on its
behalf and that either:


-----

(a) it is a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A and is aware that any sale of these Notes to it
will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition of Notes will be for its own
account or for the account of another QIB; or

(b) (i) it is a non-U.S. person purchasing the Notes outside the United States in an offshore
transaction in accordance with Regulation S; and

(ii) if resident in a Member State of the EEA or the UK, it is not a retail investor (as
defined above).

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing any of
them, has made any representation to it with respect to the Issuer and its subsidiaries or the offer or sale
of any of the Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which
Offering Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment
decision with respect to the Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person
representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of this Offering Memorandum. It has had access to such financial and other information
concerning the Issuer and its subsidiaries and the Notes that it deems necessary in connection with its
decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request
information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities
laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such
investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to
resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration
available under the U.S. Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes,
and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell
or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is,
in the case of the Rule 144A Notes, one year after the later of the original issue date of such Notes, the
original issue date of any additional Notes and the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates
were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) or, in the case of the Regulation S Notes, 40
days after the later of the original issue date of such Notes (or, if later, the issue date of any additional
Notes) and the last date on which such Notes were first offered to persons other than distributors (as
defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S), only (i) to the Issuer or a guarantor (if any); (ii) pursuant to a
registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act; (iii) for so long as
the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that
purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is
being made in reliance on Rule 144A; (iv) in offers and sales that occur outside the United States to
non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S; or (v) pursuant to any other
available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the
foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such
investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any
applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the
Issuer and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) above to
require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and other information satisfactory to each of
them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer is completed and
delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply
subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY NOTES GUARANTEES AND**
**THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of any Notes Guarantees_
_and the security interests being provided for the Notes, and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations_
_in Italy. The description below is only a summary, and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all the_
_limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes or any Notes_
_Guarantees or security interests being provided for the Notes. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult_
_their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Italy, which is a member state of the European Union (a “Member
**State”).**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the
European Union, other than Denmark, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company (subject to certain exceptions) is the court of the Member State (other than
Denmark) in which the relevant company’s centre of main interests (“COMI”) (as that term is used in Article
3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) is situated.

COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time, but is determined for the purposes of decided
which court has competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency
petition: moreover, the determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of
the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1), second sentence, of the
Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” Under Article 3(1)
of the Recast Insolvency Regulation there is, in most cases, a rebuttable presumption that a corporate debtor has
its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary. The presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State
within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the
Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be
rebutted: for instance, where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that
of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a
manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision
and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that
courts may take into consideration when determining the centre of main interests of a debtor can include where
board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head
office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established.

If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member
State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that Member State have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency
proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Recast Insolvency Regulation and accordingly a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the
Recast Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the Recast
Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although
secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member
State (other than Denmark).

If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is in a Member State
(other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member
State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial
insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (as defined in Article
2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings
may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance
of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary
proceedings that are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is
defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period


-----

prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means
and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings
in another Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such
Member State in the three month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other
Member State are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.
Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of main interests have not yet
been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other
than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be
commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under the conditions
laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by
(a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within
the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public
authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated,
has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened,
territorial insolvency proceedings usually become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether
the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will,
subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court
that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary
insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency
practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings
may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than
Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to
certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been
commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there
further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has
assets).

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency
Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a
group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings
may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the
group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the
group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency
practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the
Issuer.

It remains to be seen what impact the recent vote by the United Kingdom to leave the EU will have on the
regulatory environment in the EU and the United Kingdom, and on the applicability of EU law in the United
Kingdom. In a “no-deal Brexit” scenario in particular, it may be harder for English office holders and English
restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and to effectively deal with assets
located in those other Member States. Much depends upon the private international rules in the particular
Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In
particular, in cases where the appointment of an English office holder has been made in reliance on an English
domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the
relevant Member State.

**Italy**

**Limitations on Granting Security Interests and Guarantees under Italian Law**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a
guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its bylaws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization
and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the
context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also
be triggered.

**_Corporate Benefit_**

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must
receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such
company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and
determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors
and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant
company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of
the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for
downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial
obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and
effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure
financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an
entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for
the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may
derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of
an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples
may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other
members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely
untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such
transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk
assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the
direct or indirect economic benefit to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a
security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company _ultra vires_ and potentially affected by a
conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the
subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian
grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall
within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of
corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately
exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such
improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian
company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known
by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees
or security interests granted by Italian companies.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within
the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act, whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and
authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among
others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree
No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the
issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is
part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling
and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies
which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant


-----

guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees
would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

**_Financial Assistance_**

In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which
would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of
the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions (it being understood that no exceptions
are provided for limited liability companies pursuant to Article 2474 of the Italian Civil Code), it is unlawful for
a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support
the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or
indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for
the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would
also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach
of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best
interests of the company.

In light of the above, no Italian company shall undertake to guarantee financial indebtedness which was
incurred, in full or in part, to purchase its shares and which would therefore constitute the provision of financial
assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code
and/or any other law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by Italian courts unless in compliance
with the limitations and exceptions set forth therein. See “—Whitewash Procedure” below and “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Collateral, the Upstream_
_Guarantee and any future guarantees or security of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity_
_and enforceability.”_

**_Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_**

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is issued to
guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such
maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee
deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture).

**_Limitations to the Notes Guarantees and Collateral_**

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on corporate benefit and financial assistance, the
maximum amount that any Guarantor and/or security provider incorporated under the laws of Italy (if any) (the
“Italian Guarantor”) may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the relevant Notes
Guarantee and/or security provider under the relevant security interest will be subject to limitations. By virtue of
these limitations, the obligations of a Guarantor and/or security provider incorporated under the laws of Italy
under its Notes Guarantee and/or security interest may be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Notes, or such Guarantor and/or security provider may have effectively no obligation under its Notes
Guarantee and/or security interest.

In particular, as regards any Italian Guarantor, given the above limitations in relation to Italian financial
assistance law and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) in order to comply with the provisions of the Italian law in relation to financial assistance (including
article 2358 and/or article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code), the Notes Guarantee and
security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not include and/or extend to any
amounts of the Notes the purpose or the actual use of which is to finance, directly or indirectly, the
acquisition of the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) and/or
the subscription of any shares or quota in the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect
holding companies) (or to refinance, directly or indirectly, any existing indebtedness incurred for such
purposes) and/or the payment of any fees, costs and expenses, stamp, registration or other taxes in
connection therewith;


-----

(ii) the Notes Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed at
any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or other
financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity
contributions) advanced or made available from time to time to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its
direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1 and 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by
the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Acquisition Closing Date, and
outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Notes Guarantee, in each case net of any
proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility
and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor;
provided further that no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor and/or security provider in
respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that it is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse
or subrogation (regresso or _surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian_
Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or as a result of the enforcement of any security
interests granted by it;

(iii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by any Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with
article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes;

(iv) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian
Guarantor will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of
the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the relevant Italian
Guarantor at that time;

(v) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of Civil
Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of such Guarantor under its Notes
Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the
Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions
set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Banking Act,
respectively.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations
as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon
enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will rateably concur and not cumulate
with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor
pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any
guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the
Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue
of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian
Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the
Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating
future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating
to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and
shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount
of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant
Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit
support as described above.

In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by an
Italian Guarantor to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum
amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in
the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such
determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed
disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void.
In addition, and without prejudice to the above, the amount guaranteed by the Upstream Guarantee granted by
the Target shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the lower of:


-----

  - the amount of distributable profits and available reserves that will be set aside for such purposes by the
Target in connection with the Whitewash Procedure; and

  - the aggregate principal amount of as a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect
to, amongst others, financial assistance and corporate benefit as indicated below in respect of any
Italian Guarantor.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests shall be distributed among the
guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover
limited amounts under the relevant Notes Guarantees and security. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Whitewash Procedure_**

In order to provide the Upstream Guarantee within 120 days following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target
will be required to carry out a Whitewash Procedure. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the validity
and enforceability of guarantees and/or security granted by virtue of the Whitewash Procedure have not been
tested before the Italian courts. Pursuant to the Italian Civil Code, the Whitewash Procedure must be carried out
as follows: (i) the credit support to be granted by the Target under its Upstream Guarantee must be authorized at
an extraordinary shareholders meeting of the Target; and (ii) the board of directors of the Target must prepare a
written report (to be deposited at the registered office of the Target 30 days prior to the relevant extraordinary
shareholders’ meeting) indicating the legal and economic features of the transaction, describing the relevant
terms and conditions, highlighting the reasons and the business objectives for providing its Upstream Guarantee,
the impact of providing its Upstream Guarantee on the Target’s solvency, the specific purpose for providing its
Upstream Guarantee, the risk factors associated with providing its Upstream Guarantee with reference to the
liquidity, the solvency and the price of purchase and/or subscription of the shares in the Target. The board of
directors’ report shall also state that the transaction pursues at the best conditions the corporate benefit of the
Target. The board of directors of the Target will also need to verify that the provision of the Upstream
Guarantee by the Target is provided on “market conditions”, including with specific reference to the Notes, the
interest rate of the Notes and the creditworthiness of the Issuer. Under article 2358, paragraph 6, of the Italian
Civil Code, the aggregate maximum amount of the obligations that will be guaranteed by the Upstream
Guarantee and the related ability of holders of the Notes to recover on the Upstream Guarantee and any security
interests, will at any time be limited to an amount not greater than that of the distributable profits and the
available reserves as set out in the most recent “duly approved financial statements” of the Target, and will in
any event be subject to the additional limitations as set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Collateral, the Upstream Guarantee and any future_
_guarantees or security of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.” and “Limitations_
_on Validity and Enforceability of any Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations—Italy.” In this respect, the form of the Upstream Guarantee to be provided by the Target will_
reflect the foregoing limitations as to the amount of the obligations that will be guaranteed and secured in
respect of the Notes by the Target, upon completion of the Whitewash Procedure. See “Description of the
_Notes—Notes Guarantees.” In addition, under Article 2358, paragraph 6, of the Italian Civil Code, reserves_
which are not distributable in an amount equal to the guarantees issued or security granted in respect of a
principal debt obligation must be accounted for as liability in the financial statements of the relevant Italian
security provider/guarantor. Accordingly, a corresponding amount of profits and/or reserves will not be
available for distribution by the Target until the Upstream Guarantee and any security interests have been
released or discharged, as applicable. In addition, to the extent losses are recorded by the Target at any time, any
such losses could reduce reserves relating to the credit support previously provided by the Target in connection
with the Whitewash Procedure; such losses could arise in the ordinary course of business or in connection with
contingent liabilities and it has been held by prevailing legal analysis that losses will only erode any such
reserves after full impairment of other reserves and share capital. The Whitewash Procedure is subject to certain
conditions and significant limitations under applicable Italian laws and there is no assurance that it will be
completed.


-----

**_Trust_**

There is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and
enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the holders of the
Notes under security interests on Italian assets is debatable under Italian law.

It is uncertain and untested in Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security can be created and perfected in
favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) that are neither directly parties to the relevant security
documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or
public registries and, therefore, the risk of unenforceability by the holders of the Notes of the Italian security
documents posed by Italian law cannot be eliminated or mitigated, with respect to such holders of the Notes
which are not directly parties to the relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein.

Due to the impossibility to clearly identify and keep track over time of the names of the individual holder of the
Notes, the Italian security will be created in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes and in
favor of the Security Agent as representative of all secured creditors. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian
courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such
as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not
specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries;
and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and
the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under
security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

Given the above and considering that the holders of the Notes are not party to the Italian law-governed security
documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes (in relation to which
the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a secured creditor are not perfected at the time
of enforcement) are not secured by the security interests created under the Italian law-governed security
documents and/or cannot enforce that security interest.

To address the above potential issue, the collateral securing the Notes will be granted and perfected in favor of
the Trustee and in favor of Security Agent acting also in its capacity as legal representative (mandatario con
_rappresentanza) of the holders of the Notes. In bond issuances made by Italian joint stock companies (società_
_per azioni), pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (introduced by Law No. 164 of_
November 11, 2014), security interests can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the
holders of the Notes who will then be authorized to enforce them on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The
security governed by Italian law will be created and perfected in favor of the Trustee and in favor of Security
Agent acting also as _rappresentante of the holders of the Notes in accordance with such Article 2414-bis,_
paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code, to the extent applicable. However, there is no guidance or available
interpretation on how such provision may be applied to security created to secure bond issuances made by a
non-Italian entity.

**_Security Agent_**

The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as
representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the
Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security
interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in
favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the
name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial
proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case
law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders
of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the
relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the
appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that
therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured
by the security under the security documents and/or that the _rappresentante_ cannot exercise the rights and


-----

enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and
the subject matter of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are untested by Italian courts and,
therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian court, it cannot be excluded that
an Italian court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted
in favor of the _rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the_
Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral.

Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante
_comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly_
appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of
such appointment may not be upheld by a court.

Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be
created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly
parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share
certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no
established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of
the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is
uncertain under Italian law.

**_Certain additional Considerations in Relation to Granting Security Interests and Guarantees_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect
creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in
case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises
management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management
and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy
as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior
only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the
borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the
borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to Article 164 of the Insolvency Code (as defined below), any payment made
by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration are
ineffective by operation of law. The new provision replaced Article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code,
according to which such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to
shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be
interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either
directly or indirectly. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw back
actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale)” and “—Hardening
_period/clawback and fraudulent transfer” below. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of the Insolvency_
Code sets forth that claims of entities exercising management and coordination powers vis-à-vis the entities
subject to such powers and claims of the entities subject to such powers vis-à-vis the entities exercising them
deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of judicial winding up of in the
year before, are subordinated.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of
such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as
_società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may
apply such provisions relating to Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian
subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the
obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards
other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed
subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the
Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian
subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations
under the Notes.


-----

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or
notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral
created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian
subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

**_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a
liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in
comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of
the Italian law are, first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction
of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security
interests given by it or by way of a trust could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or
judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of
(i) Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942, as subsequently amended and supplemented (the “Italian
**Bankruptcy Law”) and/or (ii) the Insolvency Code (as defined below) and the relevant law on the non-**
insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period
(the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback
actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations—Bankruptcy
_proceedings (fallimento)” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become_
unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of
any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or
guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there
are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could
have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, guarantees, security interest and rights in
general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

- the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors;

- an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the judge;

- with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each
party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to
perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460
of the Italian Civil Code;

- claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian
law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be
or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

- pursuant to Article 1241 et seq. of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or
fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in
its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is
based on reasonable grounds;


-----

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be
limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione
_necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to_
Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application
of such legal concepts under Italian law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or
instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would
survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del
_diritto);_

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may
be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to
the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to
save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of
intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of
such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the
purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil
Code are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest
being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver is
appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and
creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the
enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the
relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the
court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the pledged assets assigned at a fair market value
returning any excess to the judicial liquidation estate;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which
the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of
seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend,
moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until
the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding or bankruptcy/
judicial liquidation proceedings;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to
the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date
(data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that
a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by
one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning
advance waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by
Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of
mandatory provisions;


-----

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian
company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, inter alia,
any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted
under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to
time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any
compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian
Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal
proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for
not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article
120 of the Italian Banking Act) may not be enforceable;

- if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other
parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as
a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

- a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from
continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and

- in case of bankruptcy (to the extent applicable after July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation of the
grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any
third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding or in case of a judicial liquidation, the
pledged assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value and, as a consequence,
the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be
terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/
shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be
brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a
guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a
claw- back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which
results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and
other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke
the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice,
was to make the two following findings:

- that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor,
or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently
designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

- that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the
act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the
fraudulent design.

**Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions with
which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court
procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can
be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be
familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special
provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities


-----

nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned companies
are involved.

Insolvency laws and regulations have been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code. In particular, the
Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing
the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a comprehensive
legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts
a comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters which came into force
on July 15, 2022 (so-called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter, as subsequently amended and
supplemented and including Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022 implementing the EU Directive
2019/1023, the “Insolvency Code”). Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14,
2019 no. 38—Suppl. Ordinario no. 6.

The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt”
(fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a
judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis;” (iii) the adoption of the
same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different restructuring
tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società) provided for by the
same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the
pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings;
(vi) a new crisis settlement procedure (composizione negoziata della crisi); (vii) jurisdiction of specialized
courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) the adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main
interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings, (ix) the introduction of the new
restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) among the
restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società); (x) the
regulation of adequate measures and plans to early detect a crisis with specific criteria to be adopted by
companies and (xi) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general
effectiveness of the reform.

The Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian Legislative Decree
No. 147 of October 26, 2020, (ii) the Italian Draft Legislative Decree on “Amendments to the Business Crisis
and Insolvency Code, implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1023” approved on March 17, 2022 by the Italian
Council of Ministers (Consiglio dei Ministri) and (iii) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022.

Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on
March 16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been
postponed to September 1, 2021 by the “Decreto liquidità” (i.e., Law Decree April 8, 2020, no. 23, published in
the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted in law by the Italian Parliament by the Law June 5, 2020,
no. 40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”), and is now effective
starting from July 15, 2022.

Provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law continue to apply only to any filings for proposals of declaration of
insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare) and any filings seeking for
the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or for the opening of a
composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or pending before July 15, 2022 (i.e., the
effective date of the Insolvency Code).

Considering the above, the following is a brief description of certain main aspects of insolvency law in Italy as it
stands now and in particular: (i) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the other ancillary applicable regulations in
place until July 15, 2022 and (ii) of the Insolvency Code after its entry into force.

**Italian Bankruptcy Law – applicable to proceedings filed or opened before July 15, 2022 only**

In particular, please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the
other ancillary applicable regulations.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill
of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis”
procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced
by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the


-----

businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to
promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially
distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency
(insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more
creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no
longer able to regularly meet with ordinary means its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent
rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial
distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard
the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a
subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

In addition to the composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio_ described below, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are available under
Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies.

**_Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process (Accordi Stragiudiziali)_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it provides the debtor with
significant advantages and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court
restructuring are vulnerable to being very likely reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency,
and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger various liabilities in the event of a subsequent
bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing temporary financial difficulties, it may be
possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the
company.

**_Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (introduced by Law Decree 118/2021)_**

The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two
following circumstances: **_(i)_** when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree
118/2021 requesting the competent court pursuant to Article 9 of the Insolvency Code, to confirm or modify the
protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if necessary, to enact the interim measures provided for
pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021 on the same day as the publication of the request in the
relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below); and
if necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures” and, together with the Protective Measures,
the “Measures”), and **_(ii)_** when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree
118/2021 asking the court to authorize certain acts, or to modify the conditions of certain contracts if, as a
consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur.

The _composizione negoziata della crisi_ can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore
_commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo) which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_
assets, their business and/or their finance such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow and it is
likely that the financial recovery shall occur, notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian
Bankruptcy Law are not met.

Pursuant to Article 5 of the Law Decree 118/2021, _inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a_
_composizione negoziata della crisi (i) shall certify that no requests for the admission to a concordato preventivo_
procedure nor accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti have been previously filed to the court in such respect and
(ii) in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata della crisi is dismissed, may not submit a new
request before one year has elapsed after the aforementioned dismissal.

Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply to
corporate groups, in order to provide for the possibility of the negotiated proceeding to take place in a unitary
form. It should be noted that Paragraph 10 of such provision provides for the group companies – at the end of
the negotiations – to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 11 of the Law Decree
118/2021 (as set out below) as a whole group or enter separately as single companies into the solutions referred
to therein.


-----

The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the
filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and independent expert (the “Expert”), which however,
pursuant to Article 23 of the Law Decree 118/2021, is prevented for enterprises having filed to access the
procedures, debt restructuring agreements and/or concordato preventivo, including (i) pursuant to Article 161,
Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, (ii) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law and (iii) the procedures of over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets
referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No. 3 of January 27, 2012 (i.e. procedimenti di composizione della
_crisi da sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio) pending such procedures. Pursuant to Article 4 of_
the Law Decree 118/2021 the person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or
maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the
negotiated proceeding.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties
involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic
meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith
and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s financial and business
situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course
of the negotiations.

If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the
entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the
Chamber of Commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition.

The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not
agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed
situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue for up to an additional 180 days (pursuant to Article
5, Paragraph 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the
Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a
petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert
issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to
the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any), which declares the termination
of their related effects.

Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or
with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of the Protective Measures. The
Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting
creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) (unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur) and all
enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo,
payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims.

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures, until the date
of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur
cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent by the court.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their
obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their
expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the
missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the
Protective Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), he must
simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures
and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures
will be ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by a court order
in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the
Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240


-----

days. The judge, in his or her discretion, may order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their
duration.

Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective
Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the
purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations, or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice
caused to the creditors that file the relevant request.

Pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary and activity, and, upon
written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent
with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic
and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that
the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the
enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the
perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If,
notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives
immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register.
When Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court
which may revoke such measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree
118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent
that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the
creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

- the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same corporate group to incur new supersenior (prededucibile) indebtedness pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

- the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior (prededucibile) indebtedness pursuant to Article 111 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law via shareholders’ financing;

- the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided
under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the
court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking into account the requests of the
parties concerned, in order to protect the interests of all relevant parties involved.

Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the _composizione negoziata della crisi_ can terminate as
follow:

- execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause
for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021 if,
according to the Expert’s Final Report, such contract ensures the continuation of the business as a
going concern for at least 2 years;

- execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 _octies_ of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law;

- execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the
effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. In such case,
the independent expert’s report (attestazione) shall not be required.

At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt
restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182 _bis,_
Article 182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Alternatively, the entrepreneur may:


-----

- arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67,
Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

- file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio pursuant
to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021, which pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021
can be filed only following the end of the negotiations;

- enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the socalled Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure.

Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021:

- the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their
effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with_
creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative
winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent
companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del_
_patrimonio;_

- the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting
of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back
actions pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the
development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery in place at the
time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made;

- acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted
its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or if the court
has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021;

- payment and transactions, made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to
be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery of the
enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree
118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions, provided
for pursuant to Article 216 and 217 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

**_Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio (introduced by Law Decree_**
**_118/2021)_**

Article 25-sexies of the Insolvency Code introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation
composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio)._

If, in its Final Report, in the context of a _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_
proceeding, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have been conducted
according to fairness and good faith, that the options provided under Article 23, paragraphs 1 and 2, letter b), of
the Insolvency Code are not feasible and the entrepreneur has not been able to reach an agreement with its
creditors, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file to the
competent court where the entrepreneur has its center of main interests a petition for admission to the
_concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents_
listed under Article 39 of the Insolvency Code. The petition for concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court. From_
the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Insolvency Code are
produced.

Following the filing of such application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to, inter alia,
express an opinion on the entrepreneur’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the opinion of the
auxiliary and the final report of the expert, be delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing on the list filed


-----

by the debtor itself; and (iii) sets the date of the hearing for the court approval (omologazione). Creditors and
any third party which has any interests are entitled to object to the court approval (omologazione) within ten
days before the date fixed for the hearing.

If the court, having verified the legitimacy of the objection and the procedure, as well as compliance with
priority creditor claims and the feasibility of the liquidation plan, finds that the proposal does not prejudice the
creditors with respect to the alternative of a judicial winding-up liquidation and that, in any event, it ensures a
benefit to each creditor, it approves the composition with creditors proposal by decree, by which it shall also
appoint a liquidator.

The court issues a decree of approval (omologazione) the _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del_
_patrimonio_ when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and
regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with
preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause
a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the
entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been
notified of the same.

Pursuant to Article 25-septies of the Insolvency Code, the liquidation plan may also include an offer by a preidentified third party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or specific assets to such
third party, even before the approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having verified the absence of better
solutions on the market, may implement the offer.

**_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of_**
**_the Italian Bankruptcy Law_**

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento) prepared by
companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An
independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the
truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint
the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the
requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of
misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore,
no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring
agreements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring
the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement
proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any
protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors or any public
authority including tax authorities. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the
debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the
implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action;
and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the
court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is
possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity
or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors
proceeding or a debt restructuring agreement.

**_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_**
**_(accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_**

The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt restructuring
agreements, subject to court’s sanctioning (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must
assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the
agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-adhering creditors can be fully satisfied within the


-----

following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the
case of debts which are due and payable to the non-adhering creditors as of the date of the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the
relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-adhering creditors as of the
date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is
insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to
insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. The
Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt
restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business
by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing
agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also
contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned
publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the
companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the
completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the
publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the
creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place
and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can
security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60
days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited.

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an
application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of
the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the
publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court
will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Italian Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the
outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._

The new Article 182 bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of May
21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial
amendments are made to the plan, inter alia, if any substantial change to the plan are is necessary or required
before or after the homologation of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors, the entrepreneur shall make
the appropriate changes aimed at the implementation of such plan, requesting (i) the independent expert to
renew its report as well as (ii) the creditors involved in such debt restructuring agreement to manifest their
consent the necessary amendments.

The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182 _septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and_
introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182 octies, Article 182 novies and Article 182 decies,
thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021,
the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is reduced to
the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under Article
182 bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (therefore implying that the plan must be
adequate and capable for the full and timely payment of dissenting creditors); (b) does not previously file a
petition for admission to the _concordato in bianco_ pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, and does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 _septies_ of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt
restructuring agreements by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits


-----

belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests),
and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a
so-called “cram-down”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-adhering creditors are not
treated worse than under any effectively available alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall
be of a non-liquidating nature, **_(ii)_** the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the
business activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly
notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt
restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa). If these conditions are met, the
remaining 25% of non-adhering creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however,
non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the agreement and refuse to be forced into it.

The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final
Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is set
forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the
debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial
intermediaries and have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the
agreement to non-adhering creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid
even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect for the continuation of the business activity as a going
concern. However, in such case, the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain
valid.

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 _octies_ of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement
(convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class
would also bind non-adhering creditors, provided that _(A)_ an independent expert meeting the requirements
provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies _(i)_ the truthfulness of the
business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii)
the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the recovery
strategies undertaken by the debtor and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to
the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations, have been made able to
participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets,
economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down
creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 _septies_ of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the
standstill agreement provided under Article 182 _octies_ of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new
obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing
facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-adhering creditors.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021,
Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring
agreements. Non-adhering creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable
with the debtor, _(ii)_ the debtor’s guarantors and _(iii)_ debtors by way of right of recourse _(regresso). Unless_
agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable
with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will
remain liable as guarantors.

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the
approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) enjoy
priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders,
but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for
a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (finanza ponte)
or granted in execution of the composition with creditors (finanza in esecuzione) may be granted such priority
status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided
for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the
approval of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors.

Moreover, pursuant to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian


-----

Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in
relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors procedure described below) may
authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such
indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by
the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione),
declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to
pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due,
provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and
to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. The aforementioned authorization may be given also before the
filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring
agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo)
outlined below.

Furthermore, according to Article 182 _quinquies, Paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the_
sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182- bis, Paragraph 1 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called
_prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_
debtor, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that
it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an
imminent and irreparable prejudice to the debtor.

**_Court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to
insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal
to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its
business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such
composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds:
(i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three
preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each
of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor
company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a
restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the
truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for _concordato_
_preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the_
date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the
creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed.
During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose
title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the
court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato
_preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors._

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and
payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner (provided that, in any case, it will
ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors
with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to
their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other
financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the
debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different
treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax
settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.


-----

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition
for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the
latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective
receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation
within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary
petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for
such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the
approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the
court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to
overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims,
declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which,
upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting
and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing
for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato
_preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco)._

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years
without the admission to the _concordato preventivo_ having followed. The decree setting the term for the
presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfil, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being
declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant
requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried
out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the
restructuring plan, the court may, _ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial_
commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with
creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the
court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness
authorized by the court aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business, pending
the _concordato in bianco, as well as the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement_
pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the _moratorium_
application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan
pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, are treated as super-senior (so
called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and
security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super-seniority of the claims - which arise out of
loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors
(domanda di pre-concordato) - is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional
upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the
company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the
preliminary petition.

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the
debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets
which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these
cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as
a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and
support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of
the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition


-----

proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide
for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to
supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’
meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its
corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge.
The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior judge’s authorization,
while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim
acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of
(a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan
provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The _concordato preventivo_ is
approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did
not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure
of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting
right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of
the Notes in the concordato proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture
with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the
Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities
in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are
not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security,
or the _concordato preventivo_ provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided that
they receive, at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets, as assessed by an
independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the
proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or
more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the
interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If
an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there
are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may
nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be
satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for
individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the
aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy courtsupervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met,
including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the
unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors
proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti
_chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on the_
continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a pre-bankruptcy court-supervised
composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy
court-supervised composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and
having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors
are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims.

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on
the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant
special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by
taking all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by
Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo),


-----

pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of
the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may
request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest
of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised
by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be
authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti),
except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment
agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti
_preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di_
_locazione di immobili). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_
application for the _concordato preventivo_ or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after
admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a
period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right
to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such
indemnification would be paid according to the concordato preventivo proposal.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public
prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company
bankrupt.

**_Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_**

A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial
liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor
when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no
longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by
the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises
(imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii)_
has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three
preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things:

- subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a
defined period;

- under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their
claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of
the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case
the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding
balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured
debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the
bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides
whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its decision;

- the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy
receiver (curatore fallimentare);

- continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage
to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to
creditors;

- any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in
certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other
than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and


-----

- the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration is suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of
the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by
Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a designated
judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one
of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as
a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation
of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real
estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the
liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain
preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian Tax Authority, and judicial and social security
authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is
untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor
contractual agreements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent
with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure
creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated.

- **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can**
terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant
petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the declaration
of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one
year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness
to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of
_concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the_ _concordato_
_fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_
assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in
respect of the part of their claim affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of
creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of
creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part.
The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors
holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the
claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required.

- **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may**
be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU
jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be
allocated according to the following order: **_(i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims_**
originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); **_(ii) for payment of_**
claims that benefit from preferential treatment, which include creditors who hold a security interest
(creditori ipotecari o pignoratizi) and creditors who have a preference under law (creditori privilegiati
_in senso stretto); and_ **_(iii)_** for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the
proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority.
Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities
of claims. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds
derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

- **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or**
avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or
of the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key
avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and
transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally
considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in
other jurisdictions.


-----

In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six
months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. Please
note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period
may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between
acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the
request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

- **Acts ineffective by operation of law**

(1) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions
entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity
in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is
ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate
by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to
wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may
challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and

(2) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the
insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt
entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.

- **Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver / court**
**commissioner**

a. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below (socalled “suspect period”), may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided
for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the noninsolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s
insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

i. onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when
the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds
25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

ii. payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by
other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration;

iii. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the
insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at
the time when the new security was granted; and

iv. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the
insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen
due at the time when the new security was granted.

b. The following acts and transactions, if made during the suspect period or such other period
specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy
receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the
time of the act or transaction:

i. payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions
entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and

ii. granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the
insolvency declaration.

c. The following transactions are exempted from claw-back actions:


-----

i. payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to
market practice;

ii. a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently
reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

iii. the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of
the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a
residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the
purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that
is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the
date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the
investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

iv. transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor
pursuant to a piano attestato di risanamento under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d)
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

v. a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of a
_concordato preventivo pursuant to Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an_
_accordo di ristrutturazione del debito_ pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law;

vi. remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants
concerning work carried out by them; and

vii. payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with
respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity
be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for
by the Italian Civil Code.

Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt
entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such
creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into
prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the
bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered
into for consideration with a third-party, the third-party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was
entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third-party participated in the fraudulent
design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified”
clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the
aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start
enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing
back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out
without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called
_fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried_
out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser.

**Insolvency Code**

Please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Insolvency Code after its entry force on July
15, 2022, which supersedes the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The two primary aims of the Insolvency Code are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the
going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. The aim of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or
“Marzano” procedure (which remain available to large companies also in the context of the new set of rules, as
will be further detailed below), is to maintain employment. These competing aims often have been balanced by


-----

the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses
being sold.

Under the Insolvency Code, the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) must be declared by a court, based
on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a debtor upon a petition filed by the debtor itself, the public prosecutor and/or
one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2, letter (b) of the Insolvency Code, is defined as the
state of the debtor, manifested by defaults and/or other external elements evidencing that the debtor is no longer
able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary status of
insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a debtor is insolvent. The Insolvency Code also introduced a specific
concept of crisis, which is defined under Article 2, letter (a) of the Insolvency Code as the state of the debtor
such that it is likely that insolvency will follow, which is manifested by the inadequacy of prospective cash
flows to meet obligations in the following 12 months. Both insolvency and crisis are factual situations upon the
occurrence of which different instruments provided for by the Insolvency Code may be activated.

In cases where a debtor is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, a state of
crisis/financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which
may safeguard the existence of the debtor, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of
a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

The following debt restructuring and insolvency alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a
state of crisis and for insolvent debtors and, in certain cases, also to debtors experiencing an economic or
financial imbalance such as to make it likely that a state of crisis and/or distress or their insolvency will occur.

**_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor
and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are
vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as
voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases
where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court
arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

**_Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa pursuant to the Insolvency Code_**

The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa was originally introduced in the Italian legal
framework by Law Decree 118/2021 and has been subsequently incorporated into the Insolvency Code. It is an
out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the
entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 18 of the Insolvency Code requesting the competent court to
confirm or modify the Protective Measures provided for pursuant to Article 18 of the Insolvency Code on the
same day as the publication of the request in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the
acceptance of the Expert (as defined below), and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures necessary to
complete the negotiations, and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition asking the court to authorize certain
acts in line with the provisions set forth under Article 22 of the Insolvency Code.

The _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_ is a proceeding aimed at facilitating the
recovery of companies which “despite being in conditions of asset or economic and financial imbalance such as
to make it likely that financial distress or insolvency will occur, have the potential to remain in the market,
including through the sale of the business or a branch of it.”

According to Article 12 of the Insolvency Code, the _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi_
_d’impresa_ can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore commerciale) and agricultural
(imprenditore agricolo), which are undergoing a distressed situation with reference to their assets, their business
and/or their financial situation, such that it is likely that a distress/crisis or insolvency will follow. It is,
therefore, a procedure aiming at anticipating further deterioration of the debtor’s situation. Pursuant to Article
17, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Insolvency Code, _inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a_
_composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_ (i) shall certify that no judicial winding-up
proceedings or similar proceedings are pending towards itself nor requests for the admission to the procedures
provided for under Articles 40 of the Insolvency Code, including pursuant to Articles 44, paragraph 1, letter a)
and 54, paragraph 3, have been previously filed and (ii) in the event that the application for a _composizione_


-----

_negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_ is dismissed, other than the case where such dismissal is
requested by the entrepreneur, may not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after dismissal.

Pursuant to Article 25 of the Insolvency Code, the _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi_
_d’impresa may also apply to group of companies, which may commence one proceeding all together. It should_
be noted that paragraph 9 of such provision provides for the group companies—at the end of the negotiations—
to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 23, paragraph 1 of the Insolvency Code as a
group, or use one of the tools referred to under Article 23 of the Insolvency Code, both separately or as a whole
group. The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is commenced on a voluntary basis
only, filing of a petition for the appointment of a third-party and independent expert to the Secretary General of
the relevant Chamber of Commerce by way of a dedicated electronic platform (the “Expert”). Pending a
procedure for over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14ter of Law No 3 of January 27, 2012 (i.e., procedimenti di composizione della crisi da sovraindebitamento e di
_liquidazione del patrimonio), the petition cannot be filed. Pursuant to Article 16 of the Insolvency Code the_
person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations
with the entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the negotiated proceeding.

The Expert is appointed within five days upon the filing of the request. The Expert is responsible for facilitating
and managing the negotiations between the company, its creditors and any other interested parties, in order to
identify a solution to overcome the crisis or the insolvency, including through the transfer of the business or a
branch thereof.

The Expert assesses his/her own independence, the adequacy of his/her own professional expertise and his/her
own time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is
positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative
outcome, the Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert
accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are concrete and
real chances of recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally and can be assisted by its advisors.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete and real chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the
parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic
meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith
and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the
actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the
negotiations. The entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation and manage
his/her assets without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents,
and, in case of credit assignment and/or transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations
actively and in an informed manner, and the access to the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi
_d’impresa does not, by itself, constitute ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply_
to negotiations involving employment contracts.

If the Expert finds that there are no real chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the
entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the
chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s
appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a
solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation.
However, the Expert’s appointment can continue up to further 180 days (pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 7 of
the Insolvency Code) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the
prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court
pursuant to Article 19 and/or Article 22 of the Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 8 of the Insolvency Code, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a
final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court
that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any) which declares the termination of their
related effects.

Pursuant to Article 18 of the Insolvency Code, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a
subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures, which may also be
limited, upon entrepreneur request, to certain creditors’ claims or to a specific category of creditors. The
Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting


-----

creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all
enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo,
payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims.

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date
of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for the _composizione negoziata, the ruling of_
opening the judicial winding-up proceeding (sentenza di apertura della liquidazione giudiziale) or the
declaration of the insolvency of the entrepreneur cannot be declared insolvent by the court, provided that the
court revokes the Protective Measures.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their
obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their
expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the
missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the
Protective Measures. However, the creditors may suspend the fulfilment of the pending contracts from the
publication of the petition requesting Protective Measures to the obtainment of such Protective Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), it must
simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures
and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures
will be ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of
the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of
the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240
days, given that the judge may discretionary order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their
duration.

During the procedure the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management of
the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of the Insolvency Code,
pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written
notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the
negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and
financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the
entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in
the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the
perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If,
notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives
immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. At
the request of the entrepreneur, one or more creditors or the Expert, the Court that has granted the Protective
Measures and/or Interim Measures may, at any time, revoke such measures or reduce their duration when they
do not meet the aim of ensuring the positive outcome of the negotiations or they appear disproportionate in
relation to the prejudice caused to the creditors, pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 6 of the Insolvency Code. If
the Protective Measures are revoked, the prohibition of the obtainment of preemption rights by preexisting
creditors ceases to be effective for the date on which the Protective Measure has been revoked.

Pursuant to Article 22 of the Insolvency Code, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that
this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the
creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

(a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior
indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 6 of the Insolvency Code;

(b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called _prededucibile) via shareholders’_
financing pursuant to Article 6 of the Insolvency Code; and

(c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under
Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to Article 2112 of the Italian Civil


-----

Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers
appropriate, taking also into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect all the
interests involved. The court shall also verify the compliance with the competitiveness principle in
choosing the purchaser.

Pursuant to Article 23 of the Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa
can terminate as follow:

(a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause
for application of the reward measures provided under Article 25-bis, paragraph 1 of the Insolvency
Code if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business
as a going concern for at least 2 years;

(b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the Insolvency
Code;

(c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects
provided under Articles 166, paragraph 3, lett. d) and 324. With such agreement the Expert
acknowledges that the reorganization plan (piano di risanamento) seems to be consistent with the
composition of the insolvency and crisis of the entrepreneur.

At the end of the negotiations, if none of the above-mentioned agreement is executed, the entrepreneur may
alternatively:

(a) file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di
ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Insolvency Code. The percentage
referred to under Article 61, paragraph 2, letter c) of the Insolvency Code is reduced to 60% if the
achievement of the agreement results from the final report of the Expert.

(b) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the
Insolvency Code;

(c) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio provided
for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Insolvency Code;

(d) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Insolvency Code or in the so-called
Prodi-bis procedure or the Marzano procedure;

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 24 of the Insolvency Code:

(a) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Insolvency Code shall maintain their effects
in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition_
with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), opening of the judicial winding-up proceeding
(apertura della liquidazione giudiziale), a sanctioned restructuring plan provided for pursuant to Article
64-bis of the Insolvency Code, a compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta
_amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione_
_straordinaria) or simplified pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors agreement aimed at the_
liquidation of the debtor’s assets (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) provided
for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Insolvency Code;

(b) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of
security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions
pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Insolvency Code if they are consistent with the development
and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time
the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made;

(c) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted
its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 165 and Article 166 of the
Insolvency Code if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register pursuant to Article


-----

21, paragraph 4 of the Insolvency Code or if the competent court has denied its authorization pursuant to
Article 22 of the Insolvency Code; and

(d) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to
be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery
(risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the
Insolvency Code, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions.

**_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Insolvency_**
**_Code_**

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento)
addressed to the creditors and prepared by debtors who are either insolvent or in a state of crisis, in order to
restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert
appointed directly by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro dei
_Revisori Contabili) must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data_
provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the independent expert. The
independent expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the
requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of
misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court reorganization plans and the relevant debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of
judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising
authority. Also, Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to
by a specific majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided they are finalized at restructuring the
debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. However, the possibility to adopt such tools to
liquidate the debtor is disputed, as it is argued they shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s
indebtedness and the rebalancing its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-judicial
liquidation agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not
offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party
creditors. The Insolvency Code provides that, should these plans fail, and the debtor be declared insolvent, the
payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted on the debtor’s assets for the implementation
of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to any claw-back action (azione
_revocatoria), including the claw-back action provided for pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, as_
provided for pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Insolvency Code; and (b) are exempted from
the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the
Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register of the plan, the report by the
independent expert and the arrangements is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax
benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court
pre-judicial liquidation agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the reorganization plan (or the
agreements entered into to implement it) is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be
excluded that the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent judicial
winding-up, if the competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was
certified by the independent expert.

Unlike Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Insolvency Code sets forth specific rules regarding Out-of-court
reorganization plans and the relevant restructuring arrangements entered into with creditors, which must be
followed for the plans and agreements to grant protection against claw-back actions and potential civil and
criminal responsibilities. More in detail, out-of-court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 56 of the
Insolvency Code must be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial
situation of the debtor and which also needs to indicate, among others, the causes of the crisis and the new
resources which will be made available to the debtor and the industrial plan. Moreover, they must be suitable for
the purpose of assuring the restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor and rebalancing its financial position
and, in case of its failure and subsequent challenge (impugnazione) before an Italian court, it must not be
deemed as being unreasonable.

**_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57 of_**
**_the Insolvency Code_**

Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) provided for pursuant to
Article 57 and ff. of the Insolvency Code may be entered into by the debtor with creditors holding at least 60%
of the outstanding indebtedness, to be sanctioned (omologato) by the competent court. An independent expert
appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the
company and declare and that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the indebtedness
vis-à-vis non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms in a 120-day term from: (i)
the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and
payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts
which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning
_(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 57 of the Insolvency Code,_
only a debtor who is insolvent or facing a state of crisis (as described above) can initiate this process and request
the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication.
Creditors and other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the
agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled with the opposition (if any), the court will validate
(omologare) the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 30 days of its publication
pursuant to Article 51 of the Insolvency Code.

The Insolvency Code does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt
restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the debtor or a third-party carrying
out the business, or the sale of the business, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs
and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement
for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Article 58, paragraph 1 of the Insolvency Code sets the rule
for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. More precisely, in the event of substantial amendments
to the plan before the approval, the report issued by the expert and the consent to the debt restructuring
agreement expressed by creditors shall be renewed. The report shall also be renewed in the event of substantial
amendment. In the event of substantial amendments after the approval, the debtor shall make such amendments
as are appropriate to ensure the implementation of the agreements, by requesting the update of the certified
report issued by the expert having the requirements set forth in Article 57, paragraph 4 of the Insolvency Code.
In this case, the renewed certified report, together with the amended restructuring plan, shall be published in the
companies’ register, giving appropriate notice to the creditors by registered letter or by certified email (PEC).
The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been
notified of the same.

**_The key features of a debt restructuring agreement_**

With the petition for the approval by the court of the debt restructuring agreement (or at any time pending the
procedure) the debtor may request to be granted any Measures (e.g., a stay of actions or the creation by creditors
of security interest (unless it is agreed in the debt restructuring agreement) in relation to pre-existing debts, etc.).
Such Measures can also be requested (i) pursuant to Article 54, paragraph 3 of the Insolvency Code, to the court
by the debtor pending negotiations with creditors (i.e., prior to the filing of the petition for approval of the
agreement), subject to certain conditions, or (ii) pursuant to Article 44 of the Insolvency Code, together with a
pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Insolvency Code. According to
Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for approval of the debt restructuring
agreement includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the
companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or,
in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). No dispossession of debtor occurs
in respect of a debt restructuring agreement, but the court may appoint a judicial commissioner to oversee the
proceedings and must do so in case petitions for the opening of judicial liquidation are pending, when it is
necessary for the protection of the parties who filed such petitions. It is a court-supervised procedure, which can
take from a few months up to more than a year (the duration of the proceedings is generally influenced by
challenges). Creditors entering into the debt restructuring agreement are not required to receive the same
treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal and to protect their interests otherwise) and no cram-down is
applicable to third-party non-adhering creditors, who shall be fully re-paid within 120 days from validation
(omologa) of the debt restructuring agreement (if the claims are already due and payable at such date) or within


-----

120 days from the respective maturity date if such creditors’ claims are not yet due as of the validation date of
such debt restructuring agreement as per respectively Article 57, paragraph 3 letters a) and b).

The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing
to be held no earlier of 15 days from the notification of the relevant filing. Pending such deadline, creditors and
other interested parties may file an opposition to the approval. At such hearing, the court decides upon any
opposition and assesses whether the conditions for the approval are met.

Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Insolvency Code, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreement
by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category
(with respect to the homogeneity of their status and economic interests) and can request the court to declare that
agreement binding on the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”).

More in detail, debt restructuring agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad efficacia
_estesa) provided pursuant to Article 61 of the Insolvency Code-which were previously only permitted in relation_
to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries where such debts represented at least 50% of the total
indebtedness - can now be applied to any category of creditors, provided that, _inter alia: (i) all the creditors_
belonging to the same category have been informed of the start of the negotiations and have been able to
participate in them in good faith and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets,
economic and financial situation as well as on the restructuring agreement and its effects; (ii) the agreement
provides for the continuation of the business activity either directly or indirectly pursuant to Article 84 of the
Insolvency Code; (iii) the claims of the consenting creditors belonging to a same category represent at least 75%
of all the claims belonging to the same category; (iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category
to which the effects of the agreement are extended can be satisfied under the agreement for an amount not lower
than the amount they would receive with the judicial liquidation being understood that a creditor may hold
claims in more than one category; and (v) the debtor has notified the agreement, the application for court
approval and the documents attached thereto to the creditors to be crammed down. The percentage of 75% is
lowered to 60% if the debt restructuring agreement is referred to in the Final Report issued by the Expert at the
end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa.

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 61, paragraph 5, of the Insolvency Code, a special provision is set forth
for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt
restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial
intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the
agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is
valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going
concern. However, in such case the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain
valid.

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 62 of the Insolvency Code, a standstill agreement (convenzione di
_moratoria) entered into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind_
the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided
under Article 62, paragraph 3 of the Insolvency Code has been appointed and certifies (i) the truthfulness of the
business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii)
the fact that the treatment reserved to non-adhering creditors is at least equal to the one they could obtain in the
context of a judicial winding up, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to
the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations, have been made able to
participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets,
economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down
creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

In no case debt restructuring agreements provided for under Article 61 of the Insolvency Code and standstill
agreements provided under Article 62 of the Insolvency Code may impose on the non-adhering creditors, inter
_alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility_
to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities.

Furthermore, Article 60 of the Insolvency Code provides for the so-called facilitated debt restructuring
agreement (“accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati”). Such proceeding, is a particular kind of debt restructuring
agreement which may be entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% of the total indebtedness
(instead of the 60% generally required under Article 57, paragraph 1, of the Insolvency Code) provided that the


-----

debtor: (i) has waived the standstill on the payment of non-consenting creditors (usually provided for by law, for
a period of 120 days from the court approval of the agreement or from the maturity date of the relevant
obligations, in “ordinary” restructuring agreements); and (ii) has not previously requested to the court the
granting of protective interim measures on the its assets.

By virtue of Article 59 of the Insolvency Code, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors
that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims
towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii)
debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce
effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such
shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors.

Pursuant to Article 101 of the Insolvency Code, any financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a debt
restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors) sanctioned by
the competent court enjoy super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent judicial
liquidation, save for the below (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80%
of such financing, unless the lender has become a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt
restructuring agreement or of the supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors, as in such case the
priority status is afforded to 100% of the financing) accordingly with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of
Insolvency Code. In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding
(liquidazione giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status
(prededucibilità) in case the composition plan or the debt restructuring agreement, on the basis of an assessment
to be made at the time of the relevant filing, results to be based upon false data or omission of relevant
information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and also in
case the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such
circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

Pursuant to Article 99 of the Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related claims) granted, in any
form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a debt
restructuring agreement or a court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) (finanza
_ponte) described below or granted in execution of the composition with creditors (finanza in esecuzione), may_
be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such
priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the _concordato preventivo. The same_
provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount (unless the lender has become
a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement under Article 57 of the
Insolvency Code or of the supervised composition with creditors, as in such case the priority status is afforded to
100% of the financing).

Moreover, pursuant to Article 99 of the Insolvency Code, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of
the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 57 of the Insolvency Code or after the filing of the
moratorium application pursuant to Article 86, of the Insolvency Code or a petition pursuant to Article 87 of the
Insolvency Code (in relation to the court supervised composition with creditors procedure described below) may
authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such
indebtedness, subject to the court’s authorisation with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims,
provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company
until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing are functional to the continuity of the
business activities until the sanctioning (omologa) of the relevant insolvency proceedings and in any case are
aimed at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving
from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares
that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for
all creditors.

The provision of Article 99 of the Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the
court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below.

Pursuant to Article 100 of the Insolvency Code, in the event of a composition with creditors on a going concern
basis:

    - the debtor may repay, in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, the installments due under
a loan agreement which is secured by way of a security interest over the assets used in the


-----

business, provided that: (a) at the date of the filing of the application for admission to the
composition with creditors, the debtor has fulfilled its obligations or the court authorizes the
payment of the debt for principal and interest due at that date; and (b) the expert meeting the
requirements set forth in Article 52, paragraph 3, of the Insolvency Code certifies (i) that such
payments are essential for the continuation of the business activity and functional to ensuring the
best satisfaction of the creditors (as already required by Article 100 of the Insolvency Code) and,
(ii) that the secured claims can be fully satisfied with the proceeds of the liquidation of the asset
carried out at market value and that the repayment of the installments due does not prejudice the
rights of the other creditors;

    - the court may authorize payment of the remuneration due, for the months preceding the filing of
the application for the composition with creditors, to the workers employed in the business whose
continuation is envisaged under the plan.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 73 of the Insolvency Code, in case of revocation of the approval (omologa), the
court, upon the debtor’s petition, shall order the conversion to a judicial winding-up procedure. If the revocation
results from acts of fraud (atti in frode ai creditori) or non-performance of the obligations arising under the debt
restructuring agreement, the petition for conversion may also be proposed by creditors or by the public
prosecutor. In case of conversion, the court shall grant additional time to the debtor aimed at supplementing the
documentation and shall act in accordance with Article 270 of the Insolvency Code.

**_Court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (as defined above) and that has not been declared
insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in
order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of
insolvency and the initiation of insolvency proceedings (so called “concordato preventivo”). Such composition
proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had
assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal
years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three
preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess (included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million.
Only the debtor can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo with the court based in the location
of the debtor’s main office. The debtor must file the petition together with, among others, a restructuring plan
containing an analytic description of manner and timing of the fulfillment of the proposal and an independent
expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and
accounting data provided by the company). The petition for _concordato preventivo_ is then published by the
debtor in the company’s register by the registry of the court and communicated to the public prosecutor. From
the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the _concordato preventivo, preexisting_
creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90
days preceding the date on which the petition for the _concordato preventivo_ is published in the company’s
register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the
Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for the admission to the _concordato_ proceedings includes the
relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is
prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any
initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). As already described with reference to debt restructuring
agreements, at any time pending the proceedings, the debtor may request to be granted Measures, which can
also be requested pursuant to Article 44 of the Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for the access to
one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Insolvency Code.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and
payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of
at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of
the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale), including through extraordinary transactions, such as
the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds
convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver
(assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of
creditors into classes (which is mandatory in certain cases provided under the Article 85 of the Insolvency
Code), provided that each class is composed of creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic
interests; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may
also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Save for the


-----

provisions provided for under Article 109 of the Insolvency Code, Article 86 of the Insolvency Code has
provided that, in the context of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis (concordato con
_continuità), the plan may provide for a standstill for the secured creditors, which may extend up to six months_
from the date of sanctioning (omologa) of the composition with creditors proposal for the payment of secured
creditors (creditori privilegiati) pursuant to Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code (i.e. employees,
professionals etc.).

Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured
creditors, a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a
composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets
sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that (i) with the relevant filing for such
proceeding, external resources are contributed which increase the assets available at the time of such filing by at
least 10% and (ii) the degraded secured creditors as well as unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage equal to
20% of their total claims. In this respect, it should be noted that resources contributed for the purpose of a
composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed
notwithstanding the provisions set forth under Articles 2740 and 2741 of the Italian Civil Code provided that
such distribution complies with the 20% requirement set forth above. Resources contributed are considered as
“external” when provided for any reason by the debtor’s shareholders without obligation of repayment or
subordination, in relation to which the plan provides them to be for the sole benefit of the creditors. This
provision does not apply to composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern
(concordato con continuità aziendale).

Under the composition with creditors, there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains
management powers under the supervision of a court-appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and the deputy
judge. From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato
_preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its business, although extraordinary_
transactions require the prior written approval of the court. Provided that the abovementioned steps are taken,
during this time, all enforcement actions, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors,
whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. The accrual of interests is suspended for the same timeframe, except
for claims secured by pledges, liens or mortgages. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless
authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition
for the concordato preventivo is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing
creditors. Any act, payment or security executed or created after the filing of the _concordato preventivo_
application and in accordance with its rules and procedures is exempt from claw-back action. The debtor is also
exempt from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 322, third paragraph (“preferential
bankruptcy”), and 323 (“simple bankruptcy”) of the Insolvency Code, in relation to acts and payments made in
execution of the composition with creditors and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 99 of the
Insolvency Code upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed
company have super senior priority (prededucibilità) in the event of a subsequent judicial winding-up (see
“Statutory priorities” below).

For details regarding super senior financing, please refer to the paragraph relating to debt restructuring
agreements.

The filing of the petition for the _concordato preventivo_ may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary and
simplified petition pursuant to Article 44 of the Insolvency Code. For sake of clarity, under Insolvency Code,
the simplified petition may be _utilized_ by the debtor also to access a debt restructuring agreement or a
restructuring plan subject to approval by the court (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) or a
_concordato. The debtor company may file such petition, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the_
proposal and all relevant documentation (or the debt restructuring agreement, or the restructuring plan) within a
period assigned by the court (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition,
subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such
extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial winding-up proceeding are not pending.
If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may, among other things: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner
(commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the
activities under Article 106 of the Insolvency Code (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one
or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the
court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set
forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. As mentioned above,
filing the simplified petition, the debtor may request the application of Measures.


-----

Pursuant to Article 44, paragraph 1, letter c) of the Insolvency Code, the decree setting the term for the
presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the simplified petition being declared inadmissible and, upon
request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the
adjudication of the distressed company into judicial winding-up. If the activities carried out by the debtor
company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the “full” application, the court may, ex officio,
after hearing the debtor and if appointed the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional
documents. Following the filing of the simplified petition and until the decree of admission to the composition
with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the
court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.
Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of the _concordato_
_preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) have super priority (prededucibilità) in case of a subsequent_
judicial winding-up.

In addition, pursuant to Article 99 of the Insolvency Code, new super senior indebtedness authorized by the
court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 57 of the
Insolvency Code or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to 54 of the Insolvency Code or after
the filing of the _concordato preventivo_ petition (including preliminary petition) pursuant to Article 87 of the
Insolvency Code, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business (finanza
_d’urgenza), are treated as super-senior (so called crediti prededucibili) pursuant to Article 222 of the Insolvency_
Code and the related acts, payments, guarantees and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back
action provided under Article 166 of the Insolvency Code. The company shall properly document: (i) the
purpose of the financing; (ii) that the funds cannot be obtained otherwise and; (iii) that the lack of such funds
would damage the going concern of the debtor’s business. In the same respect, Article 101, paragraph 2 of the
Insolvency Code provides that, in the event of the debtor’s subsequent admission to the judicial liquidation
procedure, the aforementioned super senior financings are not to be considered as “predeductible”
(prededucibili) when the composition with creditors’ plan or the relevant debt restructuring agreement appears,
based on an assessment to be referred to at the time of the relevant filing, to be based on false data or the
omission of relevant information or that the debtor has performed acts in fraud of creditors and the liquidator
proves that the subject who made available the facilities, at the date of disbursement, had previous knowledge of
those circumstances.

The _concordato preventivo_ proposal may also provide, _inter alia: (i) the continuation of the business by the_
debtor as going concern; or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies (concordato con
_continuità aziendale) as well as for a particular composition with creditors proceeding through which any assets_
that are no longer necessary to run the business of the company are liquidated (concordato misto). According to
Article 84, paragraph 3 of the Insolvency Code, the concordato misto qualifies as a concordato con continuità
_aziendale, regardless the “portion” of business for which going concern is envisaged. In these cases, the plan_
and the petition for the concordato preventivo must fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a
consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and
support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of
the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition
proposal was not implemented. Existing contracts, even if entered with governmental bodies, are automatically
not to be terminated by admission to procedure.

Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding
up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a
proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Under Article 100 of the Insolvency Code, a debtor who files for a concordato pursuant to Articles 44 and 87 of
the Insolvency Code based on business continuity may request the court to be authorized to pay pre-filing claims
relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent expert certifies that they are essential for business
continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors.


-----

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to
supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and schedules a specific
period of time during which creditors can express their vote. During the implementation of the proposal, the
company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is
supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the
ordinary course of business).

Article 91 of the Insolvency Code provides that, if the composition with creditors’ plan, includes an offer for the
sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third-party, the court or the
delegated judge shall order that for appropriate publicity to be given to the offer itself in order to acquire
competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions of interest are received, the court or the delegated judge,
by decree, shall order the opening of the competitive proceeding. Furthermore pursuant to Article 91, paragraph
4, the judicial decree referred above establishes the procedures for the submission of irrevocable offers,
providing that in all cases, among others, the following is ensured: (a) their comparability, (b) the requirements
for the participation of the bidders, (c) the forms and timing of access to relevant information, (d) any limits on
their use, (e) the manner in which the judicial commissioner must provide them to those who request them, (f)
the manner in which the competitive procedure is to be conducted, (g) the minimum increase in the
consideration to be provided by the subsequent offers, (h) the guarantees to be given by the bidders, (i) the
forms of publicity, and (j) the date of the hearing for the evaluation of the bids if the sale takes place before the
court. With the sale or with the assignment, whichever is earlier, to a person other than the original bidder
identified in the plan, the latter and the debtor are released from their obligations towards each other and
accordingly the debtor shall amend the proposal and plan in accordance with the outcome of the competitive
proceeding.

The concordato preventivo is voted on within the period of time scheduled by the court and must be approved
with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also
in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, or (b) the majority of the receivables admitted to
vote is reached the majority of the classes. Pursuant to Article 109, paragraph 1, of the Insolvency Code, in case
one creditor holds more than the majority of receivables admitted to voting, it is also necessary to reach majority
by headcount. The concordato preventivo is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted
in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the
_concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceedings,_
the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of
the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and
(ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by
Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of
noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders
to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured
creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive
their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market
value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote
only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. Among others, (i) the companies controlling the
debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the entity controlling the debtor, (ii) the assignees
of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment has been perfected during the year preceding the
_concordato_ and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest are excluded from voting. The court may approve the
_concordato preventivo_ (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the
majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the non-adhering creditors
would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions (in particular in comparison with the
judicial liquidation). If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the
creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a non-adhering class,
entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the _concordato preventivo_ if it deems that the relevant
creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would
otherwise be the case (including the judicial winding-up).

The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the social
contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their positive vote is
decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109, paragraph 1 of the Insolvency
Code, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred to in Article 88 of the
Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to a
judicial liquidation scenario.


-----

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 90 of the Insolvency Code provides for the possibility for creditors (except for
individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the
aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente) to the debtor’s plan within 30 days prior from the related creditors’ vote on the debtor’s plan - in a court supervised composition
with creditors proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in
particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least 30% of the unsecured claims
(crediti chirografari), considering also that such percentage is reduced to 20% in case the debtor has filed for a
composizione negoziata provided for pursuant to Article 13 of the Insolvency Code.

Differently from the general rules set out above, pursuant to Article 109 paragraph 5 of the Insolvency Code, the
composition with creditors on a going-concern basis (concordato con continuità), is approved if all the creditors’
classes vote in favor of such composition with creditors arrangement. In each class, the relevant composition
with creditors’ proposal is approved if the majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if
two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted favorably, provided that the creditors holding at least
half of the total claims of the same class have voted. In case of non-approval, Article 112, paragraph 2, of the
Insolvency Code shall apply. In this respect, it should be noted that secured creditors shall not vote if their
claims are satisfied in cash, in full, within 180 days from the sanctioning (omologa) of the concordato con
continuità and provided that the security interests supporting the related claims remains firm until the windingup, functional to their satisfaction. In case of claims of employees or other claims secured under Article 2751bis of the Italian Civil Code, the delay is reduced to 30 days from the approval by the court.

Pursuant to Article 112, paragraph 5 of the Insolvency Code, after the approval of the concordato preventivo
proposal, non-adhering creditors (or creditors belonging to a non-adhering class) representing 20% or more of
the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione), challenging the economic convenience of the plan. In such
case, the court has the authority to “cram-down” non-adhering creditors, compelling their acceptance of the
plan, if it deems that the proposed treatment of their claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a judicial
winding-up scenario. After the creditors’ approval, the court approves the composition with creditors and
appoints one or more liquidators in order to execute the approved plan if it has to be realized by way of a
transfer of assets. The court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the
debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required.

Pursuant to Article 111 of the Insolvency Code, if the creditors do not approve the concordato preventivo, the
delegated judge (giudice delegato) shall promptly inform the court which, having decided that the appropriate
conditions apply, shall declare the opening of the judicial winding-up proceeding.

The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to time, by
the debtor are not automatically affected by the _concordato preventivo_ proceeding and normally continue
pending the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to Article 97 of the
Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding
agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti) if the continuation of such agreements is
inconsistent with the prospects and the execution of the composition with creditors’ plan, except for certain
agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti
_di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita_
_aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di_
_immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the_
_concordato preventivo_ or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the
procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time (a)
between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible
further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or
in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are pending, renewable just once. When the
composition proposal together with the relevant plan have been submitted, the suspension may also be
authorized by the court for a further duration, which, however, may not exceed thirty days from the date of the
decree opening the procedure, which may not be further extended. In such circumstances, the other party has the
right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement.
Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the _concordato preventivo_
procedure.

Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition with
creditors plan or fraud, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the _concordato_ can be terminated or
annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the creditors and the judicial winding-up may


-----

follow, at the behest of the relevant court. if the composition with creditors is implemented, terms and
conditions of payments are amended as per the _concordato_ proposal, and the debtor may return to its usual
operations (if the assets of the company are still in his possession). Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all
creditors prior to the publication of the application in the companies’ register. However, creditors retain without
prejudice their rights against co-debtors and guarantors of the debtor.

In case of non-minor breaches, the _concordato_ may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial
commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought within
one year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself.
The concordato may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or of one or more creditors in
case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities have been willfully exaggerated.
The relevant lawsuit must be brought within six months from the discovery of the concealment/exaggeration
and, in any event, within two years from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out
under the concordato itself.

**_Available financing forms under the Insolvency Code_**

The enactment of the Insolvency Code did not change the main features of the previous legal framework set out
in the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The aim at preserving the value of the company as a going concern and
maximizing creditor’s repayment are the main goals both of the previous legal framework and the Insolvency
Code.

However, the new provisions under the Insolvency Code remove some uncertainties and clarifies some debated
issues.

In addition, the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law focused mainly on the perspective of creditors
already having claims against the company to avoid that the expectations of recovery of such claims were
reduced due to the potential considerable increase in predeductible claims and, to this extent, granted a
preeminent role to the independent expert together with the court authorization procedures. Unlike the former
legal framework, the new provisions of the Insolvency Code focus more on preserving the business value of the
distressed company as a going concern by strengthening the key role of the financing of the debtor in the context
of the relevant proceedings.

The provision of Article 99 of the Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the
court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo).

The main features of the provisions concerning different available financings under the Insolvency Code are set
out below.

**_Interim financing - Article 99 Paragraph 1 to 4 Insolvency Code_**

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring transactions
on a going concern basis, also in cases in which business continuity is maintained exclusively in a view of
liquidation, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to
Article 57 (or Article 60 or 61) of the Insolvency Code or a petition pursuant to Article 87 of the Insolvency
Code (in relation to the court-supervised composition with creditors procedure described below) may authorize
the debtor, if so expressly requested to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness,
subject to the court’s authorization with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that:
(i) the petition specifies (A) the purpose of the financing; (B) that the debtor is unable to otherwise obtain the
required funds and (C) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to
the going concern or to the proceedings; and (ii) the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall
financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing are
functional to the continuity of the business activities until the sanctioning (omologa) of the relevant insolvency
proceedings or to the opening of the proceedings or to conduct them and, in any case, are aimed at providing a
better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors. The expert report is not necessary in case the court recognizes
that there is the urgent need to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern. In the event of
the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the
aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the petition or
the expert report contain false data or omit important information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud


-----

of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such
financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

**_Bridge Financings - Article 99 Paragraph 5 Insolvency Code_**

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 5, of the Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related claims)
granted, in any form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a
debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) (finanza
_ponte), may be granted such priority status provided that (i) they meet the requirements of Article 99,_
paragraphs 1 and 2 (described above), and (ii) it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such
priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the _concordato preventivo. The_
indebtedness under such financing option may be secured, subject to the court’s authorization, with in rem
security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims.

**_Implementation financing - Article 101 Insolvency Code_**

In restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, pursuant to Article 101 of the Insolvency Code, any
financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-judicial
liquidation composition with creditors) sanctioned by the competent court and expressly provided for in the
relevant plan, enjoy super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent judicial liquidation, save
for the below (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such
financing, unless the lender has become a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring
agreement or of the supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors, as in such case the priority status is
afforded to 100% of the financing) according with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of Insolvency Code. In
the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione
_giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case_
the composition plan or the debt restructuring agreement, on the basis of an assessment to be made at the time of
the relevant filing, results to be based upon false data or omission of relevant information or in case the debtor
performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made
available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

**_The shareholders’ financing – Art. 102 Insolvency Code_**

Pursuant to Art. 102, Paragraph 1 of the Insolvency Code super senior ranking status also applies to any
financings made available by shareholders in any form (including any guarantee facility or granting counterindemnities) up to 80% of their amount.

Paragraph 2 of Article 102 of the Insolvency Code clarifies that, to the extent the financing is made available by
an entity becoming a shareholder in the context of and by way of implementation of a composition with
creditors or debt restructuring agreement, all the claims deriving from such financings benefit of super senior
ranking status and the 80% threshold limitation set out in Paragraph 1 does not apply.

**_Super senior ranking - Art. 99 Paragraph 6 and 101 Paragraph 2 Corporate Crisis and Insolvency Code_**

Super senior ranking (prededucibilità) of the claims is the most relevant feature of bridge financings, interim
financings and implementation financings as described in the paragraphs above.

Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings are expressly
qualified as super senior by law and by Article 6(2) of the Insolvency Code which clarifies that their super
senior ranking natures continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency or enforcement proceedings
(including in a judicial liquidation or any so-called minor proceedings).

As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of acts of
fraud (which may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements).

Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings on the
one side and for the implementation financings on the other side.


-----

More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant information are
relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the attestation of the
independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are relevant when on included in plan
underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement.

With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 Paragraph 6 of the Insolvency Code
provides that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although authorized by the court
in the context of the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement) do not benefit from super
senior ranking when it is proved (jointly) that:

    - the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information, or
when the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization; and

    - the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew the
aforementioned circumstances.

With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101 Paragraph 2 of
the Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super senior ranking, in case of the
opening of a judicial liquidation (alternatively):

    - when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of the
proceeding, the plan underlying the composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement
turns out to be based on false data or on the omission of relevant information; or

    - when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the
lenders providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the establishment
of the financings.

Restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)

An important novelty concerns the crisis regulation procedures governed by Title IV of Part I of the Insolvency
Code, is the new figure of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad
_omologazione) (the so-called “PRO”, the rules of which are set out in the new Articles 64-bis and 64-ter of the_
Insolvency Code).

This new tool takes the form of a restructuring framework that may disregard the distribution rules of regular
insolvency proceedings but can be enacted provided that strict requirements are met. In this regard, it should be
noted that recourse to this instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or insolvent that plans to satisfy its
creditors by dividing them into classes according to homogeneous legal positions and economic interests. This
instrument allows the plan’s proceeds to be distributed even in derogation of the principle of “par condicio
creditorum” (i.e., the equal treatment of creditors), provided that the proposal is approved by unanimous consent
of the classes. A judgement of admissibility is provided for by the court, which is called upon to assess the
proposal’s timeliness and to verify the correctness of the class formation criteria.

Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common
framework applicable to all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e., concordato preventivo, debt restructuring
agreement and also to judicial winding-up). The regulation of the restructuring plan subject to homologation
(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), from the date of submission of the application until its
approval, is based on the model of the negotiated crisis settlement: the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and
extraordinary management of the company in the prevailing interest of the creditors under the supervision of the
court commissioner. The debtor is, in any case, allowed to amend the application at any time, formulating the
proposal of composition (concordato preventivo). In that case, the time limit for approval is shortened.
Similarly, the debtor that has filed an application for composition with creditors may amend the application by
applying for approval of the restructuring plan provided that the application is made before voting commences.
In each class, the proposal is approved if a majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if
two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted in favor, provided that creditors holding at least half
of the total claims of the same class have voted. The court will approve the restructuring plan in the event of
approval by all classes. If a dissenting creditor objects to the proposal, the court will approve and homologate
the restructuring plan if the proposal satisfies the claim to a not lesser extent than the one resulting from a
judicial liquidation. A creditor that has not objected to the lack of convenience in its observations may not file


-----

an objection referred before, unless it proves such the lack of objection was due to a cause not attributable to it.
In summary the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)
thus represents for the debtor an opportunity instrument which minimizes the admissibility phase, providing
greater freedom of action, but requiring the approval of all classes of creditors in order to be effectively
approved.

Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to homologation
(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court of
appeal within the term of 30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court.

**_Court-supervised composition for small debtors_**

The Insolvency Code provides for a simplified court-supervised composition in case the debtor does not meet
the dimensional requirements to access other restructuring tools.

Procedural steps and effects do essentially mimic those of the concordato preventivo, but it entails the
involvement of the board for crisis settlement (organismo di risoluzione della crisi), which assists the debtor in
preparing the paperwork and filing the petition, and performs the activities and duties which, in a concordato
_preventivo are prerogatives of the judicial commissioner._

**_Judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale)_**

The judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of an
insolvent company’s assets and for the distribution of the related proceeds. It results in the company’s
liquidation. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2 of the Insolvency Code, also evidenced by defaults and/or
external elements, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due.

The judicial winding-up is declared by the competent court and is applicable only to commercial enterprises
(imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii)_
has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three
preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million.
Pursuant to Article 37 of the Insolvency Code, the request to commence the judicial liquidation of the debtor
company’s assets can be filed by (i) the debtor company itself, (ii) the administrative bodies and authorities that
have control and supervisory functions over the company, (iii) by one or more of the debtor’s creditors and (iv)
in certain cases, by the public prosecutor.

Upon the commencement of judicial winding-up proceedings, amongst other things:

    - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed, and creditors must file claims
within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce
against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as secured claims. Secured claims
are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any
outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other
unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained
authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the judicial receiver and
the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth
the timing in its decision;

    - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as
their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of
liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant
expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits,
any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s
other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court
authorization. After hearing the judicial receiver (curatore) and the creditors’ committee, the court
decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision;

    - the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made
or received by the insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third parties


-----

that have been carried out after the declaration of insolvency are not effective as regards the
creditors of the debtor (Article 145 of Insolvency Code);

    - the debtor is dispossessed, and the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets
are transferred to the judicial receiver (curatore). The debtor may no longer validly act in court as
claimant or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 142 of the Insolvency Code). The judicial
receiver is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated judge. However, all
pending proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from the date the
adjudication is issued and need to be re-initiated by or against the judicial receiver;

    - the beginning of the judicial winding-up involves the cessation of all the activities of the company
with a view to a sale of all assets. However, continuation of business may be authorized by the
court if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors. If the
competent court authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa),
the management of the business is entrusted to the judicial receiver (who may in turn avail himself
of qualified third parties for this purpose);

    - certain payments made, security interests given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a
certain period before the debtor’s submission to a judicial winding-up procedure (varying from six
months to two years) can be set aside and clawed back if certain conditions are met (provided for
pursuant to Article 166 of the Insolvency Code);

    - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in
certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other
than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

    - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the insolvency
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the
general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where
some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are
subject to specific rules expressly provided for the Insolvency Code.

In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written
petition requiring the Court to give the judicial receiver (curatore) a deadline of no more than 60 days; within
such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the
deadline without the judicial receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is
deemed terminated. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to terminate contracts
where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules
expressly provided for by the Insolvency Code.

Judicial winding-up proceedings, as per the former bankruptcy proceedings under Italian Bankruptcy Law, are
carried out and supervised by a court-appointed judicial receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a
creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The judicial receiver is not a representative of the creditors and is
responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the
liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a
considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate property.

Furthermore, the parties of a judicial winding-up proceeding as well as any interested party, may file an appeal
(opposizione) to the decree closing the judicial winding-up proceeding within 30 days after having been notified
of the same.

**_Composition with creditors in judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale)_**

Pursuant to Article 240 of the Insolvency Code, judicial liquidation proceedings can terminate prior to the actual
judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) of the debtor, through a proposal for a composition with creditors in
judicial liquidation. By way of preliminary note, such agreement occurring in the context of a judicial
liquidation proceeding (i) replaced the former proceeding defined as “concordato fallimentare”, a composition
with creditors agreement occurring in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento) formerly provided for
under Article 124, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (ii) should be kept distinct from the


-----

_concordato preventivo, which is an independent insolvency proceeding. This particular composition with_
creditor agreement arrangement benefits in a certain way both the debtor as well as the creditors, in fact while
the former is released of the debts falling into the relevant plan also regaining free disposal of his assets, the
latter is satisfied faster and to a greater extent than they would have been with the full completion of the judicial
liquidation process pertaining to the debtor’s assets.

The creditor, a third-party or the debtor himself formulates a proposal having as its object a “plan” to satisfy
creditors, including preferential creditors, in full or in part. In case the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale
is proposed by the debtor, such proposal, inter alia, (i) shall be filed after 1 year from the opening of the judicial
liquidation proceeding and (ii) shall provide for the contribution by the debtor of resources that increase the
value of the debtor’s assets by at least 10%.

Such proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, shall then be approved by the creditors and finally by
the court. In case the court’s decree approving the _concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale_ becomes final
(definitivo), the court declares the judicial liquidation to be closed and terminated, initiating the enactment phase
of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale. In the context of a concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale, the
competent court supervises both the proposal and execution phases while the judicial receiver (curatore), once
the liquidation is closed, loses his management functions and retains only supervisory duties over the fulfillment
of the terms and the conditions of the arrangement obligations arising from or in connection with the
aforementioned concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale.

Pursuant to Article 240, paragraph 2 of the Insolvency Code, the proposal may provide for:

    - the division of creditors into classes, according to homogeneous legal position and economic
interests. Under the relevant provision, such division is not mandatory but discretionary, provided
two criteria for the class identification: (a) legal position, i.e., the nature of the claim, e.g.,
unsecured or preferential and (b) the homogeneous economic interests. In this respect, the
Insolvency Code requires for the criteria and rationale for the division into classes to be expressly
stated in order to avoid the distorted use of class formation, put in place for the sole purpose of
obtaining the approval of the abovementioned proposal;

    - differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the reasons of
such differences;

    - the restructuring of the financial indebtedness of the debtor as well as the satisfaction of claims in
any form possible, by way of example:

    - by assignment of assets; by assumption (accollo);

    - by means of other extraordinary transactions, including the assignment to creditors (as well as to
companies in which they have an interest), of shares, quotas or bonds, including those convertible
into shares or other financial instruments and debt securities.

It should be noted that a special feature of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is the option to provide
that secured creditors may not be satisfied in full. However, it is necessary for the plan to provide for their
satisfaction to a non-lesser extent than that the one which can be realized, by reason of preferential placement,
from the relevant proceeds in the event of a judicial liquidation, having regard to the market value attributable to
the assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption exists.

The _concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale_ proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the
creditors holding the simple majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of
the claims in the majority of the classes). However, in the event of dissent by more than one creditor’s class, a
cram-down may occur (i.e., in case the court decides to approve the concordato - despite a creditor belonging to
a dissenting class contests the appropriateness of the proposal - if it finds that the claims can be satisfied by the
_concordato_ to a non-lesser extent than the practicable alternatives). Final court confirmation and sanctioning
(omologazione) is also required.

Finally, once approved and sanctioned (omologato) by the court the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is
mandatory:


-----

    - for all existing creditors prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding; and

    - for creditors who have not applied for the admission to the judicial liquidation estate, to whom the
guarantees or the security interests given in the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale by third
parties do not extend.

With the termination of the judicial liquidation - as a consequence of the sanctioning decree (decreto di
_omologa), which pursuant to Article 247 of the Insolvency Code may be challenged and appealed within 30_
days from its notification - the debtor returns “in bonis” and enjoys the renewed availability of its assets.

    - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Insolvency Code may**
be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU
jurisdictions. The proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i)
for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such
as costs related to the procedure) as better identified in Article 6 of the Insolvency Code; (ii) for
payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the
payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the
costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a
claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims
of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages.
The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors
(creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively,
provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly,
unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the
debtor’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court
can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by
subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence
it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor
contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian judicial liquidation estate to the
extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of
claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire
debtor’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

In particular, pursuant to Article 6 of the Insolvency Code, in addition to claims expressly qualified as
“prededucibili” under Italian law, among others, the following claims are “prededucibili”:

(i) claims relating to expenses and fees for services rendered by the business crisis settlement
body;

(ii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing for the approval of a
restructuring plan subject to homologation, the debt restructuring agreements and for the
application for protective measures, to the extent of 75% of the assessed claim and provided
that the abovementioned plan or agreements are approved and homologated;

(iii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing of for a court supervised
composition with creditors procedure as well as the filing of the related proposal and the plan
accompanying it, within the limits of 75% of the ascertained claims and provided that the
proceedings are opened pursuant to Article 47 of the Insolvency Code; and

(iv) claims legally arisen in connection with insolvency proceedings for the management of the
debtor’s assets and the continuation of the business of the company as well as arising from the
professional services required by the related bodies.

    - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Insolvency Code is the equal**
treatment of all creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent statutory
priorities or security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim than other
creditors. A consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by the judicial
receiver is strictly regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over the previous
year (or, in certain cases, over the previous six months) are scrutinized and potentially unwound as
preferential.


-----

Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may
give rise, _inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor_
prior to the declaration of insolvency. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions
made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors.
Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in judicial
winding-up compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In insolvency proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back
period of up to two years (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain
other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back
period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Insolvency Code distinguishes between
acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the
request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

    - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 163 of the Insolvency Code, subject to**
certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening
of the judicial winding-up procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such
insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article
163 of the Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon
registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without
needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any
interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law,
and (ii) under Article 164 of the Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the
day of the of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were
executed by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up
proceeding or in the prior two-year period; and (B) payments made by the debtor with respect to
any intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or after the
filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective
vis-à-vis creditors.

    - **Acts that may be avoided at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner. The**
following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed
back (revocati) vis-à-vis the debtor as provided for by Article 166 of the Insolvency Code and be
declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive
knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

(i) onerous transactions carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial
liquidation proceeding or in the previous year, where the value of the debt or the
obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration
received by and/or promised to the debtor;

(ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor which were not paid in cash or
by other customary means of payment which were carried out after the filing followed by
the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year;

(iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of
the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the year prior, in order to secure pre-existing
debts which were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and

(iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of
the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the six months prior in order to secure preexisting debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted.

Furthermore, payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions and/or
granting of priority rights/security interests for debts simultaneously created (event those of third-parties) may
be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective, if the judicial receiver proves that the other party knew of
the debtor’s state of insolvency and if made by the debtor after the filing of the petition followed by the opening
of the judicial liquidation or during the prior six months.


-----

The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

(i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market
practice;

(ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce
the entity’s debt towards the bank;

(iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian
Civil Code, in force as the date of this offering memorandum, made for a fair value and
concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the
purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is
intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the
insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the
commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made or guarantees granted with respect to the debtor’s
goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano attestato di risanamento (see
“Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of
_the Insolvency Code” above);_

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interests granted in the
context of a court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), of a
restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad
_omologazione) provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Insolvency Code or of sanctioned_
debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati)
and/or transactions entered into, payments made and security interests legitimately granted by
the debtor after the filing of the application for a concordato preventivo or of an accordo di
ristrutturazione dei debiti (see above);

(vi) remuneration payments to the entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out
by them; and

(vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to
services necessary for access to a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring framework (see below
under “pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi
_e dell’insolvenza della società)”) or to other insolvency procedures provided for pursuant to_
the Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 170 of the Insolvency Code, the limitation period for initiating claw-back action proceedings
is three years from the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or, if earlier, five years from the act or
transaction to be clawed back. In case judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a petition to be
admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Insolvency Code, the
suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such petition is filed. In addition, in certain cases,
the judicial receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor be declared ineffective within the ordinary
claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article
2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the debtor disposed of its assets
prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the
debtor was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim
was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of
prejudicing the creditors) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third party,
the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which
the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely
with the receiver.

The Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra-group transactions. Under
Article 290 of the Insolvency Code the limitation period of initiating intra-group claw-back actions (referring to
acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the creditors’
interest) is extended to five years from the filing for judicial winding-up declaration.


-----

Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code provided for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with
respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from
the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can start enforcement proceedings over the relevant
assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent)
transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous
transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”).
In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the thirdparty purchaser. Finally, as noted above, the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which
replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the
European Union.

 - **_Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures. One of the main novelties_**
included in the Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the organizational, administrative and
accounting structures of a company which are deemed to be adequate under Article 2086 of the Italian
Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for the purpose of timely detection of the state of crisis
and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by the debtor. Article 3 of the Insolvency Code requires the
entrepreneur to adopt an appropriate organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of the Italian
Civil Code, for the purpose of timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely
undertaking of suitable initiatives to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither
the aforementioned Article 3, in its current wording, nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as amended
by the Insolvency Code, contains a precise description of the parameters, conditions and characteristics
that are deemed to be necessary/needed for the definition and especially for the identification of “adequate
structures.”

In this regard, Article 3 of the Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the purposes to
which the measures and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate for the timely detection
of the crisis and, on the other hand, the relevant warning signs in relation to the same. In this respect, it is
stipulated that, for the purpose of the timely detection of the company’s state of crisis, the measures and
structures deemed to be adequate should make it possible to:

(i) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific
characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor;

(ii) verify the non-sustainability of debts and the absence of prospects for business continuity for
the next twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph 4 of the
Insolvency Code; and

(iii) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical test
for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery.

For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3, paragraph 4 of the
Insolvency Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs, identified, inter alia, as follows:

(i) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the total
monthly payroll amount;

(ii) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an amount
greater than the amount of receivables that are not past due;

(iii) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past due
for more than 60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any form for at
least 60 days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the total exposures;
and

(iv) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article 25novies of the Insolvency Code.

**_Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi_**
**_imprese in stato di insolvenza)_**

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial
enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, a company
must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200
employees in the year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds
of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services
during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court
or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for judicial winding-up proceedings with respect to existing
contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential
payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business
activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an
administrative phase.

**_Judicial Phase_**

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is
insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario
_giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization._
The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within 10 days from such filing, the
Ministry of the Economic Development (the “Ministry”) may release an opinion on the admission of the
company to the extraordinary administration proceeding. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing
of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. The judicial receiver
submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic
Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure
or place it into judicial winding-up.

**_Administrative Phase_**

If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and
the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide
either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the
“Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two
years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors
(concordato preventivo). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the
extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months
on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure
ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail,
the company will be declared insolvent.

**_Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato_**
**_di insolvenza)_**

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law
No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is
complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The
Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company
must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the judicial phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least
500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300.0 million of debt (including
those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry
following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The
Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary
commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a
Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be
completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery


-----

Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company insolvent and open judicial winding-up
proceedings.

Unlike in the _Prodi-bis_ procedure, in the _Marzano_ procedure the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate
claw-back actions also if a Recovery Plan is approved, provided that this results in a material benefit for the
creditors.

**_Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_**

A compulsory administrative winding up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), provided for pursuant to Article
293 and ff. of the Insolvency Code, is only available for public interest entities such as state-controlled
companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound
up pursuant to judicial liquidation proceedings, save for a different indication under Italian law. It is irrelevant
whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is a
special sort of insolvency proceeding in which the entity is liquidated not by the court, but by the relevant
administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered
not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly provided for by the
relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of
the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this
procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed
to wind up the company by the relevant administrative authority. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a
steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the court under
the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The
effect on creditors of the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under insolvency proceedings
and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings
with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration
proceedings.

**_Common rules for pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e_**
**_dell’insolvenza della società)_**

In order to facilitate access and filing of restructuring procedures by the Italian companies, Articles 120-bis and
ff. of the Insolvency Code have been enacted, introducing a set of rules applicable to all pre-judicial liquidation
restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza). Among other things, pursuant to
Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the Insolvency Code and the purposes of a successful restructuring, the plan may
provide for “any modification of the articles of association of the debtor company, including capital increases
and reductions, including with limitation or exclusion of the option right and other modifications that directly
affect the shareholders’ participation rights, as well as for mergers, demergers and transformations.”
Shareholders, who may no longer have an interest in the company, are prevented from hindering the
restructuring or even one of its stages. For this reason, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the
Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while retaining a right to information in relation to both the initiation and the
progress of the restructuring process, may not remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for the
statutory auditors of joint stock companies, also in light of the fact that under the provisions of the Insolvency
Code it is not considered as being just cause for directors’ removal, the filing for access to the pre-judicial
liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) when the related legal
conditions and requirements are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 5, shareholders
representing at least 10% of the filing company’s corporate capital may make a competing proposal.

The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are shareholders
to whom different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes provided for in the plan.
The formation of classes is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for changes that directly affect the
shareholders’ participation rights and, in any case, for large companies and companies with widespread capital.
In this context, special conditions for approval of the arrangement are set out pursuant to Article 120-quater of
the Insolvency Code when and if the plan provides for shareholder attributions. Specific rules are then provided
to ensure that creditors’ interests are protected in all cases in which the restructuring tool envisages shareholders
to retain a participation in the company with a certain value.

Article 120-quinquies of the Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure. In order to avoid
any obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring tool, this provision
expressly excludes the necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the implementation of such restructuring


-----

tool, by generally attributing the relevant powers to the directors or more specifically to the competent court, in
relation to any amendment to the debtor’s by-laws which - being specifically provided for by the plan - do not
require any discretionary resolution. Finally, it is stipulated that changes in the corporate structure resulting from
the implementation of a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
_dell’insolvenza) shall not be considered as and constitute cause for the termination or amendment of any_
agreement entered into by the debtor with third parties.

Articles 284 and ff. of the Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a group to one of
the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) aiming at
unifying – to the extent possible – the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability lawsuits available to the receiver; and
(iii) subordination of claims.

**_Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_**

In a judicial winding-up proceeding, the Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up to two years
(six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that certain
transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of
five years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency
proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any
future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or
by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back
(revocatoria) provided for pursuant to the Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified suspect period. The
avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within the suspect period of one year prior to the
opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial
liquidation, at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one
quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g.,
payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is
entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no
knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted during
the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the
filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the
non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was
entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken
simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of one year prior to the
opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial
liquidation, if the judicial receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. In case
judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings,
according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from
the date in which such petition is filed. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those
contemplated by a Guarantor’s Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by
a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees
or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and
any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to
recover any amounts under the related Security Documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 163 of the Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exceptions, all
transactions carried out by the debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors if entered into by
the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up procedure or
within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction
which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by
operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding,
without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested
person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164
of the Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration of
opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application
followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up proceedings insolvency declaration or in the prior two-year


-----

period; and B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a
judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up
proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors.

In addition, as noted above, the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the
various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European
Union.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

_The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Italy. The documents relating to the Collateral will be governed by_
_the laws of Italy and any jurisdiction where the Collateral is located. The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes_
_Guarantees (if any) will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by the_
_laws of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the_
_United States. Because substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its and their directors and executive_
_officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or_
_any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium_
_(if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S._
_federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer_
_will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York_
_courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S._
_securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as_
_mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability_
_provisions of U.S. federal securities laws or other laws against us or on such other persons as mentioned above_
_in the courts of foreign jurisdiction. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other_
_jurisdictions (including Italy) upon those persons or the Issuer provided that, for example, The Hague_
_Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of_
_November 15, 1965 is complied with._

_If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such judgment in_
_jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments_
_outside the United States is described below for the countries in which the Issuer is located, you should consult_
_with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or_
_elsewhere outside the United States._

At the current stage there is no international convention and/or bilateral treaty into force between the United
States and Italy providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration
awards) in civil and commercial matters.

Notwithstanding the above, recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts,
including judgments obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state
securities laws, does not require re-examination of the merit of the case and will be enforceable in Italy,
provided that pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di
_diritto internazionale privato), among others, the following conditions are met:_

- the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction upon the relevant matter according to
Italian law principles of jurisdiction;

- the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with U.S.
law and during the proceedings the essential rights of defence of the defendant have not been violated;

- the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of
defendant party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with
U.S. law;

- the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;

- there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

- there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which
commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

- the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, in case of non-compliance with or
objection to the recognition of a U.S. judgement or when it is necessary to proceed with forceful enforcement,


-----

any interested person may apply to the Court of Appeal of the place of implementation for a determination of
the existence of the recognition prerequisites above. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the
merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set out above. The U.S.
judgment, jointly with the decision allowing the application referred to above, constitutes entitlement to the
implementation and forceful enforcement. If the objection to the U.S. judgment is raised in the context of other
proceedings pending in Italy, the decision on the objection is made by the relevant Italian judge with effects
limited to those proceedings only.

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the
U.S. federal or state securities law is debatable. If an original action is brought before an Italian court, the Italian
court may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law
that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies
sought (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory
provisions of Italian law.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Multiversity Group (the Group), which
comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the income statements and
statements of cash flows for the years then ended, and explanatory notes.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position
of the Group as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and of its financial performance and its cash flows
for the years then ended in accordance with the Italian regulations governing financial statements.

###### Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the
_Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the_
Multiversity S.p.A. in accordance with the regulations and standards on ethics and independence
applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

###### Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a
true and fair view in accordance with the Italian regulations governing financial statements, and,
within the terms provided by the law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

The Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern and, when preparing the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriateness of the
going concern assumption, and for appropriate disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the
consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis unless they either intend to liquidate the
parent Multiversity S.p.A. or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The statutory audit committee (“Collegio Sindacale”) is responsible, within the terms provided by the
law, for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

###### Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated
financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have
exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In
addition:
� we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
� we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;
� we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors;
� we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this matter in forming our opinion. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going
concern;
� we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated
financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.
� we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of
the entities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as
required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
