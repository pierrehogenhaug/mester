These Non-GAAP Measures are based on a number of complex assumptions and have not been subject to audit or review. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates and key performance indicators are reasonable, there are inherent challenges in measuring such information. The conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, and as a result, the assumptions and estimates upon which the Non-GAAP Measures are based may not be correct. For these reasons, Non-GAAP Measures used should not be considered as an alternative to profit (loss), revenue or any other performance measure derived in accordance with Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting principles nor to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as analytical tools over and above the limitations of any accounting principles performance measures and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Group’s results as reported under Italian GAAP. Such Non-GAAP measures may include or xiv ----- exclude amounts that are included or excluded, as applicable, in the calculation of the most directly comparable measures in accordance with Italian GAAP. Their usefulness is therefore subject to limitations, which are described below. In particular, other companies in the industry may define the Non-GAAP measures used herein, differently, which may make it difficult to compare the performance of these entities to the Multiversity performance based on similarly named measures. These measures may be used by different companies for different purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. In addition, the exclusion of certain items from Non-GAAP measures does not imply that these items are necessarily nonrecurring. From time to time, we may exclude additional items if we believe doing so would result in a more transparent and comparable disclosure. You should exercise caution in comparing this data to similar measures used by other companies. The information presented has not been prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and will not be subject to review by the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of this information. These measures are not measurements of performance under Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting principles and you should not consider them as an alternative to profit/(loss) before taxes or profit/(loss) from continuing operations determined in accordance with Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting principles, or, as the case may be, or to cash flows from/(used in) operating activities, cash used in investing activities or cash flow from/(used in) financing activities. These measures are not indicative of our historical operating results, nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. Therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on this data. Non-GAAP Measures should be considered in conjunction with the Multiversity Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP. Although certain of these measures have been extracted or derived from the Multiversity Consolidated Financial Statements, this data has not been audited or reviewed by the Multiversity Group’s independent auditors. These non-GAAP measures and ratios relate to Multiversity.

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,General,"Multiversity is the market leader in Italy in the e-learning market by number of enrolled students with a 40% market share of the Italian online undergraduate higher education market for the 2019/2020 academic year capturing approximately 3% of the total Italian undergraduate market.[1] It operates two private online universities, Pegaso and Mercatorum, a certification entity, Certipass and a number of academies as well as an international lifelong learning higher education institution based in Malta. It delivers its services through a proprietary online platform that carries out the e-learning contents produced in-house. Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A., held by Multiversity, is the promoter and supporter of Pegaso, Multiversity’s primary education institution. Approximately 105,000 students were enrolled in one of Pegaso’s online courses for the 2020-2021 academic year. Pegaso offers a range of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses, and in particular, seven undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single cycle five-year degree and 139 postgraduate master’s courses as well as a number of higher education and specialization courses for professionals and high school graduates. Pegaso also offers six individual certifications and gives students the possibility to undertake single examinations for each course module upon payment of a fee without having to complete the full course. Multiversity’s other key institution, Mercatorum, is held indirectly by Multiversity through its 66.66% stake in the share capital of Unimercatorum S.r.l. as the promoter and supporter of Mercatorum, with the remaining 33.33% stake in Unimercatorum S.r.l. is held indirectly by Unioncamere. Unioncamere, the Italian Union of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and Agriculture, is the public body that unites and institutionally represents the Italian system of chambers of commerce. Approximately 23,000 students were enrolled in Mercatorum for the 2020-2021 academic year. Mercatorum’s core offering currently consists of 14 undergraduate bachelor’s degrees (two of which are newly accredited and are therefore being offered for the first time in the 2021/2022 academic year), four specialist master’s degrees, one Ph.D. and 11 postgraduate master’s courses. Like Pegaso, it also allows students to undertake single examinations for any course module offered within its curricula. Other assets of Multiversity include Certipass, as provider of international certifications for digital competences and IT skills, and an ever-growing number of academies established through collaboration agreements between Pegaso and Mercatorum and their respective commercial partners, covering a wide range of specialist subjects such as marketing, communications and media and teaching.

Apart from the Postgraduate School in Legal Professions (as further described below), Principe di Napoli is one of the few institution within Multiversity to hold on premise courses. Multiversity also operates a publishing entity and companies dedicated to research, which are mostly ancillary and in support of the two universities. Almost the entirety of its operations are located in Italy, with some limited operations in Malta. It also has collaboration agreements with several partners in Italy for the development and delivery of specialized courses in a multitude of subjects, made available through its two universities. 1 In terms of number of enrolled students (source: Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), source MIUR data (extraction @6/2019), Third Party Commercial Advisor). 1 ----- Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €188.7 million, as compared to €138.8 million[2] for the prior financial year (an increase of 36%), while Multiversity’s revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were €133.8 million, as compared to €98.1 million in the same period of the prior financial year (an increase of 36%).

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1215,MERCATORUM,1215.1,Competitive Strengths,1215.1.1,"Education and training is a large, resilient, underpenetrated market with strong fundamentals, particularly in online segment","Global education and training is a large market, currently valued at over $5.0 trillion[6], and it is expected to grow steadily across the whole spectrum, given significant white space and the need for re-skilling of a significant portion of global population, mainly due to the digital evolution and the new competencies required (“Lifelong Learning”). Online education still represents a relatively small portion overall of the larger global education market, with an estimated global online penetration of 3.6%[7] in 2020. However, the online education segment has and is expected to continue to show strong growth, having outpaced traditional physical education growth in recent years whilst progressively gaining market share and unlocking unaddressed areas of demand. This growth is expected to continue, and in particular subcategories such as higher education, supplemental business–to-consumer (“B2C”) and corporate training are expected to accelerate on the back of COVID-19, which has hastened the adoption of online learning and resulted in an acceleration of online academic offerings. The global education market as a whole has historically grown at a slow but steady pace and has proven resilient[8] through economic cycles, including the financial crisis. Future growth in this market is expected to be supported by several strong structural trends, including: (i) continued student population growth globally and economic expansion; (ii) a growing professional class willing to supplement formal education; (iii) rising levels of participation in education; (iv) the need for employee re-skilling and (v) global investments to further advance education and digitalization. Undergraduate enrollment in Italy has proven resilient over time, displaying a counter cyclical correlation with economic cycles and historically experiencing an increase in enrollments during economic downturns.[9] Online universities have been the main contributor to the growth in undergraduate enrollment since they began operating in the Italian market in 2006. More recently, the number of Italian first-timers (new university students who have never been enrolled in university programs) and total students enrolled both maintained their growth[10], in spite of the adverse impact to Italian GDP as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Italy, the overall undergraduate market—encompassing both traditional and online programs—grew steadily at a 1% CAGR[11] over the past four years, reaching a total of 1.8 million students in the 2019-2020 academic year, with enrolment expected to surpass the 2.0 million mark by the 2025-2026 academic year.

Similar trends are expected to continue, with the online segment anticipated to grow at an annual growth rate of 19% from the 2019/2020 through the 2025/2026 academic years, driving overall market growth even as enrolment at traditional universities is expected to remain flat. A lower percentage of degree holders and a gap in digital skills versus other industrialized peers means that Italy has the potential to benefit disproportionately from these trends as it seeks to close the gap—both in terms of education and digitalization—versus its European peers. Italy stands at 27.7%[12] (vs. 44.9% for OECD) in terms of average population holding a degree and ranks fourth to last versus other developed countries in the DESI digitalization index[13]. The higher education and skills gaps vis-à-vis populations in peer nations represent a significant growth opportunity for online education in Italy, and in particular those programs specializing in digital skills training. Due to its aging workforce, Italy is also expected to require a large number of graduates across multiple disciplines in the next five years, totalling nearly 900,000 in expected new hires according to Unioncamere[14]. Specifically with respect to the disciplines in which Multiversity focuses, the expected need over this period is for approximately 120,000 graduates in Economics & Business Administration, 120,000 in Engineering, 105,000 in Teaching and Training and 90,000 in Law. _Demand for graduates in the Italian job market_ The postgraduate market has grown even faster than the undergraduate market, experiencing a CAGR of 17% from the 2015/2016 to the 2019/2020 academic years and reaching 96,000 students in the 2019/2020 academic year. Over the same period, growth in online postgraduate enrollment, which already exceeds that of traditional channels, was a CAGR of 30%. Postgraduate growth is expected to continue at a double-digit CAGR through the 2025/2026 academic year, driven primarily by the continued increase in the adoption of online education. In addition to these secular long-term trends, growth in the online undergraduate and postgraduate education markets, which comprise the Multiversity Group’s core addressable markets, has been buoyed by recent shortterm catalysts, including the COVID-19 pandemic which accelerated adoption of online channels, as well as improving sentiment regarding online universities among prospective students. COVID-19 has boosted overall internet penetration to levels significantly exceeding pre-crisis (e-commerce, e-health, e-learning), also including the demand for online education. This has resulted in a pronounced short-term spike in expected growth which, over the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 academic years, is expected to be more than double the annualized growth rate expected from 2022/2023 to 2025/2026 (projected 28% over 2020/2021-2021/2022 academic years as compared to 14% over 2022/2023-2025/2026 academic years, annual growth rates for the Italian online 12 Percentage of population between 25 and 34 with university education in 2018 13 Weighed digitalization score (DESI report) 14 Unioncamere report 2021 “Previsioni dei Fabbisogni Occupazionali e Professionali in Italia a medio termine” 7 ----- undergraduate enrolled base). Students’ improving perception of online universities has been a key factor in recent growth, as illustrated by the 83% of students[15] currently enrolled in online universities who think that the quality of teaching they receive is on par, if not better, than that of traditional universities. This favorable impression is also validated by employability statistics that put online universities slightly above mid-sized physical universities among top employers selecting applicants[16] (over a period of 12 months, 8.6% of students from online universities went to one of the top 50 employers in Italy, vs. 8.5% for mid-sized universities). A rising proportion of Italian high school students is expected to be interested in attending an online university, on the back of increasing perceived strength of their online education offerings. The proportion of first-timers (new university students coming from high school who have never enrolled in university) is expected to increase to 47% of new students in the 2025/2026[17] academic year as compared to 39% today in 2019/2020 and 33% in 2015/2016. Students are attracted to a model that they feel better suits their needs thanks to inherent flexibility, more friendly study experience and better support, alongside lower costs (especially when considering costs ancillary to education such as accommodation and travel). _Structural tailwinds_ The education market has demonstrated steady and resilient growth on the back of various structural tailwinds: - **Historical population growth and economic expansion: increasing population globally and economic growth will naturally expand the addressable market with an increasing number of people willing to get a formal education; - **Emerging middle class willing to supplement formal education: the middle class in particular sees education as an enabler of personal growth and wealth, thus making it likely to supplement formal, basic education with additional courses; - **Rising levels of participation in education: overall participation in education is rising, reflecting a need for skilled workforce globally due to trends in industrialization and modernization that have automated many of the processes that previously employed unskilled workers; - **“Lifelong learning”: even a skilled and educated labor force is likely to require additional skills training due to the speed of digital evolution and the implied new competencies required. Recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these programs have largely been restricted to online channels; - **Government investments to increase levels of education: recognizing higher education as an indicator of citizens’ wealth, governments globally are investing in increased access to education in an effort to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (“SDG”) 2030 Agenda: (i) ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all and (ii) promoting continuous, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Online education also benefits from the specific tailwinds inherent to a delivery model that provides access to people that could not otherwise participate full time or afford to attend a traditional, physical university. Onlinespecific tailwinds in education include: - **Increasing online penetration reaching new potential students: online education unlocks an addressable market by reaching previously underrepresented parts of the population, either due to economic or logistical reasons; - **Government investments in digitalization: focus on digitalization efforts with dedicated funds (i.e. €49.2 billion for Italy alone in the latest European Recovery Fund focused on digitalization of public administration and of the industrial sector[18]); - **Younger generations’ desire for higher education: new generations value both quality education and flexible career paths, which online universities offer, thanks a better-suited consumption model, especially for part-time students; 15 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), source survey @ January 2021, percentage of students enrolled in online universities (n=800) “From a teaching and learning perspective, how do you consider online universities versus the following panel of traditional universities?” 16 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), source Linkedin Recruiter (January 2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis. 17 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis 18 Source Presidency of the Council of Ministers – Italian Government https://www.governo.it/sites/governo.it/files/PNRR_3.pdf] 8 ----- - **Lower overall costs: not requiring costs for attending physical lessons (e.g. housing, transport, cost of living), online education is generally more affordable than traditional one and accordingly appeals to a growing share of the population that desires an education but could not otherwise afford to attend a traditional university; - **Tapping unmet demand: online education offers to people who historically have not been able to obtain a university degree, or are currently working, programs addressing their demand for a more flexible path to a degree; - **Highly Scalable Supply: constrained by the practical limits of in-person education, traditional universities will struggle to meet increasing demand for graduates globally, while online universities’ business model is highly scalable and can increase capacity as needed, leveraging existing platform without additional required large investments in infrastructures. _Current sentiment for online universities_ A market study conducted by a third-party commercial advisor (the “Third Party Commercial Advisor”)[19] highlighted an overall very positive market sentiment towards online universities, which it found were considered highly comparable to traditional ones from a teaching perspective. Of the respondents currently enrolled in online universities, 83% consider teaching from online universities to be on par with, if not better, than traditional universities, and this view is shared by 62% of respondents interested in online universities.[20] A key differentiating point for enrollment in online universities is the perceived increased flexibility and time saving according to 56% of enrolled students, with a faster academic path, higher university support and lower overall cost being other key factors. The study also illustrates how the online education platform offered by online universities is perceived of higher quality due to its “native” nature vs. online/ hybrid education models offered by traditional channels. Employability of online university graduates is on average in line with the levels registered in mid-size or largesize traditional universities: among graduates who switched jobs in the 12 months between January 2020 and January 2021, 8.6% were hired full time by the top 50 Italian employers[21] from online universities, compared to 8.5% for graduates from mid-sized traditional universities and 9.5% for graduates from large-sized traditional universities in the same time frame.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The ELCPs provide information to prospective and current students about the various institutions, and in particular, Pegaso and Mercatorum’s ELCP Points and the Ei-Points, among other things, serve as orientation centers for new students throughout the entire duration of the course they undertake.

Specifically, the percentage of online university graduates that switched jobs over the last 12 months and were hired full-time by one of the top 50 Italian employers was on average 8.6%[87] as of June 2021. This is 0.1% higher than graduates of mid-sized universities and only 0.9% lower than large universities. The comparable employment rate among online university graduates supports the credibility and validity of online education as an alternative higher education offer, which is expected to increase its overall appeal and spur demand across different segments of online universities’ overall addressable market. Compared to other online universities, Pegaso had the largest overall market share among online universities, equal to 33% of graduates hired in the past 12 months by the top 50 employers in Italy.

Superior user experience is also at heart when Multiversity creates its content for these platforms: while professors create the content, they are supported throughout by Multiversity IT staff who ensure that materials produced are optimized to be deployed across all its channels. Multiversity is currently serving one of the largest online student communities in Italy and has a broad social network presence to further engage with its students. The company has developed its platform mostly in-house or by personalizing open-source software, achieving a strong back-end able to deliver seamlessly across all platforms and devices. Multiversity has also fully transitioned its business to cloud-based servers provided by Amazon Web Services’ (“AWS”) cloud datacenters, and currently hosts 150 terabyte/month of data storage and relies on a multi-server system, with a load balancer to manage user traffic overload. This cloud structure adds an additional disaster recovery horizontal layer (through AWS) to the existing redundant copy stored in the company’s Multimedia Centre in Naples.

In the academic years 2018/2019-2019/2020, the number of students grew by 22% for the overall online market. This growth was embedded with a certain amount visibility, as undergraduates (whose courses have a longer duration) and freshmen (the vast majority of which stay with Multiversity up to completion of their degrees) had a significant incidence on overall figures. In particular, undergraduate courses at Multiversity have an average duration of 2.8 years and a strong conversion rate (40% of graduates from 3-year degree programs apply for 1- or 2-year master’s degrees). In addition, with Multiversity Group churn rates below those of the broader online market (approximately 5% vs. 6%[90]), the potential negative impact on the overall student base from early exits is limited, granting additional stability. The average backlog for Pegaso in academic years 2017/2018-2020/2021 was approximately 55%. These dynamics are of particular relevance given that approximately 55% of the Group’s 2020 revenues were generated from undergraduate programs, thus allowing valuable visibility on future top-line evolution. Operating leverage is high, on the back of a significant business model scalability. In particular, the variable component of our cost base is only related to the contributions recognized to the E-learning Centre Points, which grow as the business grows. For instance, during the year ended December 31, 2020, contributions recognized to the E-learning Centre Points accounted for 13% of our total revenues (and 26% of our total cost base), whereas the advertising costs represented 14%, educational and didactic personnel costs were 4%, headquarters and nondidactic personnel costs were 6%, rental costs were 2% and we recorded 9% of our total revenues for other expenses.

While originally Southern Italy has seen the largest number of undergraduate students, strong growth in the online undergraduate market will come from the Italian Northern regions, increasing from circa 27% of the total undergraduate online student base to circa 34% in academic year 2025/2026, adding circa 60,000 new students and doubling the current absolute number. In addition, first-timers—which have been the highest growth category over 2015/2016—2019/2020 academic years, with a 32% CAGR—will continue to increase their relative incidence versus overall undergraduate student base, moving from 33% in academic year 2015/2016 to 47% expected by academic year 2025/2026. Multiversity in-house skills and know-how allow the Group to benefit from several opportunities for additional growth beyond its existing perimeter without the need for significant investments. These opportunities include B2B and continuous learning, becoming a technology provider and international expansion. B2B and continuous learning There are significant opportunities to put the technological platform at the service of a number of prospective clients for a variety of potential needs. In particular, the pandemic forced many companies to implement distance learning initiatives for their employees. Multiversity is already equipped to tap this opportunity through its proprietary technology platform and in-house content. Leveraging our technological capabilities and the know-how and capabilities of our academic staff, Multiversity could offer customized platforms, content and innovative learning programs for companies or specific industries, coupled with our nationwide capillary presence through which we can also offer in-person lessons. Technological platform—“White Label” Multiversity’s proprietary platform and in-house technological capabilities could also be exploited as a product to be sold to third parties. In order to avoid potential conflicts of interests or providing competitors with our technology, this offering could be tailored to K-12 or traditional universities addressing distinct student populations. International expansion Although organic international expansion is rendered difficult by divergent regulatory environments and requirements which reduce our ability to replicate or scale our model, there are potential opportunities in selected international markets where Italian degrees are relevant and attractive. In particular, we are currently developing an offering in Turkey, and will selectively expand to other countries by leveraging the same content and platform to international students seeking an Italian degree recognized across the European Union.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Not only can students follow courses online from anywhere; they can also choose to attend their exams in multiple venues across Italy, in up to 12 different exam sessions per year. Traditional universities, on the other hand, only offer exams in one primary location, in up to 4 exam sessions per year. Online universities also offer a more student-friendly study experience. Lessons can be followed from anywhere via the online platform, with video-recorded classes lasting c. 25-30 minutes each, available 24/7 to students. Study packs are provided for each lesson, as well as numerous online mock exams. The offering is complemented by flexible additional services, such as dedicated tutors, online chat client and specific forums for both students and professors. Traditional universities, by contrast, generally only offer lessons on campus, with fixed schedules lasting 1-2 hours, and classes are usually not recorded. Specific textbooks are required, while the supporting materials and mock exams are often limited. Office hours are fixed and must be booked in advance, making communication between students and professors more difficult. Beyond encompassing all of the key advantages common to online universities, Multiversity’s offering in particular overperforms competitors thanks to its unique physical presence across Italy, including approximately 100 iconic exam locations, and a superior proprietary technological platform and contents. More convenient alternative Online education platforms offer students significantly decreased all-in costs of education versus traditional universities. Tuition fees are aligned to those of competing public traditional universities, however since courses can be attended remotely there is no need for students to acquire or rent accommodation to be close to the university (that is often one of the most sizeable and prohibitive implicit costs of university attendance) or pay for transit. Moreover, students can realize significant savings on course materials, given that all study materials are made available online and are included in the tuition fee. In traditional universities, by contrast, the primary source of information used in courses is physical textbooks, which students often need to purchase at significant cost. Multiversity’s pricing is highly competitive, both among other online universities and, to an even higher extent, when compared to traditional universities. Pegaso, for example, offers an average undergraduate preferential tuition fee per year of circa €1,800, compared to circa €3,000 per year for Cusano and e-Campus. Officially recognized degree and equivalent legal value university degree The degrees are accredited, have the same legal value and are verified in the same way as public and private universities degrees in Italy by the MIUR. The Italian national agency for the evaluation of university and research systems (Agenzia Nazionale di _Valutazione del Sistema Universitario e della Ricerca or “ANVUR”) periodically inspects online and traditional_ universities to evaluate their services and provide them with an official accreditation.

Multiversity’s reputation and brand awareness has benefited from the experience and breadth of its academic staff, which includes 76 full and associate professors (university professor holding a chair hired indefinitely), 155 extraordinary professors (experts on the specific research development sector), 479 contract professors (discipline expert with renewable annual assignment), 16 researchers (scholar of specific research fields) and 88 tutors developing cutting-edge proprietary content. Among its speakers and guests, Multiversity has hosted a breadth of personalities including former ministers, general secretary of the largest Italian labor union and award-winning film directors and screenwriters. Capillary Physical Network and Iconic Venues Proximity and ease of access to local infrastructure are key determinants for students when choosing between traditional forms of higher education and online and, within the latter, selecting one university over another. Multiversity enjoys a unique presence in Italy thanks to Pegaso’s approximately 100 iconic exam locations in the most important Italian cities and a difficult to replicate network of approximately 820 Pegaso and 800 Mercatorum ELCPs located throughout the country. The numerous locations across Italy allow students to sit for exams close to their home cities. The use of iconic buildings as exam centers is also a contributor to establishing strong brand recognition with a unique positioning and brand awareness, not only among the students’ population, but also among all the members of academic staff. The large E-learning Center network of affiliates guarantees Multiversity a capillary presence across the country, offering orientation services and information to new potential students with a variety of different academic profiles, interests and backgrounds. This local presence throughout Italy allows flexibility of strategy to adapt to future market changes and proximity to students. Effective commercial approach across traditional and online channels Unlike their traditional counterparts, online universities generally display a more committed approach towards marketing and advertising, engaging with potential and existing students both online and via traditional channels such as billboards, television and radio. Multiversity has developed a particularly strong position across the spectrum, thanks to a well-developed multi-channel marketing strategy coupled with its capillary nationwide network. Pegaso shows a higher social media following than most of online and traditional competitors, on the back of strong student engagement. This level of interaction was aided in part by targeted advertising with exclusive partners, such as a co-branding campaign with the movie Spider-man: Homecoming in 2017, and by airing TV spots during peak times, for example during widely-followed shows in Italy. The effectiveness of Multiversity online marketing strategy is particularly relevant when considering the increasing penetration of first time students in the Italian online higher education channel, with such category— by nature, given the younger age - being more receptive and used to online forms of advertising vs. traditional ones. Additionally, Pegaso and Mercatorum have established and consistently grown their unique network via framework agreements with more than 1,500 associations including public bodies, trade unions, the Chamber of Commerce, municipalities, cultural associations, private companies and sports associations. This network is over six times larger than any of the key competitors’ and continues to grow, with approximately 350 new agreements concluded by Pegaso in the last year alone, 1.6 times the number of total agreements that the second player in the market had in 2020. These framework agreements are fundamental to Multiversity’s business model, as they increase the possibility to secure a captive customer base. Credible and Valid Access to Top Quality Employers Multiversity’s strong link with the Italian Chamber of Commerce (through its stake in Mercatorum) allow Multiversity’s students to be best positioned to meet Italy’s future employment needs. Multiversity’s offering is tailored to respond to the future demands of the Italian job market. The latest estimates by Unioncamere relating to employment needs between 2020 and 2024 predict that almost 900,000 graduates will find a job between 2020 and 2024. Specifically, in the fields in which Multiversity offers degree and other programs, the expected need will be circa 120,000 graduates in Economics & Business Administration, circa 120,000 in Engineering, circa 105,000 in Teaching and Training and circa 90,000 in Law, collectively accounting for approximately 50% of the total projected demand. 119 ----- _Demand for graduates in the Italian job market and Multiversity offer[85]_ Multiversity single courses, including FIT (courses related to anthropo-phsycho-pedagological disciplines for students striving to become 2nd grade teachers), FORM, and Single Courses, are aligned with Public Administration hiring trends through “Concorso Pubblico” (i.e. public hiring tenders that require a specific exam). These hiring trends were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing public tenders by 60-70%[86] compared to previous years, but a rebound is expected as these tend to be recurring hiring tenders over the years. Through 2025, Unioncamere expects the need to hire 740,000 new employees into public administration, either to replace workers who are retiring (93%) or for new positions (7%).",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

It is the largest single contributor to Multiversity’s results and accounted for 89% (€167 million) of Multiversity’s revenues and 86% (€88 million) of Multiversity’s Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 81% (€108 million) of Multiversity’s revenues and 76% (€64 million) of Multiversity’s Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Pegaso is physically present throughout Italy through its 96 exam centers located in city centers and a network of approximately 820[94] ELCPs. Pegaso does not require students to pass any admission tests in order to be admitted to its courses, and does not have any restrictions in terms of the number of students it can accommodate given its online nature (without the logistical constraints of classrooms and campus facilities) and scalable model. Pegaso uses IT and online technologies and maintains a proprietary platform capable of managing and making high quality online university courses accessible to its students. The teaching support specialists who work alongside teaching staff (tutors, mentors and coaches) assist the student throughout their course of study. Advanced technological and interactive tools, TV learning and an inclusive online student community are all tools employed by Pegaso to offer students a distinctive educational experience, bridging the gap between distance learning and a traditional university experience. Academic qualifications awarded at the end of study courses have the same legal value as qualifications issued by traditional universities. Pegaso’s online undergraduate courses, postgraduate master’s courses and training courses represent a one of a kind educational offer in Italy. Pegaso allows students to study anywhere with a high degree of flexibility (lessons are recorded and accessible 24/7) and to take exams in one of its 96 examination centers throughout Italy or, recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, online. It is not yet determined whether online examinations will be a permanent offering or whether this option will be made available to students only during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the legislation governing the current state of emergency, academic institutions in Italy have the option to carry out online examinations until December 31, 2021. Pegaso intends to appeal to the Council of State within the required timeframe against a decision of the Administrative Court (TAR) of the Lazio region which upheld the MIUR’s rejection of Pegaso’s proposed amendment to its internal procedures in order to permanently offer online examinations to its students. See “—Litigation and legal, tax and administrative proceedings” below. Pegaso has strengthened its international presence through a network of partners worldwide (“POU centers”), in order to foster the development of its courses and study areas. The POU centers are responsible for conducting student orientation activities and assistance, as well as providing support to meet local education needs and facilitate contact with local academic institutions. Approximately six POUs are currently active. The POU based in Turkey is the most active to date. _Universitas Mercatorum_ Mercatorum accounted for 9% (€17 million) of Multiversity’s revenues and 6% (€6 million) of its Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 17% (€23 million) of revenues and 16.5% (€14 million) of Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021. It had approximately 23,000 students enrolled for the 2020/2021 academic year. Mercatorum is a non-commercial entity and the first public-private jointly owned university institution in Italy Unioncamere indirectly owns 33.33%. Mercatorum was established with the objective of becoming a market leader in business training, with a direct linkage to the job market and Italian corporations. As with Pegaso, Mercatorum does not require students to pass any admission tests in order to be admitted to its courses. Similarly to Pegaso, Mercatorum also has a strong physical presence throughout Italy, with approximately 800[95] ELCPs and 56 exam centers (through the Italian chambers of commerce network).",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

It offers a bachelor’s degree, EQF/MQF Level 7, delivered in English, in Informatics, with a duration of one year. It also offers a newly accredited, English-language PhD, EQF/MQF Level 8, in Sustainable Development, for which course content is in development. In addition to the accredited courses, Pegaso International offers some courses held accredited by Pegaso such as a three-year bachelor’s degree in Tourism Sciences, a master’s degree in Economics and a five-year single-cycle degree (laurea magistrale) in Law, and a PhD in Law, Education and Development. Pegaso International’s annual tuition fee for the degree courses is €3,000 euros. Some agreements with certain commercial partners have been entered into providing for the application of preferential rates equal to €2,000 per academic year. 107 In partnership with Pegaso. 108 No fee is payable by successful Ph.D. candidates, who receive a grant from the university to conduct research for the duration of the Ph.D. 109 Total number of enrolled students includes an additional 224 students enrolled in the undergraduate degree course Tourism Sciences, which has been discontinued as of the 21/22 academic year 134 ----- The cost of the PhD is €7,500 for the terms of the three year course (if paid as one lump sum, upon enrollment, the student will be entitled to a preferential rate totalling €6,000). For the 2020/2021 academic year, 715 students were enrolled in Pegaso International (90 undergraduate courses and 625 in postgraduate and language courses). _Ancillary Fees and Services_ Various other services are offered to the students Pegaso and, where indicated, Mercatorum for additional fees, representing additional revenue streams, such as: Undergraduate ancillary fees and services: - Alternative exam location fee (equal to €150): this service, applicable to students of Pegaso and Mercatorum and payable on an annual basis, enables the student to attend the exam sessions in alternative examination centers outside of the default location in Naples (as regards Pegaso) or Rome (as regards Mercatorum). Paying such fee allows the student to attend examinations at any of the other exam centers amongst Pegaso’s 96 or Mercatorum’s 56 locations across Italy; - Supplemental tuition fee (equal to €282[110]): payable by default by each student of Pegaso in the first year of undergraduate enrollment; - Certificate fee (€50 per certificate): payable in order to obtain official transcripts or other official university documents from either of Pegaso or Mercatorum; and - Supplemental diploma fee (equal to €70): payable by students in order to obtain an additional copy supplementing the official qualification obtained at the end of a course of study. The supplemental diploma provides a description of the nature, level, context, content and status of the studies carried out and completed by the student according to a standard eight point model, developed at the initiative of the European Commission, the Council of Europe and UNESCO, and is in Italian and English. Postgraduate ancillary fees and services: - Supplemental tuition fee (equal to €116[111]): payable by default by each student of Pegaso upon postgraduate enrollment; - Certificate fee (equal to €50 per certificate): payable in order to obtain official transcripts or other official university certifications from either Pegaso or Mercatorum. _Learning Method_ Multiversity’s e-learning institutions’ educational methods involve setting learning objectives (units of learning content) that are to be achieved through a multitude of tools, materials and services. For each video class, these are: - the written core text of the lecture, with bibliographical references and notes; - slides (supplemented with text, tables, images, graphs) with audio commentary by the lecturer; - video recordings of the lessons, available to view in either real-time or subsequently at any other time on the online platform; and - self-assessment exercises to evaluate the student’s progress. Final examinations take place at Multiversity’s examination centers throughout Italy (or, in the case of Pegaso International, Malta) and are overseen by a commission appointed by the rector and chaired by a university professor. During the COVID-19 pandemic, due to emergency measures adopted by the government, exams have been taking place online through the platform. In order to complete a specific course, students are required to: - carry out a number of interim assessments (on-line tests to verify learning stages, development of papers, any laboratory activities, etc.); - view at least 80% of the online lessons available on the platform; and - pass the final examination, to be taken in person at the university facilities (or, for so long as emergency measures are in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, online). 110 Previously €172 until February 2020 111 Previously €50 until February 2020 135 ----- Within each course, students are subject, for each discipline, to interim assessments which are compulsory but not a prerequisite to qualify for the final examination, in order to constantly monitor learning levels. The assessments may consist of tests (closed-answer, open-answer, multiple-choice, etc.), exercises, simulations or group projects. _Credit and qualification frameworks_ Pegaso and Mercatorum’s undergraduate courses confer the qualifications provided for under the Italian Qualifications Framework, as established by the Italian Ministry of Education in accordance with the Qualifications Framework for the European Higher Education Area. The European Credit Transfer System (“ECTS”), an EU-wide education metric aimed at making studies and courses more transparent, applies to the courses offered at Multiversity’s core institutions. This allows students to move between countries to obtain their academic qualifications and study periods abroad which are recognized by allowing credits taken at one higher educational institution to be counted towards a qualification acquired at another educational institution. One CFU is equivalent to one ECTS credit and students must cover approximately one third of studies online in order to meet the requirements to pass the examinations Pegaso International’s courses provide qualifications recognised under the ECTS system, applied within the European Qualification Framework (“EQF”). The EQF is an eight-level learning outcomes-based framework for all types of qualifications that serves as a harmonisation tool between different national qualifications frameworks. This framework helps improve transparency, comparability and portability of qualifications and makes it possible to compare qualifications from different countries and institutions. The EQF covers all types and all levels of qualifications and the use of learning outcomes to acknowledge the actual skills and qualifications of individuals. The level increases according to the level of proficiency, level 1 being the lowest and level 8 the highest. Courses offered by Pegaso International are EQF level 6 or level 7. The EQF is closely linked to national qualifications frameworks, thereby providing a comprehensive map of all types and levels of qualifications in Europe, which are increasingly accessible through qualification databases. _Amount of content available and frequency of refresh_ The course content is typically refreshed every three years. However, some courses that by their very nature are subject to more frequent updates, such as law or legal studies, are updated as required on a rolling basis (usually every six months) by academic staff. Each professor is required to confirm on an annual basis that the teaching materials relating to their courses are up-to-date. _Quality assurance_ In order to ensure the professionalism and quality of degree courses, the MIUR conducts quality assessments through the Agenzia Nazionale di Valutazione Del Sistema Universitario e della Ricerca (the Agency for the Evaluation of the University and Research System or “ANVUR”), which is vested with the authority to, among other things, evaluate procedures, results and outputs of institutions’ management, teaching, research and technological transfer activities, and conduct the rankings of merit and prestige of both traditional and online universities. The assignment of such rankings is a legal requirement for the operation of (i) universities offering at least 30% of courses as distance learning courses or (ii) online universities, which are both scored on a scale from A-tel (very positive) to E-tel (unsatisfactory), with the consequential closure of the online delivery platform in the event of a negative outcome. In its most recent research quality evaluation, the commission of experts appointed by ANVUR assigned a Level C-tel score to both Pegaso and Mercatorum (respectively the second and third highest scores with respect to the other Italian online universities in 2017),[112] corresponding to a satisfactory grade in accordance with applicable Italian regulations. The periodic accreditation assessments are processed following on-site visits to the universities by the commission appointed by ANVUR. The periodic accreditation visits are carried out in three phases: (i) a remote examination of the documentation made available by the university to the commission, (ii) the actual on-site visit in order to examine the degree programs and the departments selected by ANVUR for each university and (iii) the drafting of a report by the commission. See “Regulation” below. Pegaso International, as a provider authorized to deliver courses of study with MFHEA (formerly NCFHE) License n.2006-001, is required to ensure compliance with the ten standards of quality assurance established by the MFHEA in the performance of its internal administrative and teaching procedures. The MFHEA conducts periodic audits of providers to determine compliance with QA requirements and the subsequent renewal of the license. 112 https://www.anvur.it/attivita/ava/accreditamento-periodico/rapporti-anvur-di-accreditamento-periodico/ 136 ----- Pegaso International is periodically evaluated by an external commission appointed by the MFHEA in order to obtain the renewal of its license as a Higher Education Institution, which is due to be evaluated in February 2022. In view of the audit, all operational procedures have been drawn up in an internal quality assurance manual and evaluated through a self-assessment process whose results, reported in a self-assessment report, have been presented to the panel of Auditors. The assessment of the submitted documentation will be followed by an on-location visit and interviews with faculty, students, staff and management, and will be completed in early 2022. For further information on the quality assurance framework to which the universities of Multiversity are subject. See “Regulation” below. _Performance monitoring systems for academic staff_ Although there is no requirement under the applicable Italian legislative framework to monitor the performance of academic staff in private universities, Pegaso and Mercatorum have both established the respective procedures, as indicated in the “Quality Assurance” section of their respective websites. There are also models for evaluation of professors by students (required by ANVUR) which are carried out periodically. The performance of university professors is also evaluated on the number of academic papers published by them (i.e. on the basis of their personal research track record). Professors are contractually required to ensure their course materials remain up to date and the majority of the materials are updated on a rolling basis, while a full content update is required every three years.

With regard to Mercatorum, its core mission focuses on recognizing equal dignity and importance of all cultures, and the opportunity to evolve through research and teaching. This mission is pursued through development of professional competence in the educational process, fostering conditions favourable to raising the moral and civil awareness of students, setting up academic activities on the basis of meritocratic and transparent criteria, protection of integrity and individuality of each student and promotion of the values of equality and social responsibility. For further information about each university’s rankings, see “Regulation” below. Multiversity’s institutions are very active in funding campaigns focusing on training and research. In respect of Mercatorum, since 2020 grants related to 45 projects have been awarded for a total amount of approximately €1.7 million (of which approximately €1,1 million was awarded in 2021). In respect of Pegaso, since 2019, grants related to 21 research projects have been awarded for a total amount of €4.1 million. In 2020, numerous three-year research projects were launched totalling approximately €916 thousand, financed in part (€260 thousand) with funds from the ‘5 per mille’ (0.05% accrual collected from Italian taxpayers, a portion of which is distributed to research and education institutions) allocated to universities by the MIUR. Grants and research projects contributed to approximately 1% of Pegaso’s revenues and 8% of Mercatorum’s revenues in each case for the year ended December 31, 2020. Over the past three years, Multiversity’s institutions have been involved in the publication of more than 30 research volumes in various subjects, including psychology, philosophy, law and economics. 137 -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

In particular, there is a high incidence of younger generations and first-timers and students from southern Italy, the latter being reflective of Pegaso and Mercatorum’s origins as universities based in the southern and central regions of Italy. However, the volume of students from northern Italy has steadily increased in recent years. The demographic profile of Multiversity’s student population plays a critical role for its operations, with undergraduate students building the majority of Multiversity’s institutions’ student base. For the academic year 2020/2021, 65% of the total number of Multiversity’s institutions’ students were enrolled in undergraduate courses whereas 35% of its students were enrolled in graduate courses. In addition, students aged 18-34 represented approximately 70% of the total number of enrolled undergraduate students in 2020/2021 academic year, compared with approximately 60% for the 113 Includes undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, specialist master’s degrees and five-year single cycle degrees (laurea magistrale) 114 Includes postgraduate master’s courses, higher education courses, specialization courses and (in respect of Pegaso) certifications 115 Includes single exams 138 ----- 2019/2020 academic year. First-timers (i.e. students accessing higher education for the first time) accounted for 47% of the total number of enrolled undergraduate students in 2020/2021 academic year, compared with 44% in the previous academic year, and are expected to grow further in the near future. The student base is mainly composed of students coming from Southern Italy, both in the undergraduate courses (61% for the 2020/2021 academic year) and the postgraduate courses (52% for the 2020/2021 academic year). A strong expansion of Multiversity’s student base into Northern Italy can be observed for enrollments in both undergraduate courses (23% in the academic year 2020/2021 as compared to 15% in the academic year 2018/2019) and postgraduate courses (25% in the academic year 2020/2021). For further details on the breakdown of Pegaso and Mercatorum’s undergraduate and postgraduate student population for the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 academic years by age, geographical provenance and the incidence of first timers, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— _Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Key Performance Indicators.”_ The overall churn rate across Pegaso and Mercatorum for the 2020/2021 academic year was equal to approximately 5%.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The evolution of the student base demonstrates a fast-growing trend in the undergraduate degree offering, which represents the largest contribution to revenue given the higher tuition fee, ancillary services revenue on top of the tuition fee and duration of the students’ academic career (undergraduate degrees have a duration spanning from three to five years, whilst postgraduate courses), whilst showing a decline in enrollments in postgraduate and individual courses. The latter is due to the seasonality effect linked to public tenders (concorsi pubblici) for specific professions such as teachers. Such public tenders are usually carried out every two years by the public administration and therefore the decrease in enrollments for the 2020/2021 academic year is expected to be recovered once the tenders are launched once again by the public administration in the coming year.

(the “Plan”) for the benefit of directors, employees and/or collaborators of the Group and its subsidiaries to be identified by the Board of Directors from time to time. The Multiversity shareholders’ meeting of June 25, 2021 approved a non-proportional share capital increase by a nominal amount equal to €1,000 in favour of some key managers of the Group, who have been assigned the option rights to subscribe the capital increase once some relevant conditions are met. The stock options conferred pursuant to the Plan can be exercised upon the occurrence of certain events and subject to certain conditions. Since the key conditions are not met at the time of preparation of the Multiversity Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the share capital was not subscribed. Such new shares are reserved for subscription within the final deadline of December 31, 2035. The key managers of the Group, as approved by the Board of Directors meeting held in February 2021, are attributed a bonus if some key parameters, in terms of Group and individual economic performance are met, based on the year end results. An estimate of year-end bonuses is accrued in the Group financial statements. _Faculty retention and churn rates_ The associate or tenured professors of Pegaso or Mercatorum that were originally in the organization have rarely left the Multiversity educational institutions voluntarily. In certain instances, faculty staff employed on temporary contracts have been offered positions elsewhere. Professors that are not tenured are engaged through fixed term contracts, which are renewed on an annual basis. Many junior professors are employed as researchers on fixed term contracts and are subsequently employed indefinitely after winning tenure as associates. Researchers are offered a three-year contract that may be extended by the institution for a further two years if their research meets certain criteria. As part of Multiversity’s talent retention strategy, temporary personnel that qualify for associate professorship typically commence the process of becoming tenured professors within approximately four months. _Faculty training and development_ Pegaso has opened a Teaching and Learning Center dedicated to the training of faculty members with a particular focus on remote learning techniques. Mandatory training courses are also made available to professors on the elearning platform (e.g. techniques/guides for organizing materials, courses on interactive teaching) and training for tutors (led by more experienced tutors and professors). The same applies to Mercatorum where, in addition, given the university’s assistance to the Italian chambers of commerce, focus groups are established to monitor and study legislative developments that are relevant to the chambers of commerce.

The platform does not run on external software and is entirely owned by Multiversity. The e-learning platforms and core systems are developed fully in-house, originally leveraging an open-source software that was customized to develop a unique proprietary platform. Since 2017, the platform has been run and stored on servers hosted by AWS cloud data centers to maximize efficiency, with horizontal and physical back-up for disaster recovery. A backup copy of the stored data is kept at the data center at Pegaso’s headquarters in Naples, which is activated in the event of disaster recovery to ensure zero time loss of service. The current package contracted with AWS is for 150 terabyte/month of data storage and relies on a multi-server system, with a load balancer to manage user traffic overload. In the period from 2018 to 2020, Multiversity launched: (i) a mobile app; (ii) a platform for online exams, due to the impossibility of taking exams in person given COVID restrictions; and (iii) machine learning algorithms that guide the user in the learning experience and increase their qualifications and skills. Through the use of cookies and app tracking, personalized content is provided to users with respect to their university career, including suggestions for postgraduate pathways and invitations to continue studying if certain academic targets are reached. 117 Net of depreciation and devaluation 118 By means of a deed dated October 25, 2019, Multiversity S.p.A. transferred the business unit that carries out university training support services, including proprietary rights in the IT platform to Multiversity S.r.l. As a result of the aforementioned contribution, all existing relationships and all new activities relating to the aforementioned business unit are managed by Multiversity S.r.l. 143 ----- Multiversity has registered the IT platform’s trademark, “Iuniversity” with the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers (“SIAE”), the algorithm underlying the platform’s flowchart having also been registered in the public register of software held by SIAE. Pegaso, Mercatorum and Pegaso International use Multiversity’s proprietary IT platform in order to deliver their courses. Multiversity’s IT team is currently composed of 25 employees. A new web version of the platform was launched over the summer of 2021, incorporating several updates including a new design, more interactive interface and other user experience improvements. While delayed by the COVID pandemic, Multiversity is in the process of obtaining the following ISO certifications: - UNI EN ISO 9001:2015; - UNI EN ISO 14001:2015; - UNI EN ISO 45001:2018; - UNI EN ISO 20000:2018; - UNI EN ISO 22301:2012; and - UNI EN ISO 27001:2013. _Evaluation and compliance of IT platform_ Pegaso and Mercatorum must meet legal requirements, which are reviewed by the ANVUR Evaluation Committee every five years. Pegaso and Mercatorum scored high rankings/ratings with respect to the technology used during the last evaluation in October 2017. Under the previous legislative framework, periodic evaluations needed to be carried out every five years through a five-day site visit by the ANVUR Evaluation Committee. Pegaso obtained the highest rating among online universities during the last periodic evaluation and on that basis the site visit (which would be necessary in case of an insufficient rating) is no longer required. As a result, it is sufficient to provide a report to the ANVUR Evaluation Committee. The most recent report was provided to the ANVUR Evaluation Committee on June 30, 2021. _Cybersecurity_ Multiversity has established and maintains cybersecurity systems that are developed and updated internally, including a monitoring system that monitors the platform and code transactions on it. The cloud data centers are only accessible through Pegaso’s headquarters in Naples, by authorized members of the IT team through a two-tier security system. In particular, Multiversity employs a cybersecurity program leased from Amazon in order to protect against the risk of DDoS[119] cyber-attacks. Users’ passwords are tokenized; access to servers is allowed only through the network and firewalls present at the business center at headquarters. Access to all externally-facing applications is protected by a web application firewall and users are required to register and create a personal profile accessible through a username and password, which is encrypted and tokenized, ensuring that the specific user may only view areas within the application to which it has been granted access. In addition, a secure hash algorithm protects users’ stored credentials on the server side. The security measures adopted under the platform ensure protection of user’s personal data in compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”) and Multiversity provides information to its employees on an annual basis as to the data protection measures that need to be put in place. Multiversity has procedures in place for data collection and processing in accordance with the GDPR and Italian applicable law (including in order to ensure that any revocation of permission by users to process their personal data is actioned within 24 hours). In terms of client/server side security, the devices used by the students and academic staff are separate and there is no direct client-side access to the servers. In terms of protection against data loss, a back-up copy of stored data is accessible from the data center at Pegaso’s headquarters in Naples and is activated in the event of disaster recovery to ensure zero time loss of 119 ‘Denial of Service’ cyber attacks in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. 144 ----- service. In the event of a system memory overload, temporary servers are created ensuring sufficient system memory/CPU to run the platform. Through the use of this system, the platform does not have a limit to the maximum number of users that may access it simultaneously. Multiversity carries out penetration tests internally every time a new IT procedure is created, and risk assessments are also carried out on an annual basis and in conjunction with any penetration test). _Future developments_ Multiversity’s focus is to invest further in cybersecurity to continue to strengthen its (already advanced) IT platforms. There may also be opportunities for expansion to provide IT services to third parties or, in the case of the purchase or establishment of additional online institutions, to migrate them to Multiversity’s systems. However, this may involve substantial investment. _Key differentiating platform features_ The following characteristics are the key differentiating features of Multiversity’s IT platform: - the platform is entirely responsive; - all the functions that are accessible through the web browser are also available on the application for mobile devices; - it uses a social learning system to assist users in the study process by enabling the formation of an online student community. In addition, the platform employs machine learning algorithms that propose the best paths for the training of specific users. The study process “adapts” to the user performance, raising or lowering the difficulty of the learning model according to the user’s intermediate results. For example, the algorithm may suggest additional exercises on subject where students underperformed, or, alternatively, more advanced studies to highly performing students. Such algorithm is used to market additional learning pathways to individual users, through the use of cookies, tracking apps, questionnaires, grades, the number of times that an exam is repeated and other tools.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Such ELCPs also provide technical assistance such as recovery of access credentials to the platform. 120 Pegaso, Mercatorum and Certipass in some cases each have accreditation agreements with the same ELCP, which therefor performs services for more than one such institution 145 ----- _EIPASS Points_ In respect of Certipass, of the approximately 1,300 EIPASS Points, indicatively: - 510 are “Business Centers” such as training centers; - 350 are “Academies” based in state educational institutions; - 33 are “Master Centers” such as second-level centers that can affiliate with other Business Centers; and - 15 are “Partner Centers” such as third-level centers that can affiliate with both Business Centers and Master Centers. The centers directly affiliated with Academies, Master Centers and Partner Centers, and which therefore have an indirect relationship with Certipass, total about 360. Multiversity’s objective is to enlarge the network with new types of centers including, for example, universities. The ELCPs are located on the premises owned and controlled by third-party service providers that have entered into accreditation agreements with the relevant institution. See “Material Contracts—Accreditation agreements _for ELCPs.” Such third parties include language centers, basic IT course providers, education facilities,_ municipalities and centers to help prepare for traditional university admission tests. Prior to the execution of each accreditation agreement, each center is assessed by the relevant institution as being a qualified center for carrying out teaching, education and training projects, in line with that institution’s objectives. _Examination Centers_ Exams usually take place at the central examination headquarters of Pegaso in San Giorgio a Cremano, however, upon payment of the alternative exam location fee (detailed above under “Offering—Ancillary Fees and _Services”), students may choose to take their exams at one of Pegaso’s other examination centers._ As regards Mercatorum, oral examinations are held in Rome at the headquarters of Unioncamere, whereas written examinations are held across several large Italian cities at the headquarters of the local Chambers of Commerce. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and a state of emergency being declared across the country, exams are being taken exclusively online. However, unless the state of emergency is extended and national regulations are not amended in order to permit online examinations on a regular basis, on premise examinations are currently expected to resume after December 31, 2021. _Center location mapping_ The below graph illustrates the geographic distribution of the various learning and examination centers across the Italian territory. As is shown, these are more highly concentrated in the southern part of the country. 146 ----- Pegaso has approximately 103 premises, composed of examination venues, its headquarters and administrative offices across Italy. Mercatorum makes use of the network of the Italian Chambers of Commerce system, thereby giving it access to approximately 56 locations.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Each entity accredited as an ELCP Point or EI-Point is required to meet and maintain certain standards including in relation to physical storage, technological equipment, minimum number of employees, etc. Each ELCP Point and EI-Point is remunerated by way of a contribution of up to (i) 20% of the tuition fees paid by each student enrolled in undergraduate degree courses, excluding any ancillary fees, and which benefits from the orientation services provided by the relevant ELCP Point and EI-Point, and (ii) 25% of the tuition fees paid by each student enrolled in postgraduate or post-diploma master’s or training courses and which benefits from the orientation services provided by the relevant ELCP Point or EI-Point. There is no obligation for ELCP Points or EI-Points to enroll or to recruit students. _EIPASS Points_ With regard to Certipass’ EIPASS Points, the terms of the relevant accreditation agreement have an initial duration of two years. Pursuant to the relevant agreement, the EIPASS Point acquires a package of EI cards at wholesale price and agrees to resell them to customers at the retail price detailed in the contract All agreements confer the right on the relevant center to promote and disseminate the programs, EIPASS certifications and services provided by Certipass itself, and the authorization to represent a Certipass exam physical venue. Certipass agrees to provide to each EIPASS Point the necessary know-how and technical resources in order for it to offer Certipass services, and also provides it with technical support and assistance as well as access to its platform. The relevant EIPASS Center can apply for Ei cards, online courses, credits, and/or the qualification of a 147 ----- new supervisor and/or trainer through the DIDASKO platform and undertakes to resell them at the minimum prices indicated in the reference price list attached to the agreement. The commercial terms of each type of contract are summarised below: - Business contract: provides the center with an activation kit composed of 30 “pocket skills” courses, for an activation price of € 1,727; - Master contract: provides the center with an activation kit composed of 300 Ei cards, for an activation price of €16,770. The EIPASS Point undertakes to activate a minimum of five EIPASS Point affiliates within the first year of the agreement and at all times to maintain such number of affiliates for the duration of agreement (alternatively the center will become a Business EIPASS Center); - Partner contract: provides the center with an activation kit composed of 300 Ei cards, 200 online course and 60 loyalty promotional credits, for an activation price of €24,400. The EIPASS Point undertakes to activate a minimum of 20 affiliated EIPASS Point within the first year of the agreement and at all times to maintain such number of affiliates for the duration of agreement. Should it fail to activate the 20 affiliated EIPASS Points indicated above, the EIPASS Point undertakes to purchase 2,500 Ei cards for the second year of activity (alternatively the center will become a Master EIPASS Center). _Commercial agreements securing captive customers_ Pegaso and Mercatorum together have over 1,500 agreements in place with associations of public bodies, trade unions, municipalities, cultural associations, private companies and sports associations for, inter alia, employee training and which provide for the application of preferential rates for their employees. Partners’ employees are incentivized to attend these courses in order to accelerate their career paths or to comply with requirements of regulators or employers. As such, this market is captive in nature and exposes Pegaso and Mercatorum to a large potential customer base for its entire service offering. The vast majority of such agreements are Business-to-Customer and apply directly to students. Preferential rates are applicable upon verification at the time of enrollment that the student is entitled to benefit from the preferential rates pursuant to the relevant agreement. The terms of such agreements are negotiated on a case by case basis with each partner and therefore vary (see “—Preferential and corporate rates” above), however most provide for a reduction of the full annual degree course tuition fee of €3,000 to €2,000. These rates may apply to specific degree, master’s or higher education courses, and in some cases may also apply to certain categories of students—for example, new graduates or pregnant women, in order to render the course offering more attractive to such groups. For courses that last more than one year, the preferential tuition fee will apply for each year of the course. _Partnerships_ Multiversity has entered into collaboration agreements with approximately 19 partners for the purposes of creating and offering highly specialized courses for professionals in areas such as sustainability and the environment, media and communications, corporate social responsibility and smart mobility. Examples of such collaborations are: - Master’s course in Energy and the Environment offered by Pegaso in collaboration with ANBEA, the National Register of Energy and Environment Bioneers.

(“RCS”) and Pegaso in relation to the establishment of RCS Academy; - Framework Agreement “Teamsystem & Pegaso Academy” dated July 29, 2021 between TeamSystem S.p.A. (“TeamSystem”) and Pegaso. Pursuant to the agreement, the parties agree to cooperate in the creation of educational content and the delivery of postgraduate programs (targeting postgraduate students, post-diploma students or students already having professional experience) as well as professional updates for managers and professionals. Furthermore, the agreement is intended to regulate potential tailor-made projects for companies in the context of professional training programs. The framework agreement further provides for (i) the provision of interactive educational workshops with university professors and professionals; (ii) giving students access to online presentations of the accounting software developed and 148 ----- owned by TeamSystem for the duration of the course; (iii) supplying students with a certificate of the “Teamsystem & Pegaso Academy”; and (iv) granting students a coupon that allows them to purchase TeamSystem’s licenses for accessing the above-mentioned accounting software at a discounted rate. The rights to the course materials remain exclusively with Pegaso; - Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding (protocollo d’intesa) (“MoU”) between I-Talent Factory S.r.l. and Pegaso, the parties have agreed to create a training and information web portal called “IF Academy”, targeting primarily operators in the field of entertainment, cinema, theatre and TV. The IF Academy shall realize, through a team of experts, courses in directing, screenwriting, production, acting and master classes in various subjects to be held through the web and the Pegaso’s e-learning platform; - Framework agreement dated October 17, 2019 between Gambero Rosso Academy S.r.l. and Mercatorum.

Such initiatives include: (i) the establishment of courses and joint activities for higher education, (ii) the creation of joint placement projects, (iii) the facilitation of internships and (iv) the recognition of economic benefits for the enrolment in courses held by Mercatorum; - Agreement dated September 1, 2021 between Gambero Rosso S.p.A. and Mercatorum. Pursuant to the agreement, the parties agreed to establish “Gambero Rosso University”, an academy offering six bachelor’s degree courses, two master’s degree courses and four higher education courses in management, tourism and the food and beverage sectors, to be held by through e-learning means. Mercatorum has exclusive ownership rights over the video and video-lectures content used at the Gambero Rosso University. Proprietary title of the course materials used for the specialized courses developed as a result of the collaboration, as well the remuneration, if any, offered to the relevant partner for their collaboration on the relevant project, is agreed with the relevant partner on a case by case basis. _Cooperation agreements with international institutions_ In order to promote internationalization in the fields of research, teaching and learning, every year Pegaso enters into cooperation agreements with universities, including in connection with the Erasmus + Program, from all over the world and actively participates in prestigious international networks. Such agreements with international universities are made for a variety of purposes, including joint scientific projects, exchange of materials and publications, creation of new courses of study, organization of conferences, seminars and cultural initiatives. Pegaso currently has 84 such agreements in place with higher education institutions in 32 countries (excluding Italy). _Material investments and financing arrangements_ On July 12, 2021, Pegaso invested €20 million in a medium/high risk investment portfolio managed by Banca Generali S.p.A.

Such amount has been allocated on the basis of the merits of the relevant case, as advised by counsel. _Administrative proceedings_ On May 29, 2020, Pegaso received a note issued by the MIUR and including the National University Council’s (Consiglio Universitario Nazionale) negative opinion on the proposed amendment of Pegaso’s university internal regulations in order to allow examinations to take place online. In this respect, Pegaso is petitioning for the annulment of the note issued by MIUR before the Administrative Court (TAR) of Latium. On May 17, 2021, the Administrative Court (TAR) of Lazio with decision no. 5797 rejected Pegaso’s petition, stating that the possibility for students to take examinations online has been allowed only on an exceptional basis, due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. Pegaso intends to appeal against the decision of the Administrative Court (TAR) of Lazio within the required timeframe. As noted above, online exams have only been introduced following the COVID-19 pandemic by all universities; other than in the recently declared state of emergency, exams have always taken place physically also for online universities. _Tax audit by the Italian revenue agency_ On November 20, 2019, a tax audit was commenced by the Italian revenue agency concerning (i) the non-commercial nature of Pegaso in the years preceding its transformation into a limited company (a concern that should be overruled by the Provision Of Authentic Interpretation; see “Regulation—Transformation of _Pegaso into a private corporation”); (ii) the VAT treatment applicable to the promotion and support contract_ between Pegaso and Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. resolved on 31 December 2019 and (iii) the tax treatment of certain donations made by Pegaso in the 2015 and 2016 financial years in favour of two foundations. The revenue agency’s investigation and document acquisition activities are in progress and, with the support of Pegaso’s tax advisors, Pegaso is promptly responding to the requests and questions raised by promptly providing the agency with legal and tax reports on the main issues identified by it. As at the date hereof, the tax audit has not been concluded and no report of findings has been drawn up yet by the Italian revenue agency. Other than as stated above, Multiversity is not currently subject to any material legal, governmental, tax or arbitration proceedings that it believes could reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Leveraging on its ability to address a broad market with a unique quality offer, year over year Multiversity has consistently gained market share in the undergraduate education segment, becoming leader in the academic year 2017/2018 and, since then, consolidating its prominent position. Multiversity’s share of this market has grown by 19.2% over the past four years, and has captured an estimated over 55% of total market growth from academic year 2015/2016 to academic year 2019/2020. The online undergraduate market is concentrated around the top five players, which represented ~90% of the combined student population in academic year 2019/2020 and captured the majority of recent growth. The landscape of key online universities active in the Italian undergraduate market includes: - **Multiversity, through its two universities Pegaso and Mercatorum, has a leading market share in the online Italian market, with a combined market share of approximately 40% in the academic year 2019/2020 (Pegaso: 34.7%, Mercatorum: 5.2%). Multiversity Group’s market share has increased since academic year 2015/2016 by 14.4% for Pegaso and 4.8% for Mercatorum. Pegaso has by far the most extensive capillary network in the market and charges average annual tuition fees of €1,800[82]; - **Università Niccolò Cusano (“Cusano”) is the second-largest player, with a market share of 18.6% in academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 10.1% since academic year 2015/2016. Cusano charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €3,000[82]; - **E-Campus Università (“e-Campus”) is the third-largest market player with a market share of 15.0% in academic year 2019/2020, representing a market share gain of 2.8% since academic year 2015/2016. E-Campus charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €3,200[82]; - **Università Telematica Internazionale Uninettuno (“Uninettuno”) is the fourth-largest market player with a market share of 11.2% in academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 4.1% since academic year 2015/2016. Uninettuno charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €1,600. - **Guglielmo Marconi (“Marconi”) is the fifth-largest market player with a market share of 7.5% in academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 7.5% since academic year 2015/2016. Marconi charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €1,760[82]. _B) Postgraduate master’s market_ The postgraduate master’s market accounts for approximately 5% of the total higher education market, as opposed to 95% for the undergraduate market (95.0% in academic year 2019/2020). The online postgraduate market is concentrated but is similarly concentrated around five top players collectively representing almost 90% of the combined student population in academic year 2019/2020 and who have gained 21.6% in market share from all other competitors in the past 4 years. Furthermore, the top two players, Multiversity and e-Campus, together account for around 76% of the market, with e-Campus gaining the leading position over the last three years. The landscape of key online universities active in the postgraduate master’s market includes: - **e-Campus is the market leader, with a market share of 45.1% in academic year 2019/2020, a significant increase over the past three years considering that in academic year 2016/2017 it only had a market share of 2.3%; - **Multiversity is the second-largest player with a combined market share of approximately 31% in academic year 2019/2020 (Pegaso 29.4%, Mercatorum 1.6%). While doubling its enrolment in absolute terms over the past four years, Pegaso, like all other key players aside from Mercatorum, experienced a decline in market share since academic year 2015/2016 due to the strong growth of e-Campus (Multiversity Group’s combined market share declined by 13.2% over this period). Multiversity benefits from a unique partnership with the public sector thanks to the direct participation of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, which holds a circa 33% stake in Mercatorum; - **Cusano is the third-largest player with 9.8% market share in academic year 2019/2020, having conceded 6.2% in market share since academic year 2015/2016; 81 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), source MIUR data (extraction @6/2019), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis 82 Average discounted yearly tuition for undergraduate courses excluding regional taxes; un-weighted average discount shown 116 ----- - **Uninettuno is the fourth-largest player with a market share of 2.3% in the academic year 2019/2020, but has almost halved its market share since academic year 2015/2016. - **Guglielmo Marconi is the fifth-largest player with a market share of 1.2% in the academic year 2019/2020, but has lost 0.6% in market share since academic year 2015/2016. The Italian university market, initially closed to online universities, was officially opened to online competition in 2003 with a ministry decree in an effort to improve the percentage of Italian population with a higher education degree (one of the lowest of Europe). Since the opening of the online Italian higher education market in 2003, 11 private online universities were established, with online universities enrolling their first students in 2006. There are no public online universities and the online university market is structurally closed to new entrants, as no further licenses are currently expected to be issued. In particular, the restriction for the establishment of online universities in Italy is usually extended every 3 years, with the publication of the Ministerial Decree governing Italian universities’ academic planning. The latest Ministerial Decree published in March 2021 (Decree n. 289 of 25 March 2021) confirmed the restriction until the academic year 2023/2024. As a result of the restriction on the establishment of new online universities, barriers to entry are particularly high for any potential new entrant, whether domestic or from abroad. Even if the restriction were to be lifted, prospective market entrants would face significant upfront investments, in terms of time and resources, to catch up with established online players, like Multiversity, that has already established a nation-wide presence, superior technological platform, well-recognized brand and significant scale. Traditional universities have historically limited their focus and investments in online education platforms as a result of various factors: - **Structural complexity of a hybrid education model: arising from the coexistence of traditional and online learning for the courses being offered and organizational complexity and teaching methodology change not easy to replicate. There might also be resistance to change from academics, which tend to favour traditional university teaching compared to online methods; - **Infrastructural gaps and investments required: given the geographic concentration of university facilities (generally in a single city, sometimes even a single campus/building) they lack the nationwide exam venues/ network reach of online universities. Furthermore, the need for IT investments to adapt the business models is significant, both in terms of economic resources, as well as time and technical capabilities. Decisions over these matters typically take longer times in traditional universities, in particular for public-owned universities, given strategic agendas which do not prioritize online education and budget constraints; - **Perceived risks around potential brand dilution: for some of the most prominent names in the traditional education space, given the different offer and target markets. During the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional universities were forced by the circumstances to offer online classes, but this is seen as only a temporary solution, with some already returning to forms of traditional education in the academic year 2021/2022. Most importantly, traditional universities cannot offer a permanent online solution without Ministry approval.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Lessons can be followed from anywhere via the online platform, with video-recorded classes lasting c. 25-30 minutes each, available 24/7 to students. Study packs are provided for each lesson, as well as numerous online mock exams. The offering is complemented by flexible additional services, such as dedicated tutors, online chat client and specific forums for both students and professors. Traditional universities, by contrast, generally only offer lessons on campus, with fixed schedules lasting 1-2 hours, and classes are usually not recorded.

Students are able to access all video lessons, class materials and mock exams; interact via video conference with professors and tutors; and even attend exams online, all through user-friendly Pegaso and Mercatorum websites or mobile apps (first launched in 2018). Superior user experience is also at heart when Multiversity creates its content for these platforms: while professors create the content, they are supported throughout by Multiversity IT staff who ensure that materials produced are optimized to be deployed across all its channels. Multiversity is currently serving one of the largest online student communities in Italy and has a broad social network presence to further engage with its students. The company has developed its platform mostly in-house or by personalizing open-source software, achieving a strong back-end able to deliver seamlessly across all platforms and devices. Multiversity has also fully transitioned its business to cloud-based servers provided by Amazon Web Services’ (“AWS”) cloud datacenters, and currently hosts 150 terabyte/month of data storage and relies on a multi-server system, with a load balancer to manage user traffic overload. This cloud structure adds an additional disaster recovery horizontal layer (through AWS) to the existing redundant copy stored in the company’s Multimedia Centre in Naples. Multiversity’s platform, in addition to leveraging the latest technology available such as facial recognition to confirm student identity, offers advanced proprietary features such as a suggestion tool for its students (enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning) that prompts highly relevant content to each individual based on their career path, grades and progress. Quality of the IT platform is recognized by students compared to peers and traditional universities, demonstrating students are highly satisfied with the technological tools at their disposal. 29 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), source MEF, Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis 30 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), source Linkedin Recruiter (January 2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis. 31 Alumni Pegaso (i.e. with a Pegaso degree both Undergraduate and Master) on Linkedin. 32 Market leader in industrial in ex-equo with Università Cusano. 15 -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

In the academic years 2018/2019-2019/2020, the number of students grew by 22% for the overall online market. This growth was embedded with a certain amount visibility, as undergraduates (whose courses have a longer duration) and freshmen (the vast majority of which stay with Multiversity up to completion of their degrees) had a significant incidence on overall figures. In particular, undergraduate courses at Multiversity have an average duration of 2.8 years and a strong conversion rate (40% of graduates from 3-year degree programs apply for 1- or 2-year master’s degrees). In addition, with Multiversity Group churn rates below those of the broader online market (approximately 5% vs. 6%[33]), the potential negative impact on the overall student base from early exits is limited, granting additional stability. The average backlog for Pegaso in academic years 2017/2018-2020/2021 was approximately 55%. These dynamics are of particular relevance given that approximately 55% of the Group’s 2020 revenues were generated from undergraduate programs, thus allowing valuable visibility on future top-line evolution. Operating leverage is high, on the back of a significant business model scalability. In particular, the variable component of our cost base is only related to the contributions recognized to the E-learning Centre Points, which grow as the business grows. For instance, during the year ended December 31, 2020, contributions recognized to the E-learning Centre Points accounted for 13% of our total revenues (and 26% of our total cost base), whereas the advertising costs represented 14%, educational and didactic personnel costs were 4%, headquarters and nondidactic personnel costs were 6%, rental costs were 2% and we recorded 9% of our total revenues for other expenses. As such, and given the asset-light nature of our business—with investments concentrated our around IT platform—as our business grows, profitability and cash-flow based metrics are expected to grow more than proportionally.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Not only is the market expected to be larger in absolute size (reaching 379,000 undergraduate students in academic year 2025/2026[34] out of a total addressable base of approximately 1,000,000 individuals, vs. 135,000 as of academic year 2019/2020); it will also benefit from a different mix in terms of levers of growth, both from a geographic and student profile perspective. In particular, there is significant geographic white space to be addressed, especially in the Italian Northern regions. While originally Southern Italy has seen the largest number of undergraduate students, strong growth in the online undergraduate market will come from the Italian Northern regions, increasing from circa 27% of the total undergraduate online student base to circa 34% in academic year 2025/2026, adding circa 60,000 new students and doubling the current absolute number. In addition, first-timers—which have been the highest growth category over 2015/2016—2019/2020 academic years, with a 32% CAGR—will continue to increase their relative incidence versus overall undergraduate student base, moving from 33% in academic year 2015/2016 to 47% expected by academic year 2025/2026. Multiversity in-house skills and know-how allow the Group to benefit from several opportunities for additional growth beyond its existing perimeter without the need for significant investments. These opportunities include B2B and continuous learning, becoming a technology provider and international expansion. B2B and continuous learning There are significant opportunities to put the technological platform at the service of a number of prospective clients for a variety of potential needs. In particular, the pandemic forced many companies to implement distance learning initiatives for their employees. Multiversity is already equipped to tap this opportunity through its proprietary technology platform and in-house content. Leveraging our technological capabilities and the know-how and capabilities of our academic staff, 33 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis 34 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis on MIUR data for historicals, forecasts based on Third Party Commercial Advisor estimates 16 ----- Multiversity could offer customized platforms, content and innovative learning programs for companies or specific industries, coupled with our nationwide capillary presence through which we can also offer in-person lessons. Technological platform—“White Label” Multiversity’s proprietary platform and in-house technological capabilities could also be exploited as a product to be sold to third parties. In order to avoid potential conflicts of interests or providing competitors with our technology, this offering could be tailored to K-12 or traditional universities addressing distinct student populations. International expansion Although organic international expansion is rendered difficult by divergent regulatory environments and requirements which reduce our ability to replicate or scale our model, there are potential opportunities in selected international markets where Italian degrees are relevant and attractive. In particular, we are currently developing an offering in Turkey, and will selectively expand to other countries by leveraging the same content and platform to international students seeking an Italian degree recognized across the European Union.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

More convenient alternative Online education platforms offer students significantly decreased all-in costs of education versus traditional universities. Tuition fees are aligned to those of competing public traditional universities, however since courses can be attended remotely there is no need for students to acquire or rent accommodation to be close to the university (that is often one of the most sizeable and prohibitive implicit costs of university attendance) or pay for transit. Moreover, students can realize significant savings on course materials, given that all study materials are made available online and are included in the tuition fee. In traditional universities, by contrast, the primary source of information used in courses is physical textbooks, which students often need to purchase at significant cost. Multiversity’s pricing is highly competitive, both among other online universities and, to an even higher extent, when compared to traditional universities. Pegaso, for example, offers an average undergraduate preferential tuition fee per year of circa €1,800, compared to circa €3,000 per year for Cusano and e-Campus. Officially recognized degree and equivalent legal value university degree The degrees are accredited, have the same legal value and are verified in the same way as public and private universities degrees in Italy by the MIUR. The Italian national agency for the evaluation of university and research systems (Agenzia Nazionale di _Valutazione del Sistema Universitario e della Ricerca or “ANVUR”) periodically inspects online and traditional_ universities to evaluate their services and provide them with an official accreditation. Pegaso and Mercatorum received top marks among online competitors in their latest accreditation visits in 2017. Multiversity’s wide and robust quality offering is continuously innovated through new courses (such as Big Data approved for Mercatorum) to adapt to changing trends and needs. Multiversity’s reputation and brand awareness has benefited from the experience and breadth of its academic staff, which includes 76 full and associate professors (university professor holding a chair hired indefinitely), 155 extraordinary professors (experts on the specific research development sector), 479 contract professors (discipline expert with renewable annual assignment), 16 researchers (scholar of specific research fields) and 88 tutors developing cutting-edge proprietary content. Among its speakers and guests, Multiversity has hosted a breadth of personalities including former ministers, general secretary of the largest Italian labor union and award-winning film directors and screenwriters. Capillary Physical Network and Iconic Venues Proximity and ease of access to local infrastructure are key determinants for students when choosing between traditional forms of higher education and online and, within the latter, selecting one university over another. Multiversity enjoys a unique presence in Italy thanks to Pegaso’s approximately 100 iconic exam locations in the most important Italian cities and a difficult to replicate network of approximately 820 Pegaso and 800 Mercatorum ELCPs located throughout the country. The numerous locations across Italy allow students to sit for exams close to their home cities. The use of iconic buildings as exam centers is also a contributor to establishing strong brand recognition with a unique positioning and brand awareness, not only among the students’ population, but also among all the members of academic staff. The large E-learning Center network of affiliates guarantees Multiversity a capillary presence across the country, offering orientation services and information to new potential students with a variety of different academic profiles, interests and backgrounds. This local presence throughout Italy allows flexibility of strategy to adapt to future market changes and proximity to students. Effective commercial approach across traditional and online channels Unlike their traditional counterparts, online universities generally display a more committed approach towards marketing and advertising, engaging with potential and existing students both online and via traditional channels such as billboards, television and radio. Multiversity has developed a particularly strong position across the spectrum, thanks to a well-developed multi-channel marketing strategy coupled with its capillary nationwide network. 13 ----- Pegaso shows a higher social media following than most of online and traditional competitors, on the back of strong student engagement. This level of interaction was aided in part by targeted advertising with exclusive partners, such as a co-branding campaign with the movie Spider-man: Homecoming in 2017, and by airing TV spots during peak times, for example during widely-followed shows in Italy. The effectiveness of Multiversity online marketing strategy is particularly relevant when considering the increasing penetration of first time students in the Italian online higher education channel, with such category— by nature, given the younger age - being more receptive and used to online forms of advertising vs. traditional ones. Additionally, Pegaso and Mercatorum have established and consistently grown their unique network via framework agreements with more than 1,500 associations including public bodies, trade unions, the Chamber of Commerce, municipalities, cultural associations, private companies and sports associations. This network is over six times larger than any of the key competitors’ and continues to grow, with approximately 350 new agreements concluded by Pegaso in the last year alone, 1.6 times the number of total agreements that the second player in the market had in 2020. These framework agreements are fundamental to Multiversity’s business model, as they increase the possibility to secure a captive customer base. Credible and Valid Access to Top Quality Employers Multiversity’s strong link with the Italian Chamber of Commerce (through its stake in Mercatorum) allow Multiversity’s students to be best positioned to meet Italy’s future employment needs. Multiversity’s offering is tailored to respond to the future demands of the Italian job market. The latest estimates by Unioncamere relating to employment needs between 2020 and 2024 predict that almost 900,000 graduates will find a job between 2020 and 2024. Specifically, in the fields in which Multiversity offers degree and other programs, the expected need will be circa 120,000 graduates in Economics & Business Administration, circa 120,000 in Engineering, circa 105,000 in Teaching and Training and circa 90,000 in Law, collectively accounting for approximately 50% of the total projected demand. _Demand for graduates in the Italian job market and Multiversity offer[28]_ Multiversity single courses, including FIT (courses related to anthropo-phsycho-pedagological disciplines for students striving to become 2nd grade teachers), FORM, and Single Courses, are aligned with Public Administration hiring trends through “Concorso Pubblico” (i.e. public hiring tenders that require a specific 28 Undergraduate courses include 3-year Bachelor degrees, 2-year Master’s degree and 5-year degree (“ciclo unico or magistrale”) for law students. “Economics & Business Administration” includes Tourism Sciences (x2), Business Administration (x2), Sport Management, Economic Science, Management, Languages and Markets, International Relations for the Economic Development and Management Engineering (x2). “Engineering” includes Civil Engineering, Safety Engineering, Computer Engineering and Infrastructure Engineering for Sustainable Mobility. “Teaching” Includes Sport Science, Educational Science, Literature, Humanities and Educational Science, Philosophy and Ethics, Pedagogical Science and Modern Languages. “Law” includes Law and Legal Science. 14 ----- exam). These hiring trends were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing public tenders by 60-70%[29] compared to previous years, but a rebound is expected as these tend to be recurring hiring tenders over the years.

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1218,"ONLINE UNIVERSITIES ARE CONSIDERED AS SIMILAR, IF NOT BETTER, THAN TRADITIONAL ONES FOR QUALITY OF TEACHING",1218.10,,1218.10.1,,"----- Pegaso, the largest and most widely known of Multiversity’s online universities, has the broadest academic reach (with seven undergraduate degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single-cycle five-year degree and over 250 higher education / specialization and postgraduate master’s courses), offering courses across a variety of disciplines including law, engineering, economics and literature, among others. Mercatorum, while smaller than Pegaso, is best placed to capture emerging educational trends in fields such as design, food, big data and sustainable mobility on the back of its strong ties to the territory and business communities, leveraging the partnership with the Italian Chamber of Commerce (owner of a 33% stake in Mercatorum) and a highly tailored offering (14 undergraduate degrees, four specialist master’s degrees and one PhD programme[22]). Finally, other assets, such as Certipass (international certifications for digital competencies and IT skills), Principe di Napoli and the academies, complement the breadth of the Multiversity portfolio and support the increasing diversification of the business with no overlapping of educational contents between the two online universities. The effectiveness of Multiversity’s business model also resides in its distribution platform, which allows it to retain full and direct contact with students over the course of their enrollment through the control of distribution and quality of education content. Students can be oriented directly by the universities or by the E-learning Center Points (“ELCPs”). The ELCPs network of approximately 3.000[23] local affiliates guarantees Multiversity a capillary presence all over the country, offering (in the case of Pegaso and Mercatorum) information and orientation assistance and (in the case of Certipass) EIPASS Certifications and related services to new potential students with a variety of different academic profiles, interests and backgrounds. This local presence throughout Italy allows flexibility of strategy to adapt to future market changes as well as proximity to students. All ELCPs are managed by external third parties that have entered into accreditation agreements with Multiversity’s institutions. See “Business—Material Contracts—Accreditation Agreements for ELCPs.” _A) Undergraduate market_ Multiversity enjoys a strong leadership position in the online undergraduate market, with a market share of circa 40%[24] as of academic year 2019/2020, more than two times bigger than the number two player in the online undergraduate education universe. Leveraging on its ability to address a broad market with a unique quality offer, year over year Multiversity has consistently gained market share in the undergraduate education segment, becoming leader in the academic year 2017/2018 and, since then, consolidating its prominent position. Multiversity’s share of this market has grown by 19.2% over the past four years, and has captured an estimated over 55% of total market growth from academic year 2015/2016 to academic year 2019/2020. The online undergraduate market is concentrated around the top five players, which represented ~90% of the combined student population in academic year 2019/2020 and captured the majority of recent growth. The landscape of key online universities active in the Italian undergraduate market includes: - **Multiversity, through its two universities Pegaso and Mercatorum, has a leading market share in the online Italian market, with a combined market share of approximately 40% in the academic year 2019/2020 (Pegaso: 34.7%, Mercatorum: 5.2%). Multiversity Group’s market share has increased since academic year 2015/2016 by 14.4% for Pegaso and 4.8% for Mercatorum. Pegaso has by far the most extensive capillary network in the market and charges average annual tuition fees of €1,800[25]; - **Università Niccolò Cusano (“Cusano”) is the second-largest player, with a market share of 18.6% in academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 10.1% since academic year 2015/2016. Cusano charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €3,000[25]; - **E-Campus Università (“e-Campus”) is the third-largest market player with a market share of 15.0% in academic year 2019/2020, representing a market share gain of 2.8% since academic year 2015/2016. E-Campus charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €3,200[25]; - **Università Telematica Internazionale Uninettuno (“Uninettuno”) is the fourth-largest market player with a market share of 11.2% in academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 4.1% since academic year 2015/2016. Uninettuno charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €1,600. - **Guglielmo Marconi (“Marconi”) is the fifth-largest market player with a market share of 7.5% in academic year 2019/2020, representing a decline in market share of 7.5% since academic year 2015/2016. Marconi charges average annual tuition fees of approximately €1,760[25]. 22 In partnership with Pegaso 23 Certain ELCPs are accredited by more than one Multiversity institution 24 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), source MIUR data (extraction @6/2019), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis 25 Average discounted yearly tuition for undergraduate courses excluding regional taxes; un-weighted average discount shown 10 ----- _B) Postgraduate master’s market_ The postgraduate master’s market accounts for approximately 5% of the total higher education market, as opposed to 95% for the undergraduate market (95.0% in academic year 2019/2020). The online postgraduate market is concentrated but is similarly concentrated around five top players collectively representing almost 90% of the combined student population in academic year 2019/2020 and who have gained 21.6% in market share from all other competitors in the past 4 years. Furthermore, the top two players, Multiversity and e-Campus, together account for around 76% of the market, with e-Campus gaining the leading position over the last three years. The landscape of key online universities active in the postgraduate master’s market includes: - **e-Campus is the market leader, with a market share of 45.1% in academic year 2019/2020, a significant increase over the past three years considering that in academic year 2016/2017 it only had a market share of 2.3%; - **Multiversity is the second-largest player with a combined market share of approximately 31% in academic year 2019/2020 (Pegaso 29.4%, Mercatorum 1.6%). While doubling its enrolment in absolute terms over the past four years, Pegaso, like all other key players aside from Mercatorum, experienced a decline in market share since academic year 2015/2016 due to the strong growth of e-Campus (Multiversity Group’s combined market share declined by 13.2% over this period). Multiversity benefits from a unique partnership with the public sector thanks to the direct participation of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, which holds a circa 33% stake in Mercatorum; - **Cusano is the third-largest player with 9.8% market share in academic year 2019/2020, having conceded 6.2% in market share since academic year 2015/2016; - **Uninettuno is the fourth-largest player with a market share of 2.3% in the academic year 2019/2020, but has almost halved its market share since academic year 2015/2016. - **Guglielmo Marconi is the fifth-largest player with a market share of 1.2% in the academic year 2019/2020, but has lost 0.6% in market share since academic year 2015/2016. The Italian university market, initially closed to online universities, was officially opened to online competition in 2003 with a ministry decree in an effort to improve the percentage of Italian population with a higher education degree (one of the lowest of Europe). Since the opening of the online Italian higher education market in 2003, 11 private online universities were established, with online universities enrolling their first students in 2006. There are no public online universities and the online university market is structurally closed to new entrants, as no further licenses are currently expected to be issued. In particular, the restriction for the establishment of online universities in Italy is usually extended every 3 years, with the publication of the Ministerial Decree governing Italian universities’ academic planning. The latest Ministerial Decree published in March 2021 (Decree n. 289 of 25 March 2021) confirmed the restriction until the academic year 2023/2024. As a result of the restriction on the establishment of new online universities, barriers to entry are particularly high for any potential new entrant, whether domestic or from abroad. Even if the restriction were to be lifted, prospective market entrants would face significant upfront investments, in terms of time and resources, to catch up with established online players, like Multiversity, that has already established a nation-wide presence, superior technological platform, well-recognized brand and significant scale. Traditional universities have historically limited their focus and investments in online education platforms as a result of various factors: - **Structural complexity of a hybrid education model: arising from the coexistence of traditional and online learning for the courses being offered and organizational complexity and teaching methodology change not easy to replicate. There might also be resistance to change from academics, which tend to favour traditional university teaching compared to online methods; - **Infrastructural gaps and investments required: given the geographic concentration of university facilities (generally in a single city, sometimes even a single campus/building) they lack the nationwide exam venues/ network reach of online universities. Furthermore, the need for IT investments to adapt the business models is significant, both in terms of economic resources, as well as time and technical capabilities. Decisions over these matters typically take longer times in traditional universities, in particular for public-owned universities, given strategic agendas which do not prioritize online education and budget constraints; - **Perceived risks around potential brand dilution: for some of the most prominent names in the traditional education space, given the different offer and target markets. 11 ----- During the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional universities were forced by the circumstances to offer online classes, but this is seen as only a temporary solution, with some already returning to forms of traditional education in the academic year 2021/2022. Most importantly, traditional universities cannot offer a permanent online solution without Ministry approval.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

See “Risk Factors—The _interests of the principal shareholder may conflict with your interests_ as a holder of the Notes—Creditors under the Revolving Credit _Facility, certain hedging liabilities and certain debt that we may incur in the future will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes”_ and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement.”_ The security interests in the Collateral may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability. See _“Description_ _of_ _the_ _Notes—Security,” “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees _and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and_ “Risk Factors—The interests of the principal shareholder may _conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes.”_ The security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. See _“Description_ _of_ _Certain_ _Financing _Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_ Guarantors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will not initially be guaranteed. Subject to certain Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein), sufficient guarantors will accede within 120 days of the earlier of (a) the Post-Closing Reorganisation and (b) the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date such that entities contributing 80% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group (and each Material Company (being each contributing 5% or more of Consolidated EBITDA of the Group on an unconsolidated basis) located in Guarantor Jurisdictions (as defined herein) become, subject to Agreed Security Principles, guarantors), see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— _Revolving Credit Facility—Guarantees”._ To the extent that guarantees are granted prior to the Post-Closing Reorganisation, proceeds from a virtual portion of the Notes, equal to an aggregate principal amount of € (“Tranche A”), will be used to fund, directly or indirectly, the purchase price for the Acquisition and fees and expenses in connection therewith, and proceeds from a separate virtual portion of the Notes, equal to an aggregate principal amount of € (“Tranche B”), will be used to fund, directly or indirectly, to fund certain transaction costs associated with the Transactions and the refinancing of certain 27 ----- existing indebtedness (if any) of the Target or its subsidiaries. For more information on the Italian law considerations applicable to Tranche A and Tranche B and the related limitations on guarantees and security interests granted by Italian companies, see “Limitations _on Validity and Enforceability of the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Italy— Limitations on Granting Security Interests and Guarantees under Italian Law” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Collateral and any future guarantees or security of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.” For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of_ the Notes is aimed at identifying the separate portions of the proceeds being used to consummate the Acquisition and the various elements of the refinancing of the Group Existing Debt, respectively, and will not entail issuing separate identifiers (ISINs or common codes) for each such tranche. See “Listing and General Information.” Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Acquisition Closing Date, which will be immediately following the consummation of the Offering, the proceeds of the Offering, the Bridge to Cash Facility, amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Equity Contribution will be used by the Issuer to fund the Multiversity Investment and to pay the estimated costs and expenses associated with the Transactions. See “Risk Factors”. Optional Redemption: . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or after , 2022 at the redemption prices as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” At any time prior to, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or part of Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption plus a “make-whole” premium, as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional _Redemption.”_ Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless required by law. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, if the Issuer, any Guarantor or the paying agent is required by law to withhold or deduct such taxes with respect to a payment on any Note, such Issuer or Guarantor will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by each holder after such withholding is not less than the amount that would have been received in the absence of the withholding. The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy and therefore payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. Subject to and as set forth in “Description of _the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay_ any additional amounts to holders of the Notes if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time) (“Decree No. 239”) or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time) (“Decree No. 461”), except, in the case of Decree No. 239 and Decree No. 461, where the procedures required under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461, as applicable, in 28 ----- order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied with due to solely the actions or omissions of the Issuer or its agents. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Although we believe that, under current law, Italian substitute tax will not be imposed under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 where a holder of Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy included in the list provided for by Italian Ministerial Decree dated 4 September 1996, as amended from time to time, or, as from the tax year in which the Ministerial Decree to be issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, let. c) of Decree No. 239 is effective, included in the list therein provided (the “White List”) and such holder of Notes complies with certain certification requirements, there is no assurance that this will be the case. Moreover, holders of the Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 after the date hereof, including any change in the white list countries. See “Description of the _Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Prospective purchasers of Notes should_ consult their tax advisors as to the overall tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes, including, in particular, the effect of any state, regional or local tax laws of any country or territory. Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction are announced and become effective on or after the issuance of the Notes that would require the Issuer or the Guarantors (if any) to pay additional amounts (as defined in “Description of the Notes— _Withholding Taxes”), the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but_ not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. Change of Control** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of _the Notes—Change of Control.”_ Certain Covenants** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments; - make certain other restricted payments; - create or permit to exist certain liens; - impose restrictions on the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends; - transfer or sell certain assets; - merge or consolidate with other entities; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. 29 ----- Certain of the covenants will be suspended if the relevant Notes obtain and maintain an investment-grade rating. Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain _Covenants.”_ Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We have not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the Notes under the securities laws in any jurisdiction (including by way of an exchange offer).",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

(7) We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for bad debt accruals and non-recurring items. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP Measure and the term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under Italian GAAP, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Consequently, the use of Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it excludes items that the we do not believe are indicative of the Group’s ongoing operating performance and allows us to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods. We believe that adjusting for these items that are not directly related to the operational performance of the Group and increases comparability and enables a better understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with Italian GAAP or IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in accordance with Italian GAAP or IFRS. For a more detailed description of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as analytical tool, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” (8) We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as the ratio between Adjusted EBITDA and the value of production.

Individual courses offered by Multiversity’s academic institutions are also subject to various accreditation requirements. In order to operate, Multiversity’s academic institutions have received and maintained various accreditations and permissions from the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (“MIUR”), as well as from certain curriculum providers and examination bodies. The accreditation system envisaged by the regulations provides that all courses forming part of an institution’s educational offering, except master’s courses, must be licensed every three years, and the relevant institution must undergo a review process every five years in order to maintain its licensing. The procedure for obtaining and maintaining the relevant license varies depending on whether the course is newly created or already existing. See “Regulation” for further information. As a prerequisite to obtaining and maintaining specific licenses for each course, an institution must itself have obtained its general license to operate from the MIUR. To maintain these accreditations and permissions, Multiversity’s Italian academic institutions must meet standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, staff, administrative capability and resources. In particular, Pegaso and Mercatorum, as Italian private universities, are subject to a periodic accreditation assessment carried out by the Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes (Agenzia Nazionale di Valutazione del Sistema Universitario e _della Ricerca or “ANVUR”), the entity to which the MIUR has delegated the task of carrying out a periodic_ qualitative assessment of the activities carried out by Italian universities and research institutes. The periodic accreditation assessments are processed following on-site visits to universities by an ad hoc commission of experts appointed by ANVUR. The periodic accreditation process is carried out in three phases: (i) a remote examination of the documentation made available by the university to the commission, (ii) the actual on-site visit in order to examine the degree programs and the departments selected by ANVUR for each university, and (iii) the drafting of a report by the commission. For further information on the legislative framework and licensing and accreditation process to which Multiversity’s academic institutions are subject, please see “Regulation”. Depending on the outcome of ANVUR’s periodic accreditation assessment, a negative score could be assigned to Pegaso or Mercatorum, which in turn could lead to the revocation of their authorizations, in the event that Pegaso or Mercatorum is unable to improve its score as a result of continuing material weakness following subsequent reassessment. Inspections could also lead to downgrading of the rating assigned to any of Multiversity’s academic institutions. Any such event could result in the temporary or permanent cessation of all or part of Multiversity’s business and/or a reduction of the academic institutions’ ability to enroll new students or attract qualified personnel. Multiversity’s reputation would also be severely impacted. In addition, the jurisdictions in which Multiversity operates (being, as at the date hereof, almost exclusively Italy and, to a limited extent, Malta, although Multiversity degrees are recognized across the European Union) may at any time impose additional laws, regulations or licensing requirements on online academic institutions, or even on academic institutions in general. Such new laws could oblige Multiversity or Multiversity’s individual 41 ----- institutions to obtain additional licenses, permits or accreditations, which could in turn lead it to incur significant costs, limit or delay its ability to operate and/or to expand its business in such jurisdiction in line with its strategic objectives. In addition, in the event that compliance with such legislative changes were to be deemed too operationally or financially burdensome by Multiversity, Multiversity could cease to operate in the relevant jurisdiction altogether. In particular, Pegaso was the first university in Italy to become a limited company and commercial entity. At the time of Pegaso’s transformation into a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) in 2019, both the Italian Council of State (Consiglio di Stato) and the MIUR issued favourable opinions on the matter, without raising objections to the specific transaction in the absence of any express legislative provision to the contrary. Both authorities however noted in their opinions that existing legislation does not expressly regulate the status of universities as private corporations, and that this could, impact how the regulatory framework is applied to open universities that take the form of private corporations. The authorities therefore called for the government to consider proposing legislative reforms in order to exclude the risk of encountering incompatibility issues in the practical application of the current legal framework to corporations. It cannot be excluded that the authorities could in the future consider legislative proposals in order to update the legal framework. Were such reforms to be passed into law, it cannot be excluded that Pegaso, as the first university to transform into a private corporation, could be required to comply with enhanced legal requirements or to implement organisational or structural changes, thereby potentially facing increased costs and hindering its ability to conduct its current business effectively. In addition should any further universities of the Group be similarly transformed, they would face similar uncertainties. See further “Regulation—Establishment of Pegaso and Mercatorum” and “Regulation— _Transformation of Pegaso into a private corporation”._",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Any of the circumstances described above are likely to have a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Regulatory changes and investigations may be driven by political and public opinion affecting providers of higher education.","The success of Multiversity’s business depends significantly on compliance of its subsidiaries (including its academic institutions) with legislation and oversight by the MIUR, mainly through ANVUR. The regulation of alternative providers of higher education in Italy is, to a significant degree, subject to political and public opinion on the role of the private sector in the provision of education. This may lead to the implementation of policies that promote the preferential treatment of publicly-funded higher education providers over private universities or higher education institutions’ ability to recruit students, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on Multiversity’s business and results of operations. Although Multiversity has stringent procedures in place to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations to which it is subject, if other alternative providers abuse the system, Multiversity’s reputation may be negatively impacted by association, thus leading to a negative impact on Multiversity’s business and financial position. See also ‘‘—Any negative impact on the reputation of Multiversity’s institutions and sector could adversely affect its _business’’ below._ In addition, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities in Italy or in any other jurisdiction in which Multiversity operates will not impose restrictions on the level of tuition fees charged by its universities in the future or any other material changes in the applicable requirements to Multiversity’s operations. Changes in such regulations, which can often occur at short notice, could have a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, the cost structure and the business model of Multiversity. If the regulatory framework governing the levels of tuition fee is altered in a manner which negatively impacts Multiversity’s tuition fee structure, its operating margins and prospects could be adversely affected.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Pursuant to the legislative framework in place as at the date of this Offering Memorandum (specifically and most recently, Italian Decree no. 289 of March 25, 2021 (as may be amended or replaced, “Decree 289”)), no new licenses can be granted in order to incorporate new online universities. Currently in Italy, eleven online universities have been authorised by the MIUR. The prohibition on the granting of new licenses has been in place for over ten years. 42 ----- Decree 289 has a duration of three years, and will last until academic year 2023/2024. Should it not be extended or replaced by a similar law after such time, or should the broader legislative framework be amended at any point in time in order to repeal Decree 289, allowing the granting of further authorizations to new online institutions, Multiversity would face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including, for example, established colleges and universities that had not previously offered an online education program. Multiversity may be unable to compete successfully against future market players (for example, if Multiversity is unable to differentiate its educational offering from those of its competitors) and may therefore face difficulties in maintaining or increasing tuition fee levels and enrolling, retaining students and staff, thereby increasing its expenditure in student and staff recruitment and retention activities. In addition, Multiversity’s institutions may face increased difficulties in locating and engaging third parties as e-learning centers, thereby limiting or reducing its geographical presence across Italy. Furthermore, Pegaso and/or Mercatorum could lose their market leadership position in the face of new competition, with a knock-on effect on their reputation. These competitive factors could cause Multiversity’s enrollment figures, revenues and profitability to materially decrease.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The platform was developed mostly in-house in reliance on open-source software and is run on servers hosted by Amazon Web Services’ cloud datacenters. Although Multiversity has established and maintains cybersecurity frameworks that are developed and updated internally, including a system that monitors the platform and code transactions on it, its IT systems and platforms may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, data corruption, network or server failure, computer viruses, security breaches, data theft or leak of confidential information such as exams content or exam results, natural disasters, third-party intrusions or other technical malfunctions despite, where possible, efforts to prevent such damage or interruption. As a result, Multiversity’s business could be disrupted if any of the technologies that Multiversity uses to deliver its programs are interrupted or fail. See “Business—Technology Platform” for further details. Multiversity’s business model is entirely reliant on the proper functioning of its e-learning platform and, more generally, of its IT systems. If Multiversity is unable to continue to maintain or update its IT platform, it may have difficulty delivering its online services. In addition, any failure to deliver its online services would have an adverse impact on Multiversity’s operations, damage its reputation and limit its ability to attract and retain students. Any damage or malfunction to any of these technologies may require capital expenditure to rectify and would necessarily cause delays in Multiversity’s operations. Any material disruption or slowdown, including those caused by Multiversity’s failure to successfully upgrade its technologies and systems, could cause some information, including prospective student applications or student work product, to be lost or delayed when processed. Furthermore, e-learning institutions are vulnerable to data breaches by students themselves or by third parties, particularly with the aim of retrieving official examination papers ahead of the examinations themselves in order to leak them to all or part of the student body. Such loss, delay or theft could result in loss of reputation and student dissatisfaction, which could in turn adversely affect Multiversity’s reputation and business. Moreover, as a result of such a loss or delay, Multiversity could be involved in remedial actions or legal proceedings which in turn might have a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

This data includes confidential information such as confidential exam content or information belonging to it, its students and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of individuals, including employees. Multiversity’s operations are based in Europe, and are therefore subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR provides for stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection of personal data, and any failure to comply with it could subject Multiversity to significant monetary forfeitures and other penalties. In particular, Multiversity’s online universities routinely process and retain sensitive personal data, including specific information regarding individuals’ ethnicity, gender and disability information or information regarding student performance. The processing and storage of such information is highly regulated under GDPR and other applicable privacy regimes, and any mishandling of this data could subject Multiversity to significant regulatory penalties or civil liabilities. As such, any breach in data privacy protection regulations could have a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business and could lead to a negative reputational impact. In addition, if the security measures Multiversity uses to protect personal data are ineffective due to a systems failure or other reasons (including ones not caused by Multiversity), Multiversity could be subject to liability, including for breach of data protection legislation, claims of invasion of privacy, impersonation, unauthorized purchases or other claims. It is also possible that Multiversity’s employees could, fraudulently or otherwise, misuse personal data and Multiversity would be liable for such misuse. If Multiversity does not maintain suitable controls and processes that comply with the GDPR, its ability to attract and retain students may be adversely impacted, its reputation may deteriorate and its business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Multiversity could also incur significant expenses in connection with remedying any potential security breaches, by either settling any resulting claims against Multiversity, defending itself in court or administrative proceedings and putting in place additional measures in order to further protect itself from the threat of these breaches. In addition, any failure to protect personal information may adversely impact Multiversity’s ability to attract and retain students, cause its reputation to deteriorate and materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

In particular, Multiversity relies on trademark protection in Italy and worldwide to protect its rights to the trademark ‘Pegaso’ and ‘EIPASS’, among others, and its distinctive logos and other marks associated with its programs and services. It has registered 40 domain names and 12 trademarks, as well as the algorithm underlying its IT platform’s flowchart, among other software registrations (see “Business— _Intellectual Property” for further information). Moreover, in the ordinary course of its business, Multiversity_ develops intellectual property of many kinds, also in collaboration with its commercial partners, that is or will be the subject of copyright or other protections. Such intellectual property includes but is not limited to didactic and research materials and business know-how, as well as its e-learning platform which has been developed by it entirely in-house. There is no guarantee that third parties (including its commercial and academic business partners) will not in the future infringe or misappropriate its trademarks, brand names or other intellectual property, and that any present or future measures enacted by Multiversity to protect its intellectual property and enforce its rights are or will be sufficient. Furthermore, Multiversity also may be involved in disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning certain other intellectual property that it utilizes, and Multiversity may not prevail in these disputes which may also incur significant costs for the company. Third parties may bring claims against Multiversity alleging infringement or violation of their intellectual property. Some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad and it may not be possible for Multiversity to conduct its operations in such a way as to avoid infringement of those intellectual property rights. Any claims of infringement or alleged 44 ----- infringement of intellectual property rights could negatively impact Multiversity’s reputation and branding, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Multiversity might face penalties and charges if found liable for any infringements or might be required to comply with injunctions against it to prevent further infringement. This could affect Multiversity’s reputation and its prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Multiversity’s financial performance depends in part on its ability to maintain or increase its tuition fees.","The principal factors that could have an adverse impact on Multiversity’s ability to maintain current levels of tuition fees or to potentially increase tuition fees in the future include: - negative perceptions of the quality of its services or a decline in the reputation or official rankings of Multiversity’s academic institutions; - resistance to tuition fee increases by tuition payers due to difficult economic conditions; - lower fees or reductions or discounts of tuition fees by competitors in the markets in which Multiversity operates; and - future government regulation that may impact the tuition fee structure. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 77%[36] of Multiversity’s revenues were generated from tuition fees paid by students offered at its two core institutions, Pegaso and Mercatorum. The inability to maintain or increase tuition fees as a result of these or other factors could have a material and adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, prospects, financial conditions and results of operations. In addition, to stimulate demand, online and traditional competitors might offer discounted tuition fees, which might lead to increased price pressures and sharpened competition within the Italian higher education market. As a result, Multiversity’s profitability might be affected by the risk of rising price pressure. Multiversity’s ability to respond to such pressure would depend on how quickly its institutions could adapt and adjust their tuition fees. Any failure to adequately respond to competitors’ tuition reductions or if potential students do not perceive the quality and value of the services offered by Multiversity’s institutions, and those institutions are unable to compensate for the tuition decreases by attracting more students, Multiversity’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

If Multiversity fails to attract new skilled personnel or faculty or fails to retain and motivate its existing faculty, administrators, and skilled personnel, it may have to withdraw certain programs and may experience a reduction in student enrollment which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations. Additionally, a possible increase in the turnover rate could adversely affect its ability to attract and recruit sufficient staff in key areas which could affect the quality and consistency of the curricula, in turn affecting students’ academic performance as well as the brand and reputation of its educational institutions. In addition, as Multiversity continues to expand and add personnel, it may face additional difficulty in maintaining consistency in the quality of the teaching staff that it recruits.

Similarly, scarce employment opportunities in particular industry sectors might adversely affect the number of students pursuing relevant qualifications. For example, total enrollments across all of Multiversity’s institutions declined by approximately 4% in the 2020/2021 academic year, specifically due to a decrease in enrollments in certain postgraduate and individual courses which are usually undertaken in order to participate in public tenders (concorsi pubblici) for the assignment of public employment posts, such as teaching positions. See “Business— _Enrollment, Student Demographics and Performance by Entity” for further information on enrollment figures for_ the 2020/2021 academic year. Accordingly, should employment opportunities decrease in the Italian job market or, more specifically, should the Italian public administration fail to launch tender procedures periodically or with the expected frequency (usually every two years), or should such tenders require the recruitment of less personnel than expected, demand for Multiversity’s programs and services could decline, thereby materially and adversely affecting Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The online education market has shown constant growth in Italy since the 2015/2016 academic year—see “Industry—The student base is overall resilient over time, with the traditional _segment enrolling the majority of students and the online segment growing taking share from traditional and unlocking additional unmet demand”. In line with this trend, the number of students enrolled in Pegaso and_ Mercatorum’s undergraduate degree courses for the academic year 2020/2021 increased by 49% with respect to the previous academic year. However, the overall number of students enrolled in all courses offered overall by Multiversity slightly decreased (by approximately -4%) compared to the previous academic year, due principally to the seasonality effect linked to public tenders (concorsi pubblici) for specific professions such as teachers— such public tenders are usually carried out every two years by the public administration. Multiversity’s revenues and Adjusted EBITDA were not impacted by the decrease in the total number of enrolled student base due to the increase in undergraduate programmes that have longer duration and higher tuition fee, and in fact grew by 36% and 37%, respectively, in 2020 as compared to 2019. For further information as to the causes underlying the decrease, see “—Demand for Multiversity’s services is affected by employment demand, including by the Italian _public administration” above. In addition, see “Business—Offering” and “Business— Enrollment, Student Demographics and Performance by Entity” for further details on the number of students enrolled in Pegaso and_ Mercatorum. If Multiversity is unable to secure new students through its marketing and recruitment efforts, or fails to expand its educational offering, it may be unable to maintain and/or increase enrollment rates at its universities. A high volume of Pegaso and Mercatorum’s students benefit from preferential rates which are lower than the full-priced tuition fees. Such students, are entitled to preferential rates pursuant to certain agreements that such institutions have entered into with private companies as well as public bodies, in order to provide their employees (and in some cases their related parties) with more favourable rates and thereby incentivizing such employees to, for example, attend courses in order to accelerate their career paths or to comply with the ongoing professional development requirements set up by regulators or employers. Pegaso and Mercatorum together have in place over 1,500 agreements securing captive customers which provide for the application of preferential rates for undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses (see “Business—Tuition Fees—Preferential and corporate _rates”). Should a proportion of such agreements be terminated or not be renewed, Multiversity would be unable_ to offer the same competitive rates to certain categories of students who may choose to enroll at a competitor as a result, thereby impacting Multiversity’s ability to maintain the current enrollment rates at its universities.

A further deduction of interest expense in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of the EBITDA of the company (i.e., risultato operativo lordo della _gestione caratteristica or “ROL”) to be quantified on the basis of the relevant tax values assumed from the_ perspective of the Italian corporate income tax (i.e. considering the tax adjustments applied for corporate income tax purposes to items included in the ROL computed from an accounting perspective). The amount of ROL not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income can be carried forward, increasing the amount of ROL for the following five fiscal years. Interest expense not deducted in a relevant 50 ----- fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years, provided that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income is lower than 30% of ROL. In the case of a tax group, interest expense not deducted by an entity in the tax group due to lack of ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level, within the limit of the excess of ROL of the other companies within the tax group. Based on the above rules, the Issuer (or the Group) may not be able to deduct for Italian tax purposes all interest expenses borne in each relevant fiscal year. In the past, the Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leveraged buyout transactions with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. However, on March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter No. 6/E clarifying, as a common principle, that interest on an acquisition bank loan in leveraged buyout (“LBO”) transactions are generally deductible for the Italian corporate income tax (“IRES”) purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986. In particular, the Italian Revenue Agency confirmed as a general principle that LBO transactions are generally based on sound economic reasons considering that the financing from third party lenders is usually conditional on acquisition of control over the target company by a special purpose vehicle and the following merger with debt push down. As a result of such guidance, LBO transactions are generally not considered irregular for tax purposes absent specific circumstances in which the tax authorities contend that the structuring of any such transaction was designed to obtain unlawful tax advantages in violation of the law or established legal principles (e.g., re-leveraged transactions without a change of control). Any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation, including any future limitation on the use of the ROL of the Issuer and/or the subsidiaries of the Issuer included in the tax group, if any, or the tax treatment of interest expense arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, the failure to satisfy the applicable legal requirements relating to the deductibility of interest expense or the application by Italian tax authorities of certain existing interpretations of Italian tax law may result in our inability to fully deduct our interest expenses, and the application of withholding taxes, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of the Transactions, including the issue of the Notes or the use of proceeds from the Offering, including on the basis of anti-avoidance or anti-abusive criteria, we may be unable to fully deduct our interest expenses or may be subject to (i) significant penalties and accrued interest; (ii) the imposition of withholding taxes or (iii) other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. In the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, refinancing needs, regulatory requirements, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may decide to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons, and we may not be able to secure any such debt or equity financing or refinancing on favorable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could also involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders.

If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Notes Guarantee thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. The claims of secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. On or following the Issue Date, within the time periods specified herein, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis by the Collateral. The Collateral comprises, (i) limited recourse pledge over Paganini’s shares in the Issuer, (ii) limited recourse security interest agreement over Paganini’s structural intercompany receivables owing to it by the Issuer (if any) and (iii) within 20 business days following the Post-Closing Reorganisation, limited recourse pledge over Paganini’s shares in Multiversity.

The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions (including the laws of Italy). If the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, investors in the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or any intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to Multiversity. The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. In addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, due consideration should be given by investors to the circumstance that enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Italy may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. 53 ----- In addition, our business requires a variety of licenses. The continued operation of Multiversity depends on the maintenance of such licenses. Under some of Multiversity’s institutions’ licenses, public authorities impose restrictions on the transfers of the ownership of the license holder, including a change of control clause, which prohibits the transfer of the ownership of the license holder without the prior approval of the authority. In the event of an enforcement action under the terms of the Notes which resulted in the transfer of ownership of the Issuer or its subsidiaries, or a change in the shareholding of the Multiversity for other reasons, the authorities may attempt to cancel our licenses. In addition, the uncertainty concerning the transferability of such licenses themselves could significantly reduce the value placed on the licenses by third parties and ultimately reduce the amount recovered in the event of an enforcement action. The applicable governmental authorities may not consent to the transfer of any of such licenses. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

In addition, the Indenture will not prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain.

Should the Notes Guarantee and/or security interests granted by Target and any of its subsidiaries be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Notes Guarantee and security interests could be declared null and void. In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa.

In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by an Italian Guarantor to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

In addition, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be restricted from providing funds to the Issuer under some circumstances. These circumstances could include, among others, restrictions under Italian corporate law which require a company to retain at least 5% of its annual unconsolidated net income until such reserve reaches at least 20% of the value of the company’s share capital, and future contractual restrictions, including restrictions in credit facilities and other indebtedness, that may affect the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Issuer. In addition, applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to taxation. Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. We cannot assure you that the arrangements with our subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries and our results of operations and cash flow generally will provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes, and we do not expect to have any other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Since the consummation of the Acquisition, the Target Group has been directly wholly owned by the Issuer. As a result, the Sponsor has, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders. The Sponsor’s interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example, the Sponsor could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Moreover, the Sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us and/or that operate in our markets or adjacent ones. The Sponsor may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to or in competition with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, the Sponsor may hold interests in suppliers or customers of the target companies. The Sponsor and its respective affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in changes to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes. Further, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or guarantees which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the application of Italian financial assistance and corporate benefit rules. Accordingly, in such circumstances you would have no direct claim for payment against any such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party with respect to any such additional collateral. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantee or Collateral on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Notes Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent such limitations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor to the extent of such limitations. Future security or guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest. 57 ----- Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims.

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by Italian law.,"The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the security documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including the Republic of Italy. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including the Republic of Italy). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,
625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.6,"Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable as Italian",13.6.1,,"law does not provide for such a construct. All or part of the pledges and other security interests in jurisdictions utilizing the Parallel Debt construct will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Moreover, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interests and guarantees by a _rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf_ of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under 58 ----- the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The Intercreditor Agreement will regulate the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group (as defined below under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Intercreditor Agreement”) that comprises (i) creditors holding more than 66_ [2]⁄3% of the indebtedness and commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, any other Credit Facility and certain priority hedging obligations (the “Super Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and (ii) creditors holding more than 50.0% of the indebtedness under the Notes and indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of security (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representative). If, however, before the discharge of all obligations to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and any other Credit Facility and so long as no insolvency event has occurred, the Security Agent has received conflicting enforcement instructions from the creditor representatives (and for these purposes, the failure to give instructions is deemed to be a conflicting instruction) then, to the extent the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent given) comply with the initial consultation requirements and the security enforcement principles (one of which states that the primary and overriding objective of an enforcement of security over the Collateral is the maximization, so far as is consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of value, of recoveries by the Super Senior Creditors (as defined below under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”), the holders of the Notes and certain creditors ranking pari passu with the holders of the Notes with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of security) each as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will comply with the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if the super senior liabilities have not been fully discharged within six months, or no enforcement action has been taken by the Security Agent within three months, of the date on which the initial consultation period expires (or where no consultation is required, of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors providing a specified notice), or at any time after the occurrence of an insolvency event with respect to certain members of the Multiversity Group, then the instructions of the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. To the extent the Multiversity Group incurs additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of security, your voting interest in an instructing group will be diluted commensurately with the amount of indebtedness the Multiversity Group incurs. The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any Credit Facility and creditors in respect of certain hedging obligations may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer or any of its holding companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action or other distressed disposal in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes against, and the liens over any other assets of, such entities and any subsidiaries of such entity securing the Notes may be released.

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Although we currently intend to hedge the interest rate with respect to the Notes, we may not be able to obtain such hedges, or replace such hedges, on terms that are acceptable to us, and any such hedge may not be fully effective, which would expose us to interest rate risk. 61 ----- Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016.

See “Description of the Notes—Change of _Control.” We may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay these_ amounts when they become due. Our failure to repay holders tendering Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control event would result in an event of default under the Notes.

The Issuer and the Guarantors are not liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes in certain circumstances, including if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as amended or supplemented) (“Decree No. 239”) (except where the procedures required under Decree No. 239 or under Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied with due solely to the actions or omissions by the Issuer or its agents) and any related implementing regulations, or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (as amended or supplemented) (“Decree No. 461”). In those circumstances, investors will receive the proceeds of their investment in the Notes, net of applicable withholding or deductions. In particular, holders of Notes that are not residents in White List countries, holders who are residents in White List countries that do not properly and promptly comply with certain certification and procedural requirements set forth by Decree No. 239 and by the relevant application rules to benefit from exemption from Italian taxation, and certain categories of holders of the Notes who are residents in Italy, will therefore only receive the net proceeds of their investment in the Notes and will not be paid any additional amounts to compensate them for the withholding or deduction. Although we believe that, under current law, Italian substitute tax will not be imposed under Decree No. 239 where the Notes are listed on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility upon issuance and the holder of Notes is a resident for tax purposes in a White List country and such holder promptly and properly complies with certain certification and procedural requirements set forth by Decree No. 239 and by the relevant application rules, there is no assurance that this will be the case should there be a change in applicable law or relevant procedures.

The FCA Announcement and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and Wholesale,13.8.6,Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes.,"The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. Holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations OECD Common Reporting Standards—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax _Considerations”) may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if_ any. See “Certain Tax Considerations OECD Common Reporting Standards—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax _Considerations.”_ Despite the measures taken by countries in the Eurozone to alleviate credit risk, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone member states. These and other concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more member states, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. We cannot assure you that the official exchange rate at which the Notes may be redenominated would accurately reflect their value in euro.

The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the bankruptcy receiver must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any clawback action. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations” for further information._ Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In addition, under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In addition, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. If challenged successfully, the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate.

Although the Issuer will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors and executive officers. In addition, as all the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of its directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Italy. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S. federal securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in Italy. In addition, the enforcement in Italy of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Summary,17.1.1,General,"Multiversity is the market leader in Italy in the e-learning market by number of enrolled students with a 40% market share of the Italian online undergraduate higher education market for the 2019/2020 academic year capturing approximately 3% of the total Italian undergraduate market.[38] It operates two private online universities, Pegaso and Mercatorum, a certification entity, Certipass and a number of academies as well as an international lifelong learning higher education institution based in Malta. It delivers its services through a proprietary online platform that carries out the e-learning contents produced in-house. Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A., held by Multiversity, is the promoter and supporter of Pegaso, Multiversity’s primary education institution. Approximately 105,000 students were enrolled in one of Pegaso’s online courses for the 2020-2021 academic year. Pegaso offers a range of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses, and in particular, seven undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single cycle five-year degree and 139 postgraduate master’s courses as well as a number of higher education and specialization courses for professionals and high school graduates. Pegaso also offers six individual certifications and gives students the possibility to undertake single examinations for each course module upon payment of a fee without having to complete the full course. Multiversity’s other key institution, Mercatorum, is held indirectly by Multiversity through its 66.66% stake in the share capital of Unimercatorum S.r.l. as the promoter and supporter of Mercatorum, with the remaining 33.33% stake in Unimercatorum S.r.l. is held indirectly by Unioncamere. Unioncamere, the Italian Union of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and Agriculture, is the public body that unites and institutionally represents the Italian system of chambers of commerce. Approximately 23,000 students were enrolled in Mercatorum for the 2020-2021 academic year. Mercatorum’s core offering currently consists of 14 undergraduate bachelor’s degrees (two of which are newly accredited and are therefore being offered for the first time in the 2021/2022 academic year), four specialist master’s degrees, one Ph.D. and 11 postgraduate master’s courses. Like Pegaso, it also allows students to undertake single examinations for any course module offered within its curricula. Other assets of Multiversity include Certipass, as provider of international certifications for digital competences and IT skills, and an ever-growing number of academies established through collaboration agreements between Pegaso and Mercatorum and their respective commercial partners, covering a wide range of specialist subjects such as marketing, communications and media and teaching. In addition, Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l. (“Principe",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Multiversity also operates a publishing entity and companies dedicated to research, which are mostly ancillary and in support of the two universities. Almost the entirety of its operations are located in Italy, with some limited operations in Malta. It also has collaboration agreements with several partners in Italy for the development and delivery of specialized courses in a multitude of subjects, made available through its two universities. Multiversity’s revenues for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €188.7 million, as compared to €138.8 million[39] for the prior financial year (an increase of 36%), while Multiversity’s revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were €133.8 million, as compared to €98.1 million in the same period of the prior financial year (an increase of 36%). Undergraduate enrolled students increased by approximately 50% in the 2020/2021 academic year with respect to the previous academic year. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generated for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €102.3 million as compared to €74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (an increase of 37%), while Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was equal to €84.7 million, as compared to €57.4 million in the same period of the prior financial year. Approximately 98% of Multiversity’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated by Pegaso (which accounted for 89% of Multiversity’s revenues) and Mercatorum (which accounted for 9% of Multiversity’s revenues). By comparison, approximately 98% of Multiversity’s revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were generated by Pegaso (which accounted for 81% of Multiversity’s revenues) and Mercatorum (which accounted for 17% of Multiversity’s revenues).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions have been imposed globally leading to shutdowns of non-essential commercial activities with Italy being one of the most affected European countries recording a negative change in GDP in 2020 of 8.9% due to COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the economic downturn triggered by COVID-19 pandemic certain industry sectors remained resilient. The IT and telecommunications grew by 15.3% compared to 2019 due to the establishment of flexible working models, the introduction of online learning in all Italian schools and Italians’ need for leisure activities to cope with the stay-at-home restrictions imposed by the Italian government. In addition, the recent vaccination campaigns in Italy and throughout Europe along with governmental recovery funding are expected to produce macroeconomic results. According to the International Monetary Fund economic forecasts the global economy is expected to grow at 6.0% and 4.9% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. In particular, Italy could benefit from the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility which allocated approximately €46.0 billion to be used in Italy for digitalization, innovation, competitiveness and culture. We believe that these positive economic trends could be favorable for our business model and financial performance.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The increase in the number of new students for the academic year 2019/2020 is mainly recorded with respect to the three-year and master’s degree programmes with approximately 276,000 students, representing 89.2% of total enrolments, representing an increase of approximately 4% over the previous academic year. The increase in new enrolments at Italian universities is driven by a number of factors such as a constant increase in the number of new graduates who continue their education at the Italian universities and also the rapid growth of enrolments registered at online universities. The COVID-19 pandemic also incentivized students to enroll in distance learning programmes which stimulated the new online learning models. The online universities are pioneering this process as they are the key promoters of flexible learning models. We observed favourable market trends in recent years with respect to successful completion of academic studies. In 2009 39.2% of the graduates completed their studies on time whereas in the academic year 2019/2020 the number of such graduates reached 55.7%, with 61.0% having completed two-year master programmes, 56.1% represented first level graduates and 43.5% completed single-cycle masters. In addition, the number of students who did not complete their studies on time also decreased by half over the last decade representing just 8.1% of all students. We observe closely these recent market trends and the increased number of students and the increased demand for online education. We have developed our technological platform and we offer personalizing open-source software able to deliver seamlessly across all platforms and devices so that we can meet the increased demand for online education.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1221,PEGASO[(*)],1221.3,Competitive Strengths,1221.3.1,"Education and training is a large, resilient, underpenetrated market with strong fundamentals, particularly in online segment","Global education and training is a large market, currently valued at over $5.0 trillion[63], and it is expected to grow steadily across the whole spectrum, given significant white space and the need for re-skilling of a significant portion of global population, mainly due to the digital evolution and the new competencies required (“Lifelong Learning”). Online education still represents a relatively small portion overall of the larger global education market, with an estimated global online penetration of 3.6%[64] in 2020. However, the online education segment has and is expected to continue to show strong growth, having outpaced traditional physical education growth in recent years whilst progressively gaining market share and unlocking unaddressed areas of demand. This growth is expected to continue, and in particular subcategories such as higher education, supplemental business–toconsumer (“B2C”) and corporate training are expected to accelerate on the back of COVID-19, which has hastened the adoption of online learning and resulted in an acceleration of online academic offerings. The global education market as a whole has historically grown at a slow but steady pace and has proven resilient[65] through economic cycles, including the financial crisis. Future growth in this market is expected to be supported by several strong structural trends, including: (i) continued student population growth globally and economic expansion; (ii) a growing professional class willing to supplement formal education; (iii) rising levels of participation in education; (iv) the need for employee re-skilling and (v) global investments to further advance education and digitalization. Undergraduate enrollment in Italy has proven resilient over time, displaying a counter cyclical correlation with economic cycles and historically experiencing an increase in enrollments during economic downturns.[66] 63 HolonIQ (Jan 2021). Online penetration defined as education technology digital spend vs. non digital spend 64 HolonIQ (Jan 2021). Online penetration defined as education technology digital spend vs. non digital spend 65 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), source MIUR data, Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis 66 Third Party Commercial Advisor elaboration on MIUR and ISTAT Data. 111 ----- Online universities have been the main contributor to the growth in undergraduate enrollment since they began operating in the Italian market in 2006. More recently, the number of Italian first-timers (new university students who have never been enrolled in university programs) and total students enrolled both maintained their growth[67], in spite of the adverse impact to Italian GDP as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Italy, the overall undergraduate market—encompassing both traditional and online programs—grew steadily at a 1% CAGR[68] over the past four years, reaching a total of 1.8 million students in the 2019-2020 academic year, with enrolment expected to surpass the 2.0 million mark by the 2025-2026 academic year. The primary beneficiary and driver of this growth in the undergraduate population was the online segment, which showcased a 20% annual growth rate between the 2015/2016 and 2019/2020 academic years, while the number of students enrolled in traditional universities has remained substantially flat over the same period. Similar trends are expected to continue, with the online segment anticipated to grow at an annual growth rate of 19% from the 2019/2020 through the 2025/2026 academic years, driving overall market growth even as enrolment at traditional universities is expected to remain flat. A lower percentage of degree holders and a gap in digital skills versus other industrialized peers means that Italy has the potential to benefit disproportionately from these trends as it seeks to close the gap—both in terms of education and digitalization—versus its European peers. Italy stands at 27.7%[69] (vs. 44.9% for OECD) in terms of average population holding a degree and ranks fourth to last versus other developed countries in the DESI digitalization index[70]. The higher education and skills gaps vis-à-vis populations in peer nations represent a significant growth opportunity for online education in Italy, and in particular those programs specializing in digital skills training. Due to its aging workforce, Italy is also expected to require a large number of graduates across multiple disciplines in the next five years, totalling nearly 900,000 in expected new hires according to Unioncamere[71]. Specifically with respect to the disciplines in which Multiversity focuses, the expected need over this period is for approximately 120,000 graduates in Economics & Business Administration, 120,000 in Engineering, 105,000 in Teaching and Training and 90,000 in Law. 67 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), 68 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis on MIUR data for historicals, forecasts based on Third Party Commercial Advisor estimates 69 Percentage of population between 25 and 34 with university education in 2018 70 Weighed digitalization score (DESI report) 71 Unioncamere report 2021 “Previsioni dei Fabbisogni Occupazionali e Professionali in Italia a medio termine” 112 ----- _Demand for graduates in the Italian job market_ The postgraduate market has grown even faster than the undergraduate market, experiencing a CAGR of 17% from the 2015/2016 to the 2019/2020 academic years and reaching 96,000 students in the 2019/2020 academic year. Over the same period, growth in online postgraduate enrollment, which already exceeds that of traditional channels, was a CAGR of 30%. Postgraduate growth is expected to continue at a double-digit CAGR through the 2025/2026 academic year, driven primarily by the continued increase in the adoption of online education. In addition to these secular long-term trends, growth in the online undergraduate and postgraduate education markets, which comprise the Multiversity Group’s core addressable markets, has been buoyed by recent shortterm catalysts, including the COVID-19 pandemic which accelerated adoption of online channels, as well as improving sentiment regarding online universities among prospective students. COVID-19 has boosted overall internet penetration to levels significantly exceeding pre-crisis (e-commerce, e-health, e-learning), also including the demand for online education. This has resulted in a pronounced short-term spike in expected growth which, over the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 academic years, is expected to be more than double the annualized growth rate expected from 2022/2023 to 2025/2026 (projected 28% over 2020/2021-2021/2022 academic years as compared to 14% over 2022/2023-2025/2026 academic years, annual growth rates for the Italian online undergraduate enrolled base). Students’ improving perception of online universities has been a key factor in recent growth, as illustrated by the 83% of students[72] currently enrolled in online universities who think that the quality of teaching they receive is on par, if not better, than that of traditional universities. This favorable impression is also validated by employability statistics that put online universities slightly above mid-sized physical universities among top employers selecting applicants[73] (over a period of 12 months, 8.6% of students from online universities went to one of the top 50 employers in Italy, vs. 8.5% for mid-sized universities). A rising proportion of Italian high school students is expected to be interested in attending an online university, on the back of increasing perceived strength of their online education offerings. The proportion of first-timers (new university students coming from high school who have never enrolled in university) is expected to increase to 47% of new students in the 2025/2026[74] academic year as compared to 39% today in 2019/2020 and 33% in 2015/2016. Students are attracted to a model that they feel better suits their needs thanks to inherent flexibility, more friendly study experience and better support, alongside lower costs (especially when considering costs ancillary to education such as accommodation and travel). 72 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), source survey @ January 2021, percentage of students enrolled in online universities (n=800) “From a teaching and learning perspective, how do you consider online universities versus the following panel of traditional universities?” 73 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), source Linkedin Recruiter (January 2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis. 74 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis 113 ----- _Structural tailwinds_ The education market has demonstrated steady and resilient growth on the back of various structural tailwinds: - **Historical population growth and economic expansion: increasing population globally and economic growth will naturally expand the addressable market with an increasing number of people willing to get a formal education; - **Emerging middle class willing to supplement formal education: the middle class in particular sees education as an enabler of personal growth and wealth, thus making it likely to supplement formal, basic education with additional courses; - **Rising levels of participation in education: overall participation in education is rising, reflecting a need for skilled workforce globally due to trends in industrialization and modernization that have automated many of the processes that previously employed unskilled workers; - **“Lifelong learning”: even a skilled and educated labor force is likely to require additional skills training due to the speed of digital evolution and the implied new competencies required. Recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these programs have largely been restricted to online channels; - **Government investments to increase levels of education: recognizing higher education as an indicator of citizens’ wealth, governments globally are investing in increased access to education in an effort to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (“SDG”) 2030 Agenda: (i) ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all and (ii) promoting continuous, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Online education also benefits from the specific tailwinds inherent to a delivery model that provides access to people that could not otherwise participate full time or afford to attend a traditional, physical university. Onlinespecific tailwinds in education include: - **Increasing online penetration reaching new potential students: online education unlocks an addressable market by reaching previously underrepresented parts of the population, either due to economic or logistical reasons; - **Government investments in digitalization: focus on digitalization efforts with dedicated funds (i.e. €49.2 billion for Italy alone in the latest European Recovery Fund focused on digitalization of public administration and of the industrial sector[75]); - **Younger generations’ desire for higher education: new generations value both quality education and flexible career paths, which online universities offer, thanks a better-suited consumption model, especially for part-time students; - **Lower overall costs: not requiring costs for attending physical lessons (e.g. housing, transport, cost of living), online education is generally more affordable than traditional one and accordingly appeals to a growing share of the population that desires an education but could not otherwise afford to attend a traditional university; - **Tapping unmet demand: online education offers to people who historically have not been able to obtain a university degree, or are currently working, programs addressing their demand for a more flexible path to a degree; - **Highly Scalable Supply: constrained by the practical limits of in-person education, traditional universities will struggle to meet increasing demand for graduates globally, while online universities’ business model is highly scalable and can increase capacity as needed, leveraging existing platform without additional required large investments in infrastructures. _Current sentiment for online universities_ A market study conducted by a third-party commercial advisor (the “Third Party Commercial Advisor”)[76] highlighted an overall very positive market sentiment towards online universities, which it found were considered highly comparable to traditional ones from a teaching perspective.

The study also illustrates how the online education platform offered by online universities is perceived of higher quality due to its “native” nature vs. online/ hybrid education models offered by traditional channels. Employability of online university graduates is on average in line with the levels registered in mid-size or largesize traditional universities: among graduates who switched jobs in the 12 months between January 2020 and January 2021, 8.6% were hired full time by the top 50 Italian employers[78] from online universities, compared to 8.5% for graduates from mid-sized traditional universities and 9.5% for graduates from large-sized traditional universities in the same time frame.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Deferred tax liabilities are entered in the ‘Provision for deferred taxes’, recorded under liabilities among the provisions for risks and charges, while the deferred tax assets are recorded within the receivables from others under current assets. Deferred tax assets are not recognised, in compliance with the prudence principle, if there is not reasonable certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be reversed, of a taxable income higher than the amount of the differences that will be cancelled. Liabilities for deferred taxes are recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will reverse in the foreseeable future.

The increase was primarily driven by 82 ----- the increase in revenues from sales and services attributable to an increase in the tuition and other fees together with the increase in the number of new students enrolled in degree courses. Value of production also includes other revenues and income which decreased by €1.7 million, or 67.1%, from €2.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to €0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ordinary windfall profits made by Pegaso and other companies of Multiversity Group since the six-months ended June 30, 2020 included the release of provisions for risks and charges accrued in previous years, which was partially offset by an increase in operating grants. _Costs for services_ Costs for services increased by €5.8 million, or 19.0%, from €30.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to €36.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was the result of the growth of the business that occurred in the first half of the current year (mainly ELCPs, promotional activities carried out by the universities of the Group, bank charges and teachers’ fees) which was partially offset by operational efficiencies such as utilities savings that are mostly due to the smart working activities that occurred in 2021. The percentage incidence of costs for services to the value of production decreased from 31% in the first half of 2020 to 27% in the first half of 2021, since the above described increases were less than proportionally compared to the increase the value of production, as well as the utilities savings. _Costs for use of third party assets_ Cost for use of third party assets of Multiversity Group increased by €0.1 million, or 4.6%, from €2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to €2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily as a result of: (i) the rent of new office spaces for Pegaso in the Naples headquarter in connection with the development of the business; (ii) the relocation of some Mercatorum offices, in Rome, and (iii) opening some new Pegaso sites in Rome. Cost of personnel Personnel costs increased by €2.2 million, or 36.9%, from €5.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to €8.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

The increase was driven by higher current income taxes of €9.4 million due to a higher taxable base as a result of the expansion of the business, whose effect is partially offset by the release of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the exercise of the option to realign since January 1, 2021 the fiscal and accounting value of intangibles pursuant to art. 110 of the Italian Legislative Decree dated August 14, 2020.

The increase was primarily attributable to revenue derived from the educational offerings of the Universities of the Multiversity Group, in particular Pegaso and Mercatorum, as well as the certification company, Certipass (historically controlled at 50% and included in the consolidated financial statements using the proportional method). Pegaso is the largest single contributor to Multiversity’s results and accounted for 89% of Multiversity’s revenues and 86% of Multiversity’s Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended December 31, 2020. Mercatorum accounted for 9% of Multiversity’s revenues and 6% of Multiversity’s Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by sustained undergraduate growth, which contribute a higher revenue per student (higher tuition-fee and ancillary services linked to them) and student duration, which completely offset the lower volumes in postgraduate linked to the seasonality of FIT (specific type of master’s). _Pegaso_ With regard to degree courses, during 2020, (i) Pegaso experienced a significant increase in the number of enrolments, and (ii) two new degree courses were accredited during the year, which have been well received by new students. The degree course with the highest growth in 2020 is the Sport Management and Sport Sciences course, which ranks fourth among the degree courses with the highest number of new students in Italy, with an increase in the number of students of 81.4% compared to the previous year. The Safety Engineering and Educational Sciences courses performed in line with the trends of Italian students and the degree courses in engineering and teaching were among the most popular in Italian universities. _Mercatorum_ As for Mercatorum, the university recorded a strong increase in revenues due to: (i) the training offer which was significantly expanded in 2020 with the addition of 5 new study courses (3 three-year and 2 master’s); (ii) strong growth in enrolled students, showing a CAGR in excess of 100% between the academic year 2019/2020 and the academic year 2020/2021. The Professional Criminologist Advanced Training Course, is the most popular due to the highly topical nature of the subject (it also allows enrollment in the second year of the Legal Sciences Degree course). Moreover, the Higher Education and Specialization Courses constitute a significant growth asset for the University, becoming a strategic tool for building student loyalty.

The evolution of the student base highlights a fast-growing trend in the undergraduate degree offering, which represents the largest contributor to revenue given the higher tuition fee and duration of the students’ academic career (undergraduate degrees tend to have a duration spanning from three to five years, while postgraduate courses and individual courses mostly last one year), whilst showing a decline in enrollments in postgraduate individual courses. The 85 ----- latter is due to the seasonality effect linked to public tenders (“concorsi pubblici”) for specific professions such as teachers. Such public tenders are usually carried out every two years by the public administration and therefore the decrease in enrollments for the 2020/2021 academic year is expected to be recovered once the tenders are announced once again in the coming year. Such expected recovery will be further positively affected by the expected increase in hirings in the public education sector in Italy. Value of production include other revenues and income of Multiversity Group decreased by €0.1 million, or 5.1%, from €2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and were primarily associated with a reduction in contributions related to university research projects which was largely offset by the release of provisions for risks and charges, as a result of the fact that the risk for which the provision was made in previous years no longer exists, and other contingent assets. _Costs for services_ Cost of services of Multiversity Group increased by €19.6 million, or 43.1%, from €45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €65.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly includes costs for contributions relating to university guidance centres for an amount of approximately €23.6 million, costs incurred for promotional activities for an amount equal to approximately €26.8 million, fees to the corporate bodies and the academic evaluation team equal to roughly €1.37 million, technical, legal and administrative consultancy for an amount of approximately €845 thousand, insurance and bank charges amounting to around €1.13 million and other services connected with the operational management of the various Group companies. Regarding costs for services, Pegaso accounts for 86% and Mercatorum for 9%. The increase was primarily driven by higher costs incurred for promotional activities to support the Multiversity Group’s brands to drive further growth (which increase by more than 100% in both Pegaso and Mercatorum) and higher contributions paid to ELCPs in connection with the increase in the University’s activities (which increased by more than 100% in Mercatorum, while showing an increase of approximately 5% in Pegaso). _Costs for use of third party assets_ Costs for use of third party assets of Multiversity Group decreased by €0.6 million, or 11.7%, from €5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to rental costs for the numerous offices of the universities of the Multiversity Group, which amounted to approximately €3.2 million, while the remainder was mainly attributable to the rental of cars and other equipment necessary for the performance of the operating activities of the companies of the Group. _Cost of personnel_ Personnel costs of Multiversity Group increased by €4.4 million, or 47.5%, from €9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in the educational and administrative staff employed, as a result of revenue growth. The year 2020 was characterised by the consolidation of relations with the new shareholder represented by the CVC Capital Partners private equity fund and by the completion of the corporate reorganisation already launched in the previous year, to allow entry and integration into the capital of the Multiversity of the new financial partner. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses of Multiversity Group increased by €4.8 million, from €3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was largely a result of a subsidiary Pegaso agreeing in March 2020 to a settlement with certain ELCPs, which provided for the consensual termination of the agreements in place effective from January 1, 2020, based on the payment of a total amount of €4.0 million, in the form of compensation, and a total consideration of approximately €16.6 thousand per month, plus VAT, for the entire five-year duration of a series of obligations undertaken by the relevant ELCPs, including the obligation of not undertaking activities in competition with those of the university. The transaction was entered into on the basis of the decision to bring in-house the main activities carried out by these ELCPs. This transaction was part of the reorganisation of the Multiversity Group’s structure aiming to optimise internal processes. 86 ----- _Amortization, depreciation and write-downs_",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of the Group’s intangible fixed assets amounting to €35.3 million, which includes the amortisation of goodwill, calculated over an estimated useful life of 20 years and amounting to €28.5 million. The remainder mainly includes the amortisation of trademarks, platforms and rights owned by Multiversity S.r.l. and in use by the Multiversity Group’s universities. The costs related to the write-down of receivables from students increased by €1.7 million, or 39.7%, from €4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the increase in trade receivables due to the higher student base. _EBITDA_ EBITDA of Multiversity Group increased by €21.2 million, or 30.2%, from €70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenues. The decline in EBITDA margin from 51% to 48% is due to the non- recurring effects of the period. The Adjusted EBITDA margin remains constant at 54%. For the reconciliation of EBITDA to our financial statements see Presentation of Financial and Other _Information.

Such increase is led by the increase in the value of production by 22%, whose effect was partially offset by the reduction in other revenues and income by 92% due to the positive not recurring effect of a provision release in profit and loss 2018. During 2019, Pegaso saw a further increase in the number of students enrolled in the various degree courses. This increase, equal to over 13% for degree courses, confirms the validity of the strategic path undertaken, aimed at further educational and academic growth. Pegaso has always invested and continues to invest its educational and financial resources in postgraduate and post-diploma training offerings, always focusing on highly specialised courses suitable for a constantly evolving job market.

The increase in income taxes is due to the different tax regime applicable to the University following the conversion into a joint stock company whose object is, for IRES purposes, the entire institutional activity of the period from June 25, 2019 to December 31, 2019 being subject to business income tax and, for IRAP purposes, the transition from the “remuneration” method of calculation pursuant to art. 10 of Italian Legislative Decree no.446/1997 to the method applicable to joint stock companies pursuant to art. 5 of Italian Legislative Decree no.446/1997.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The increase is the result of higher profit for the period (a profit of €47.5 million and €17.4 million in the period ended June 30, 2021 and 90 ----- 2020, respectively), which has been adjusted for non-cash expenses and income, namely (i) income taxes (€15.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021; €14.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020); (ii) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets (€18.1 million for six months ended June 30, 2021; €18.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020); (iii) write-downs of current receivables (€3.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021; €2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020) that were made by estimating the amounts of credits accrued for which there is a risk of recoverability. Such effects were partially offset by an increase in net working capital due to: (i) a decrease in trade receivables as a result of the universities students payments tranche scheduling; (ii) a decrease in the negative balance of other current assets and liabilities, mainly as a result of the reduction of accrued liabilities and deferred income due to the turnover growth. _Investing activities_ Total cash flow from investing activities decreased by €3.4 million, from €4.3 million outflow for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to €0.9 million outflow for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The change is mainly due to a decrease in intangible assets (€0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021; €2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020) and in financial fixed assets (€0.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021; €2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020), due to the acquisition in 2020 of other securities that includes asset management for an amount equal to €2.0 million on deposit with a leading Italian bank. _Financing activities_ Total cash flow from financing activities decreased by €0.1 thousand, from €0.2 thousand outflow for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to €0.1 thousand outflow for the six months ended June 30, 2021.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

In the absence of indicators of potential impairment, the recoverable value is not determined. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and its value in use determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows. An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value. When, subsequently, a loss on assets, other than goodwill, ceases or is reduced, the book value of the asset or the cash-generating unit is increased up to the new estimate of the recoverable value without exceeding the value that would have been determined if no loss had been detected.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,
625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1222,U������������,1222.81,Critical Accounting Policies,1222.81.2,Receivables,"Receivables originating from revenues for the sale of goods or the provision of services are recognised under current assets on the basis of the accrual principle when the conditions for the recognition of the related revenues are met. The revenue recognition policy is set out below. Most of the revenues are deferred on the basis of the academic year which starts on August 1 and ends on July 31 of the following year, calculating the actual days. Revenues deriving from “OLD” students (students already enrolled in the previous year) are accounted for at the beginning of the new academic year (August 1) and deferred for the entire period (until July 31). Revenues deriving from “NEW” students (new students enrolled) are accounted for at the time of registration to the university, which can take place at any time during the academic year, and are deferred for the remaining period (until July 31, end of the academic year). FIT revenues are not deferred on the basis of the academic years but according to the following percentages: 50% / 25% / 25% respectively in the accounting month and in the following 2 months. The other types of revenue are directly accounted for in the billing month and therefore are not deferred (as for EIPASS revenues). Receivables originating for different reasons are recognised if there is a ‘title’ to the receivable and therefore when they actually represent a third-party obligation to the company; if of a financial nature they are classified under financial fixed assets, with an indication of the portion due within the next fiscal year. Receivables are valued in the financial statements at amortized cost, taking into account the time factor, and within the limits of their presumed realisable value and, therefore, are shown in the balance sheet net of the related bad debt provision deemed adequate to cover losses due to reasonably foreseeable non-collectability. If the interest rate of the transaction is not significantly different from the market rate, the receivable is initially recorded at a value equal to the nominal value net of all premiums, discounts, rebates and inclusive of any costs directly attributable to the transaction, which generated the receivable. These transaction costs, any commission income and expense and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are spread over the duration of the loan using the effective interest criterion. On the other hand, when the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly different from the market rate, the receivable (and the corresponding revenue in the case of commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows plus any transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate. In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value of the receivable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as financial income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate criterion. 98 ----- In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest income accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with the value of the receivable as a contra entry. The value of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the amounts received, both by way of principal and interest, as well as for any write-downs to bring the receivables back to their presumed realisable value or for losses. The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortized cost and the discounting back are not relevant when the maturity of the receivables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and substantial considerations in place on recognition of the receivable, and the transaction costs and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity is of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting was omitted, the interest was calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs were entered among deferrals and amortized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the receivable to adjust the nominal interest income.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Contingent liabilities are recognised in the financial statements and booked under provisions when they are likely to materialise and when the amount of the related charge can be reasonably estimated.

Deferred taxes are entered in the ‘Provision for deferred taxes’, recorded under liabilities among the provisions for risks and charges, while the prepaid taxes are recorded in the receivables from others under current assets. Assets deriving from prepaid taxes are not recognised, in compliance with the prudence principle, if there is no reasonable certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be reversed, of a taxable income higher than the amount of the differences that will be cancelled. Liabilities for deferred taxes are recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year in which the tax asset will be realised or the tax liability will be settled, based on the tax legislation established by the provisions in force at the reporting date.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

In Italy there are 68 public universities mostly located in major urban areas. These do not have admission tests, with the exception of specific courses (such as medicine and architecture) and have annual tuition in the range of approximately €350—€3,000 per annum, depending on students’ wealth. There are 19 private traditional universities, with higher average tuition fees (approximately €3,000—€15,000) and mostly with some sort of admission test or criteria based on the students’ academic performance in high school. Online universities, which are solely private, represent a smaller segment of 11 universities, with no admission test (also driven by the fact that there are no limitations associated with physical space availability) and with average annual tuition between approximately €750—€5,000. The Italian university market, initially closed to online universities, was officially opened to online competition in 2003 (but only started operating in 2006). On April 17, 2003, the Italian University Education and Research Ministry, together with the Minister for Innovation and Technology, opened the higher education market to online universities with courses delivered for the first time in 2006, in an effort to increase the number of people holding a higher education degree and offer a more flexible path to students. Since the opening of the online Italian higher education market in 2003, 11 online private universities were established (including Pegaso and Mercatorum) and today they enroll approximately 190,000 students (academic year 2019/2020)[43]. There are no public online universities and the online university market is structurally closed to new entrants, as no further licenses are currently expected to be issued. In particular, the ban for the establishment of online universities in Italy is usually extended every three years, with the publication of the Ministerial Decree governing Italian universities’ academic planning. The latest Ministerial Decree published in March 2021 (Decree n. 289 of 25 March 2021) confirmed the ban until 2023.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,
625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,"Despite improvements in the recent years, Italy still remains the developed country with the lowest tertiary education penetration and a considerably high drop-out rate, coupled with one of the lowest online penetrations in Europe",18.2.1,,"Despite improvements in the recent years, Italy still remains the developed country with the lowest tertiary education penetration among its population aged 25-34 years old (27.7% in 2019) with significant gaps compared to the OECD average of 44.9% and some of the most penetrated countries worldwide (UK of 51.8%, US of 50.4%, France of 48.1%, and Spain of 46.5%)[44]. The Italian higher education market is quite different when compared to other European markets. Aside for the low graduate penetration, Italy also has a considerably high drop-out rate for upper secondary and tertiary education and training with a sizeable gap compared with the EU average. The Italian market, while improving its drop-out rate in the past ten years, still displayed an approximately 13% drop-out rate in 2020 (of the population aged 18-24 leaving early from their education), when compared to the approximately 10% EU average and the goal to reach 9% at European level in 2030. When focusing on Italian tertiary education courses, the highest drop-out rate is displayed among Bachelor’s degrees, with a 12.2% drop-out rate for the 2015/2016 cohort (in the first year) according to the National Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research 43 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis on MIUR data 44 OECD (2021), Population aged 25-34 year-olds with tertiary education as of 2019. 100 ----- Institutes[45], followed by 5-year Master’s degrees at 7.5% and, finally, Master’s of Science with 5.9% (vs. 16.3%, 10.0%, and 7.7% respectively in 2007). This is also due to structural factors, including a relatively wide territory with peripheral areas distant from urban centres and therefore rendering university attendance more expensive (due to travel and accommodation costs) as well as complicated for those students working at the same time. _Early leavers from education and training, 2010 and 2020[46 47] Population aged 18-24, early leavers from education and training in 2020_",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Aside for the high drop-out rate, Italy has one of the lowest online penetrations in Europe and lacks robust infrastructure to support critical digital developments in various sectors. The lack of sufficient digital coverage has historically represented a major obstacle to the adoption of online education, especially for rural areas, where access to traditional universities is often limited by logistical (long distance from university centres) and financial (more expensive due to travel and accommodation costs) complexities. Furthermore, the career path for a student in Italy tends to be longer and less flexible than those of many other EU countries, due to a focus on theoretical subjects (for which exams take a longer time to prepare for, given their theoretical nature), a large proportion of Italian universities only offering single exam dates per year (i.e. only one chance per year) and a higher population living in peripheral or non-urban areas. _Bachelor degree_ **12.2%** _5-Yr Master_ **7.5%** _Master of Science_ **5.9%** -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The population increased by approximately 130,000 students between academic year 2015/2016 and academic year 2019/2020, but while over these years the traditional university channel has remained substantially flat in terms of enrolled students, the online one has materially increased its relevance and accounted for the vast majority of the aforementioned growth. Today students enrolled in online universities represent approximately 10% of the total market, a significant improvement since academic year 2015/2016 when it accounted for approximately 5% only. Among the existing 11 online universities, a handful of players captured approximately 90%[49] and the top two approximately 76% of the postgraduate students enrolled, respectively (academic year 2019/2020) and these players drove the vast majority of the above mentioned growth in the past years. Multiversity Group, owning the fastest growing players Pegaso and Mercatorum, is the market leader and has contributed alone to over 55% of the growth of the online market since academic year 2015/2016 and it is expected to continue to be the main contributor and beneficiary of the market future evolution. 45 National Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes (2018), Biennial report on the state of the university system and research, processing of national student registry data. 46 Eurostat (June 2021), Early leavers from education (incl. upper secondary education and tertiary education) and training, 2010 and 2020, % of population aged 18-24. 47 Drop-out rate between the first and second year of studies, by type of course, for academic year of 2015/2016; Source: National Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes (2018). 48 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis on MIUR data for historicals, forecasts based on Third Party Commercial Advisor estimates 49 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), Source MIUR data (extraction @6/2019) and Pegaso internal data; Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis 101",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The Italian population enrolled in the undergraduate market, currently representing 95%[50] of the total higher education base, has grown in the past 5 years at a 1% annual rate and reached 1.8 million students in academic year 2019/2020, with online universities growing at 20% per annum over the same timeframe. This trend is also expected to continue in the future and, on the back of an expected 19% annual growth rate for online universities, the total number of undergraduate students is expected to exceed 2.0 million by academic year 2025/2026. Online universities significantly increased their relevance in the market, representing 7.7% of the total undergraduate population with approximately 135,000 enrolled students in academic year 2019/2020, a significant improvement from 3.9% in academic year 2015/2016 and even more remarkable when considering that this channel did not exist prior to 2006. On the back of favorable tailwinds, online penetration is expected to further accelerate reaching 18.7% of the total market by academic year 2025/2026, adding over 240,000 online students to current levels and reaching a total of approximately 379,000 students. COVID-19 serves as an accelerator of growth, helping overcome potential scepticism around validity and efficacy of online education and this is reflected in the strong market growth expected over the next two academic years (28% and 29% in academic year 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 respectively). The new investments in digitalization aimed at covering the significant white spaces across the country represent a further accelerator to reach an additional portion of the population whose needs are currently unaddressed.

Attractiveness of online universities is further sustained by the fact that first timers will be the main driver of growth (47% of new additions in academic year 2025/2026—according to forecasts). Increasing relevance of first-timers will be positive for online universities as it will enhance revenue stability due to longer duration of the student’s term. With opposite effect to the student base, drop-outs in online universities have historically been a high single-digit percentage[6] (between 6% and 7% churn on average in the past 5 academic years) of the total enrolled student base at the beginning of the year, a figure which is expected to stabilize around 6% going forward (the level reached in academic year 2019/2020).

The Italian population enrolled in the postgraduate master’s segment, currently representing 5%[54] of the total higher education market, has displayed a stronger historical growth than the undergraduate market, increasing from 52,000 students in academic year 2015/2016 to 96,000 in academic year 2019/2020, representing a 17% annual growth rate. Online universities experienced a remarkable 39% annual growth rate in their student population, over six times faster than traditional universities (whose annual growth rate stood at 6%). The total number of students in the postgraduate master’s market is expected to continue to grow at double digit annual growth rate, more than doubling from current levels, reaching 195,000 students by academic year 2025/2026. Online universities currently attract more students than traditional ones; online penetration in the academic year 2019/2020 stood at 57% of the total population (vs. approximately 36% in academic year 2015/2016). This penetration of online universities is expected to further grow, reaching 66% in academic year 2025/2026. By then, 128,000 master’s students are expected to be enrolled in online universities, a pool of students larger than the current total for the postgraduate master’s market. Multiversity is set to benefit from this postgraduate master’s market growth. Focusing on that segment in particular has seen strong growth and this trend is expected to continue. Quality of the education offering and flexibility of the business model (especially for workers) are the main reasons for choosing Multiversity’s master’s programs. In addition, Multiversity, through its two universities, is able to offer contents which are aligned with the Italian job market’s needs. _Postgraduate master students’ evolution (thousands of students)[55]_ 54 Third Party Commercial Advisor, commercial due diligence (2021), Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis on MIUR data for historicals, forecasts based on Third Party Commercial Advisor estimates 55 Source: Third Party Commercial Advisor analysis. Note: Postgraduate education includes 1 year Masters courses mainly for workers who already have at least a Bachelor degree, and single courses mainly for workers who have a high school or university degree, and who are pursuing learning improvements (voluntary of required by regulators or employers) 104 ----- _Postgraduate courses_ Multiversity also derives a high percentage of its postgraduate revenues from single courses (FIT + FORM + Single Courses) which are highly connected with public administration hiring trends through “Concorso Pubblico” (i.e. public hiring tenders that require a specific exam). These hiring trends were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing public tenders by 60/70%[56] compared to previous years, but a rebound is expected as these tend to be recurring hiring tenders over the years. Until 2025, Unioncamere expects the need to hire 740,000 new employees in the public administration either to replace workers who are retiring (93% of total) or for new positions (7% of total). Hires are expected to remain below historical averages for 2021 (approximately 30-50 thousand new employees) given the pandemic, but a significant bounce back is expected from 2022, with Multiversity set to positively benefit from this due to its market position. Total employment in the public administration has overall been flat in the last five years (approximately 3.2m employees), with yearly hires showing, historically, a fluctuating trend, with an average inflow of approximately 70,000 units per annum (excluding healthcare hires, mainly out of Pegaso FORM, FIT and Single Courses offering). In the medium term, the number of hires from the public administration is estimated to bounce back from 2022 (highest inflow, at approximately 90,000—110,000) until 2025 (approximately 65,000—85,000) driven by: (i) approximately 70,000 baseline hires to re-align to historical trends for total public administration employees, with a larger impact in the initial years as the market “recovers from the lost ground” (approximately 60,000—90.000 less employments) created by “Concorsi Pubblici” postponements in 2020-21; and (ii) a substantial boost to the economy and, subsequently, hiring levels through the Recovery Fund. Multiversity, deriving the majority of its postgraduate revenues from these single courses, is perfectly positioned to benefit from the re-acceleration of “Concorsi Pubblici” from 2022 onwards. _Public Administration hiring evolution: Pegaso main perimeter (2014-2025 | thousands of hirings)[57]_ 107",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

It delivers its services through a proprietary online platform that carries out the e-learning contents produced in-house. Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A., held by Multiversity, is the promoter and supporter of Pegaso, Multiversity’s primary education institution. Approximately 105,000 students were enrolled in one of Pegaso’s online courses for the 2020-2021 academic year. Pegaso offers a range of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses, and in particular, seven undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, five specialist master’s degrees, one single cycle five-year degree and 139 postgraduate master’s courses as well as a number of higher education and specialization courses for professionals and high school graduates. Pegaso also offers six individual certifications and gives students the possibility to undertake single examinations for each course module upon payment of a fee without having to complete the full course. Multiversity’s other key institution, Mercatorum, is held indirectly by Multiversity through its 66.66% stake in the share capital of Unimercatorum S.r.l. as the promoter and supporter of Mercatorum, with the remaining 33.33% stake in Unimercatorum S.r.l. is held indirectly by Unioncamere. Unioncamere, the Italian Union of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and Agriculture, is the public body that unites and institutionally represents the Italian system of chambers of commerce. Approximately 23,000 students were enrolled in Mercatorum for the 2020-2021 academic year. Mercatorum’s core offering currently consists of 14 undergraduate bachelor’s degrees (two of which are newly accredited and are therefore being offered for the first time in the 2021/2022 academic year), four specialist master’s degrees, one Ph.D. and 11 postgraduate master’s courses. Like Pegaso, it also allows students to undertake single examinations for any course module offered within its curricula. Other assets of Multiversity include Certipass, as provider of international certifications for digital competences and IT skills, and an ever-growing number of academies established through collaboration agreements between Pegaso and Mercatorum and their respective commercial partners, covering a wide range of specialist subjects such as marketing, communications and media and teaching.

Apart from the Postgraduate School in Legal Professions (as further described below), Principe di Napoli is one of the few institution within Multiversity to hold on premise courses. Multiversity also operates a publishing entity and companies dedicated to research, which are mostly ancillary and in support of the two universities. Almost the entirety of its operations are located in Italy, with some limited operations in Malta. It also has collaboration agreements with several partners in Italy for the development and delivery of specialized courses in a multitude of subjects, made available through its two universities.

To acquire the relevant authorisation, online universities shall: - implement a flexible organisational structure allowing the use of different technologies to properly manage different activities; - promote a consistent and teaching-tailored integration of teaching support services; - ensure the selection, planning and design of adequate e-learning resources for each coursework; - ensure adequate resources exist for the administration and management of disseminating teaching resources, including through the offer of articulate tailored teletutoring service; and - ensure adequate procedures for knowledge assessment; provide for research and development of innovative e-learning systems capable of supporting the dissemination of multimedia data linked to the range of learning products offered. 151 ----- Since 2004, 11 online universities have been established and obtained the relevant authorisation (“accreditamento”) with the MIUR, before a ban was imposed on the establishment of new online universities (most recently pursuant to Decree 289, which extended the ban to the period 2021-2023). On October 14, 2021, the new Ministerial Decree regarding the self-evaluation, evaluation, initial and periodic accreditation of study centers and courses (“DM 2021”) issued by the MIUR was registered in the official Register of Decrees. Such decree, among other things and in line with industry guidelines, updates the criteria for the allocation of academic staff by degree program. The operational aspects and terms of implementation of DM 2021 will be defined by means of a special Decree - as yet unissued. Once in force, when published in the Italian official gazette, DM 2021 will replace Decree 6 as of the 2022/2023 academic year. All (traditional and online) universities will have approximately five years from the 2020/2021 academic year to gradually implement the new measures. The impact of DM 2021 on the Group’s operations and financial performance will be determined once the final operational aspects and terms will be defined, and will lead to a progressive increase of the teaching cost base over 5 years and eventually may lead to improving the quality and reputation of the academics in the sector. See further “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Business and Industry—Any termination, suspension, _revocation or non-renewal of any of Multiversity’s licenses and authorisations could result in the temporary or permanent cessation of the activities being conducted pursuant to such license and/or authorisation, impact its ability to enroll new students, adversely affect Multiversity’s reputation or cause it to incur unanticipated costs. Any of the circumstances described above are likely to have a material adverse effect on Multiversity’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Regulatory changes and investigations may be driven by political and public opinion affecting providers of higher education.” Courses that can be provided by online universities_ Pursuant to Decree 289, online universities are allowed to provide: - distance learning courses, where over two thirds of the educational activities are delivered at a distance; and - distance learning courses provided entirely at distance, where all the educational activities are delivered at a distance, save for exams and discussions relating to final tests, which are taken in person. Online universities cannot therefore setup classes for courses for which only a mixed mode of delivery is envisaged (i.e. when distance learning does not exceed two thirds of all educational activities) and cannot set up courses in the Medicine, Dentistry and Health Professions. However, online universities are allowed to offer courses in a mixed mode of delivery by pairing with traditional universities or highly specialised research laboratories[121]. _Academic degrees that can be granted by online universities_ Pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 2 of the “Moratti-Stanca” Decree, online universities can issue the following academic diplomas and decrees as prescribed by Article 3 of the MIUR Decree No. 270 of 22 October 2004: - Degree (“Laurea”); - Master’s Degree (as defined by Ministerial Decree 270/2004, which updated the Ministerial Decree No. 509 of 3 November 1999) (“Laurea specialistica”); - Specialization Diploma (“Diploma di specializzazione”); - Ph.D. (“Dottorato di ricerca”); and - first-and second-level master study programmes. In addition, online universities can confer 24 CFUs and other qualifying titles. However, online universities cannot: - grant academic degrees in courses relating to health professions; or - establish professionally oriented degree courses[122] as defined in Article 8, paragraph 2 of Ministerial Decree No. 987 of 12 December 2016 and in Ministerial Decree No. 446 of 12 August 2020. 121 Source: CUN opinion dated 28 September 2016 (https://www.cun.it/uploads/6359/Parere_28_09_2016.pdf?v=) 122 Professionally oriented degree programs are degree programs that include laboratory activities for at least 48 CFU alongside another 48 CFU for internship-related activities. 152 ----- _The ANVUR “Periodic Accreditation Process”_ After obtaining the initial authorisation, online universities need to undergo a “Periodic accreditation process” (the “Periodic Accreditation Process”) conducted by ANVUR. The Periodic Accreditation Process consists of a verification by ANVUR, using remote documentary review combined with on-site visits, to confirm that the requirements necessary for the initial accreditation of the online university still remain effective as well as to confirm that the online universities provide quality, efficient and effective educational activities. The verification process takes into consideration: - periodic reports online universities prepare regarding their compliance, on an ongoing basis, with the requirements that led to their initial accreditation[123]. The information to be included in such reports is listed in Annex E of Ministerial Decree no. 6 of 7 January 2019 (“Decree 6”); and - the “Indicators of Quality Assurance” in Annex C of Decree 6. The “Indicators of Quality Assurance” are specified in the guidelines issued by ANVUR pursuant to the 2015 ESG and are aimed at confirming compliance with the following requirements: - _R1 Requirement: vision, strategies and policies of the university relating to the quality of teaching and research; - _R1T Requirement for on-line universities: methods of delivery for distance learning and related technological equipment required and used; - _R2 Requirement: effectiveness of university policies for quality assurance (“AQ”); - _R3 Requirement: quality of educational courses; and - _Requirement 4: quality of research and third mission. Further technical requirements for periodic accreditation of remote educational courses are envisaged, including: - planning and organisation of teachers and tutors; - teaching interaction and formative assessments for telematics courses; - staff qualification and provision of teaching materials for telematics courses; - assessment of student learning outcomes; - system integration; and - quality of teaching interaction. Pursuant to the combined provisions of Article 3 and Article 6 of Decree 6, for the purpose of the Periodic Accreditation Process, ANVUR shall also take into account the following criteria, separate and in addition to those outlined in Annex C: - the annual report, prepared by the university’s Evaluation Team (“Nucleo di Valutazione”), concerning the outcomes from their ongoing monitoring and quality control of teaching procedures and research; and - evaluation of information outlined in the “Unique Annual Form” (“Schede Uniche Annuali”) relating to courses and research activities. Thus, based on the above-mentioned criteria, ANVUR shall assess the degree of satisfaction of the Indicators of Quality Assurance in points 1 to 4 of Annex C to Decree 6. In particular, such requirements implement and mirror the recommendations envisaged by the 2015 ESG, thereby establishing guidelines for the proper development of national and institutional quality assurance systems across the EHEA, including cross-border cooperation. Pursuant to Article 3 of Decree 6, periodic accreditation of educational premises is accredited to those premises meeting the requirements for initial accreditation in Annex B (i.e., transparency and integrity) together with the quality requirements in Annex C, following verification by ANVUR on the basis of outcomes from on-site visits carried out by the Commission of Experts for Evaluation (“Commissione di Esperti per la Valutazione” or “Commission of Experts for Evaluation”). 123 Please refer to Article 9, paragraph 2, of Legislative Decree no. 19 of 27 January 2012. 153 ----- Pursuant to Article 5 of Decree 6, periodic accreditation of educational courses is granted to courses meeting the requirements for initial accreditation together with those set out in Requirement R3 in Annex C; this also takes into account the periodic evaluation indicators in Article 6. The verification of these requirements is carried out remotely by ANVUR and is also based on activities of the Evaluation Units (“NUV”). Depending on the outcome of the verification process, ANVUR grants a score ranging from “A” (“very positive”) to “E” (“unsatisfactory”). If the Periodic Accreditation Process for an online university is unsuccessful, the initial authorisation will be revoked using a specific decree of the MIUR. The Periodic Accreditation Process is carried out every five years on universities, and every three years on educational courses. _The ANVUR Research Quality Assessment_ Since its establishment, ANVUR has assessed the quality of the research produced by universities and research institutions, mainly using peer review, as prescribed by the Presidential Decree no. 76 of 1 February 2010 (Article 3, paragraphs 1(a) and 2(b)). The Research Quality Assessment (“Valutazione della Qualità della Ricerca” or “VQR”) evaluates the research conducted by public universities and research institutions; private institutions voluntarily submit their research for evaluation. The VQR provides an up-to-date assessment of the state of research in various scientific fields, in order to promote improvements to research quality in the institutions under scrutiny and to allocate performancebased shares of the Ordinary Financing Fund for the Italian university system (“Fondo di Finanziamento _Ordinario” or “FFO”)._ Currently, VQR is carried out every five years (pursuant to Law No. 232) once a special decree is issued by the MIUR establishing the guidelines for the VQR and providing the resources necessary to carry out this research assessment exercise. The most recently available results are those from the second VQR (covering the years 2011-2014), published in February 2017. The third VQR (covering the years 2015-2019) was launched with the approval of the Ministerial Decrees No. 1110 of 29 November 2019 and of 11 August 2020; the findings from this VQR will be made public in October 2021.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,
625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,Regulation,58.1.2,,"The implementation of national regulations on online universities was encouraged at European level with the European Resolution 2001/C 204/02) of 13 July 2001 issued by the European Council on e-Learning. This Resolution invited both Members State and the European Commission to consider adopting a series of actions aimed at implementing and strengthening the e-Learning system in the educational sector, as well as to seek new learning methods and approaches, and promote virtual mobility and transnational campus projects. The European Parliament and the European Council later, pursuant to Decision No. 2318/2003/CE of 5 December 2003 aimed to support the initiatives of the EU Member States in the field of distance learning, with the effective integration of information and communications technologies (“ICT”) systems in education and training, prioritizing the university as a sector of focus. Following a proposal made by the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (“ENQA”) in cooperation with the European Students’ Union (“ESU”), the Ministers responsible for higher education adopted the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (“EHEA”) in 2005 and revised the standards in May 2015 (the “2015 ESG”). The 2015 ESG are a set of standards and guidelines for internal and external assurance of quality in higher education and are focused on ensuring the quality of learning and teaching in higher education, including learning and appropriate links with research and innovation. In this respect, the purposes of the 2015 ESG are to: (i) improve the educational offering for EHEA students; (ii) help higher education institutions manage and improve their quality and thereby justify their autonomy; (iii) provide for work carried out by quality assurance agencies; and (iv) make external quality assurance more transparent and easier to understand by all stakeholders.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The evaluation process lasted around 8 months. In addition to the university-wide QA system, four courses (Civil Engineering, Exercise Sciences, Economic Science and Law) and two faculties (Law and Human Sciences) were assessed.

In the following years, Pegaso acquired the authorisation to provide eleven further courses, namely: - Civil Engineering (Class L-7); - Humanities, Cultures and Education (Class L-10)[124]; - Tourism Sciences (Class L-15); - Business Administration (Class L-18); - Sport Sciences (Class L-22); - Economic Sciences (Class LM-56); - Security Engineering (Class LM-26)[125]; - Modern Linguistics (Class LM-39)[126]; - Pedagogical Sciences (Class LM-85); - Management of Sport and Physical Activities (Class LM-47); and - Philosophy and Ethics (Class L-5)[127]. 124 Initial accreditation decree no. 353 of 14 July 2020 (beginning in academic year 2020/2021 for three years). 125 Initial accreditation decree no. 460 of 15 June 2016 (beginning in academic year 2016/2017). 126 Initial accreditation decree no. 353 of 14 July 2020 (beginning in academic year 2020/2021 for three years). 127 Initial accreditation decree no. 997 of 28 July 2021 (beginning in academic year 2021/2022 for three years). 154 ----- In general, Multiversity’s institutions have a 95% course accreditation rate.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,
625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,Mercatorum,58.3.1,Results of the ANVUR Periodic Authorisation Process,"During the last Periodic Authorisation Process, Mercatorum obtained a 5.51 rating. Nucleus is working on monitoring the criticisms and presenting ANVUR with a report to objectively asset out how the criticisms will be addressed. The evaluation process lasted around 8 months. In addition to the university-wide QA system, all three courses (Tourism Sciences, Business Management and Management) and the Economics faculty were assessed. The final report of the Commission of Experts for Evaluation was submitted to ANVUR on 22 February 2018. Mercatorum obtained positive evaluations of: - the adequacy of teaching and research policies; - planning of courses of study and updates of the same; - establishing an internal research register; and - its strategy for the third mission. _Establishment of Pegaso and Mercatorum_ According to their respective by-laws, both Pegaso and Mercatorum qualify as private entities pursuant to Article 1, para. 2 of the Royal Decree No. 1592/1933, having legal personality and, in the case of Mercatorum, with the aim of pursuing public purposes. As for all the Italian universities, under article 33 of the Constitution of the Republic of Italy, Pegaso and Mercatorum have didactic, organizational, administrative, financial and disciplinary autonomy. To pursue their respective institutional purposes, Pegaso and Mercatorum have, according to Article 26 of Law No. 289/2002 and ministerial decree of April 17, 2003, the primary task of carrying out, in addition to research and study activities, training activities through the use of distance learning methodologies with particular regard to e-learning applications. Pegaso is promoted and supported by Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. whereas Mercatorum is promoted and supported by the company Unimercatorum S.r.l., (each a “Promoter”). Pursuant to the by-laws of each of Pegaso and Mercatorum and of each Promoter, each institution’s Promoter shall ensure the pursuit of the relevant university’s institutional objectives and provide the means and any specific services as may be necessary, indispensable and instrumental, also through the provision of funding and/or arrangements with suppliers, for the functioning and pursuit of the relevant university’s institutional purposes. The by-laws also provide that each university may also regulate its relationship with its Promoter by means of a specific agreement in order to pursue its institutional purpose and the related means and specific services as may be necessary, indispensable or instrumental, for its functioning and the pursuit of its institutional purposes. Pegaso and Mercatorum each have in place specific agreements/arrangements with their respective Promoters that serve to guarantee the financial capability of the universities and, as a consequence, ensure the continuity of their didactic activities. Since Mercatorum recorded a net profit for the 2020 financial year, thereby concluding it with a positive net equity and achieving full economic and financial balance, it recognized the amount required to be calculated under the promotion and support agreement to the Promoter in the profit and loss statement. The 128 https://www.anvur.it/attivita/ava/accreditamento-periodico/rapporti-anvur-di-accreditamento-periodico/ 155 ----- contribution is accounted as a cost in Mercatorum and as income in Unimercatorum s.r.l., with no effect at consolidation level. As a consequence, the income of Mercatorum remains within the Group. Further to the reorganization in 2019, Pegaso was transformed into a private corporation (see “—Transformation _of Pegaso into a private corporation” below), whereas Mercatorum remains a non-commercial entity. Transformation of Pegaso into a private corporation_ On November 19, 2018, Pegaso’s board of directors resolved upon the transformation of Pegaso, as a private online university, into a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) named “Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l.”, and the relevant amendments to the by-laws in order to effect such change. With its note No. 5726 of November 20, 2018, Pegaso notified the MIUR of the abovementioned resolution, in order to obtain its favourable opinion. Given the complexity of such decision, the MIUR, with its note No. 645 of January 14, 2019, informed Pegaso that the approval of the transformation should have been subject to the prior opinion of the Council of State (i.e. the Supreme Administrative Court). In the plenary assembly (adunanza plenaria) of May 9, 2019, the Council of State granted its favourable opinion confirming that the current legislation on universities set out under the Royal Decree No. 1592/1933 (as subsequently amended) and Law non-commercial entities into private corporations. However, in the absence of a specific regulatory framework on the implementation of the corporate models with regard to universities, the Council of State however, required an intervention by the Italian Legislator aimed at realigning and reorganising the sector following and as a result of the introduction of the new possible corporation structure of private universities, as recognized by the Decision of the Council of State which was not in this orientation initially issued. A partial modification was made with the inclusion for the first time in the 2020 Italian Budget Law (Legge di Bilancio 2020), in article 1, paragraph 721, concerning the treatment of non-public universities for the purposes of income taxes, of a provision for legally recognized free non-public universities not constituted in the legal form of commercial companies. Postulating, therefore, already de facto existence. In light of this, the Council of State recommended that the Government should further evaluate whether to propose legislative reforms before the Parliament, also to the consolidated text referred to in Royal Decree no. 1592/1933, in order update the regulatory framework and adapt it better to the transformation of open private universities into private corporations. See further “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Business and Industry—Multiversity is _subject to various licensing and accreditation requirements in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and its failure to comply with these requirements could expose Multiversity to financial losses and lead to loss of qualified personnel and students.”_ Following the favourable opinion of the Council of State, the MIUR, with note No. 10282 of June 19, 2019 granted its favourable opinion on said transformation and gave its clearance to the consequential amendment of the Pegaso’s by-laws. On June 25, 2019, the procedure for the transformation was positively concluded with the registration of Pegaso in the companies register (registro delle imprese) as a “limited liability company” and the publication in the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic of the new Pegaso by-laws. With reference to the tax regime applicable to Pegaso before its transformation into a private corporation, it has to be noted that the Italian Legislator—in order to clarify the fiscal nature of “free” (or non-State) universities established by private initiatives—enacted a special provision of authentic interpretation having retroactive effect—Article 1, paragraph 721, Law 27 December 2019, n. 160 (hereinafter, the “Provision Of Authentic",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

or (z) any liabilities owed to any Debtor or Shareholder Creditor whether actual or contingent and whether 174 ----- incurred solely or jointly (the “Debtor Liabilities”) owed by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company on the basis that (A) if the Security Agent does not intend that any transferee of those Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities will be treated as a Primary Creditor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of those Liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors or Debtor Liabilities provided that notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if the Security Agent does intend that any transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of (I) all (and not part only) of the Liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors; and (II) all or part of any other Liabilities and the Debtor Liabilities, on behalf of, in each case the relevant Creditors, Debtors and Third Party Security Provider; and (v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent decides to transfer to another Debtor or a holding company of a Debtor all or part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any Subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of (x) the Intra- Group Liabilities;

and (B) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities, Holdco Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the receiving entity or receiving entities to which the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities, Holdco Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities are to be transferred. If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Senior Liabilities and Shared Security will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either: (i) any Senior Notes Trustee has approved the release on the instructions of any Senior Notes Required Holders (as defined below) and any Future Senior Debt Representative (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has approved the release on the instructions of the Future Senior Debt Required Holders (as defined below); or (ii) each of the following conditions is satisfied: (A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); (B) all present and future obligations owed to the secured parties under the Senior Debt Documents by any Senior Notes Issuer, Future Senior Debt Issuer, or a member of the Group all of whose shares are pledged under the Transaction Security are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and such obligations are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Security under the Security Documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released concurrently with such sale; and (C) such sale or disposal is made: (I) pursuant to Competitive Process (being a public or private auction or other competitive sale process in which more than one bidder participates or is invited to participate (including any person invited that is a Primary Creditor (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) at the time of such invitation), which may or may not be conducted through court or other legal proceedings, and which is conducted with the advice of a Financial Advisor) in which the Senior Creditors (or a representative acting on their behalf) shall be entitled to participate as bidder or financier to the potential purchaser and shall be provided equal information rights as any other bidder, subject to applicable securities law (and for the avoidance of doubt in which the Senior Secured Creditors, the Super Senior Creditors or, in each case, a representative acting on their behalf are also entitled to participate); (II) pursuant to any process or proceedings approved or supervised by or on behalf of any court of law which has jurisdiction and where there is a determination of value by or on behalf of such court; or (III) where a Financial Advisor has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement and the circumstances giving rise 175 ----- to such sale, provided that the liability of Financial Advisor in giving such opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement. If prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Senior Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, instructions, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or Holding Company that is a member of the Group from any Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Super Senior Creditor unless those Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent Liability relating to a Letter of Credit, Cash Management Facility LC, a Cash Management Facility or an Ancillary Facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor), following that release. _Application of Proceeds of a Distressed Disposal_ The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Application of Proceeds/ _Waterfall” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the_ extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if the disposal of liabilities had not occurred. _Voting and Amendments_ Voting in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes and/or Future Pari Passu Debt will be in accordance with the relevant documents.

Notwithstanding the paragraph immediately above, subject to certain exceptions, including in relation to the implementation of certain future indebtedness as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement, an amendment or waiver relating to provisions dealing with (i) the definition of “Instructing Group,” (ii) ranking and priority, (iii) turnover of receipts, (iv) redistribution, (v) enforcement of Transaction Security, (vi) proceeds of disposals, (vii) application of proceeds, (viii) consents, amendments and overrides, and (ix) certain provisions relating to the instructions to and exercise of discretion by the Security Agent or (x) the order of priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement, shall not be made without the written consent of: (a) each Creditor Representative acting in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Debt Documents; (b) the Cash Management Facility Lenders (or relevant Cash Management Facility Agent on their behalf, if appointed) (to the extent that the amendment or waiver (i) would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of the Cash Management Facility Lenders under the Intercreditor Agreement in their capacity as such and (ii) would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other Creditor or class of Creditors, in each case other than the Cash Management Facility Lenders (solely in their capacity as such)); 176 ----- (c) each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent that the amendment or waiver (i) would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of the Hedge Counterparties in their capacity as such and (ii) would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other Creditor or class of Creditors, in each case other than the Hedge Counterparties (solely in their capacity as such)); and (d) the Issuer. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that: (a) “Future Pari Passu Debt Required Holders” means, in respect of any direction, approval, consent or waiver, the Future Pari Passu Creditors holding in aggregate a principal amount of Future Pari Passu Debt which is not less than the principal amount of Future Pari Passu Debt required to vote in favor of such direction, consent or waiver under the terms of the Future Pari Passu Debt Document or, if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding Future Pari Passu Debt in accordance with the relevant Future Pari Passu Debt Documents; (b) “Future Senior Debt Required Holders” means, in respect of any direction, approval, consent or waiver, the Future Senior Creditors holding in aggregate a principal amount of Future Senior Debt which is not less than the principal amount of Future Senior Debt required to vote in favor of such direction, consent or waiver under the terms of the Future Senior Debt Document or, if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding Future Senior Debt in accordance with the relevant Future Senior Debt Documents; (c) “Senior Notes Required Holders” means, in respect of any direction, approval, consent or waiver, the holders of any Senior Notes holding in aggregate a principal amount of Senior Notes which is not less than the principal amount of Senior Notes required to vote in favor of such direction, consent or waiver under the terms of any Senior Notes Documents or, if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes (as applicable) in accordance with the applicable Senior Notes Documents;

or (b) either (i) a prescribed acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility, a Cash Management Facility Document, the Notes, the Future Pari Passu Debt, any Senior Notes or the Future Senior Debt, or (ii) the enforcement of any Transaction Security (a “Distress Event”), the holders of the Notes, the Cash Management Facilities Lenders and the Future Pari Passu Creditors shall have an option to purchase all (but not part) of the RCF Lenders’ (or their affiliates) commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and all the exposures in respect of any Priority Hedging Agreements at par plus accrued interest and all other amounts owing under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and the Priority Hedging Agreements, with such purchase to occur all at the same time. 177 ----- Following (a) any notice that the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or (b) a Distress Event, the holders of any Senior Notes and the Future Senior Debt Creditors shall have an option to purchase all (but not part) of the Senior Secured Debt at par plus accrued interest and all other amounts owing in respect of such Senior Secured Debt, with such purchase to occur all at the same time. _Hedging_ All scheduled payments (or another ordinary course payment, including in relation to fees, costs and expenses) or Adjustment Payments (as such term is defined in the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. on September 19, 2018) or equivalent payment permitted under a Hedging Agreement (other than certain close out payments whilst a Senior Secured Default is continuing (or payments when a scheduled payment from the hedging counterparty is due and unpaid)) are permitted payments for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions in relation to the circumstances in which a Priority Hedge Counterparty and a Non-Priority Hedge Counterparty may take Enforcement Action in relation to its hedging. _Provisions Following an IPO_ On, following or in contemplation of an initial public offering of a member of the Group (or a holding company thereof) (an “IPO”), the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the entity who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity”), and its respective Restricted Subsidiaries, provided that if any Senior Notes (or debt ranking pari passu therewith) are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be the Senior Notes Issuer (or other pari passu debt issuer) for the purposes of the Senior Liabilities (if applicable) and the direct subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer for the purposes of the Group, all other Liabilities and all related provisions, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity. Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under the Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security, including Shared Security), and each Subordinated Creditor or Senior Notes Issuer will be released from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity. Subject to the consent of the requisite majority lenders under each applicable class of debt (being the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Senior Creditors, the Issuer and each other member of the Group and each Third Party Security Provider shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, Borrowing Liabilities)). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement (other than a member of the Group) shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate the matters described in each of the above paragraphs under the heading “—Provisions Following an IPO.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Senior Notes and any Future Senior Debt are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO, for the purposes of the Group or Senior Liabilities, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of any Senior Liabilities and, for the purposes of the Group or Liabilities other than the Senior Liabilities (and all related provisions), the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be the direct subsidiary thereof and (ii) if the Senior Notes and any Future Senior Debt have been refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO Event but the Senior Secured Notes and any Future Pari Passu Debt have not been refinanced in full on or before then, the Issuer shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity and the Group (and all related provisions) shall continue to comprise the Issuer and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time. _Debt Transfer_ Provided certain conditions are met, the Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any Creditor in respect of all or part of any Liabilities owing by a Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Credit Facility Borrower (a “Debt Transfer Borrower”) in respect of its Liabilities (including borrowing liabilities) under the applicable Debt Documents be novated or otherwise transferred by that Debt Transfer Borrower (a “Debt",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,
625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1223,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS[129],1223.8,Liabilities”) shall not be secured by the Transaction Security or any Senior Notes Only Security.,1223.8.2,,"If security is to be granted for certain future indebtedness (including Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, additional senior secured notes, Future Pari Passu Debt, Future Senior Debt and any future Senior Notes) (“Future Debt”), to the extent such Future Debt cannot be secured with the agreed ranking without the existing security first being released, the Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions that such Future Debt will (to the extent permitted by applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of additional security documents securing the same assets subject to the relevant security on a second- or lesser-ranking basis and such Future Debt will nonetheless be deemed and treated for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by such security pari passu with corresponding liabilities which would otherwise have the same ranking as contemplated above and any amounts to be applied towards such Future Debt shall be applied accordingly. In the event that it is not possible to permit the recreation of additional security documents as referred to above, no amendments or release and retaking of security under the existing security documents shall be permitted without the consent of the required creditors under the documents thereby secured unless permitted by such documents. _Payments and Prepayments; Subordination of any Senior Notes_ The Debtors and the Third Party Security Provider may make payments and prepayments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes at any time in accordance with their terms and may prepay or acquire the Notes. Any Senior Notes Issuer may make payments and prepayments in respect of any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities (including by prepaying or acquiring any Senior Notes) at any time in accordance with the terms of any Senior Notes Indenture, any Senior Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement provided that such payment is not made from assets subject to Transaction Security and not financed by a payment from a member of the Group that was prohibited at such time by any of the Credit Facility Documents, Senior Secured Notes Documents and Future Pari Passu Debt Documents. Prior to the discharge of all Senior Secured Liabilities, no Debtor, Third Party Security Provider or other member of the Group may make payments in respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities without the consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority Senior Secured Creditors except as described in the foregoing paragraph or as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement including (without limitation and subject to conditions where applicable) the following: (1) if: (a) the payment is of: (i) any of the principal or interest (including capitalized interest) amount of any Senior Notes Liabilities which is either (1) not prohibited from being paid by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Cash Management Facility Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Documents or any Future Pari Passu Debt Document or (2) is paid on or after the final maturity of any Senior Notes; or (ii) any other amount in respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest accrued due and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of any Senior Notes Documents or a corresponding amount under any Holdco Debt Document (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement); (b) no notice delivered pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement blocking payments in respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities (a “Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice”) is outstanding; and (c) no Senior Secured Debt Payment Default (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has occurred and is continuing; or (2) certain amounts due to any Senior Notes Trustee for its own account; or (3) payments of amounts equal to any payment accrued pursuant to any Senior Notes or any Senior Notes guarantee immediately after the period during which any Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice is outstanding or a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default ceases to be continuing and which would otherwise have been a permitted payment pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; or 166 ----- (4) for so long as a Senior Secured Debt Event of Default is continuing certain payments as a result of any Senior Notes Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged in exchange for the issuance of shares in any holding company of any Senior Notes Issuer, subject to certain conditions; (5) certain payments of non-cash interest by way of capitalization; (6) payments funded with the incurrence of Senior Notes Liabilities; (7) costs, commissions, taxes, advisory or professional fees, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) any Senior Notes Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under any Senior Notes Documents), subject to certain conditions; (8) audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes and other proper and incidental expenses required to maintain existence or any other reasonable and ordinary course administrative and maintenance costs of a Senior Notes Issuer or its Affiliates; (9) costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) any refinancing of any Senior Notes in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes Documents, the Cash Management Facility Documents and any Future Pari Passu Debt Document, subject to certain conditions; (10) payments of certain reasonable and customary consent or amendment/waiver fees in connection with amendments to any Senior Notes Documents; (11) payments in connection with purchases, repurchases or redemptions of Senior Notes permitted under the Credit Facility Documents, Cash Management Facility Documents, Senior Secured Notes Documents and Future Pari Passu Debt Documents; or (12) payment of any other amount not exceeding €3,500,000 in aggregate in any twelve month period (which may be carried forward if not used). Substantially equivalent provisions and restrictions apply in respect of any Future Senior Debt, mutatis mutandis. Prior to the discharge of all the Senior Secured Debt, if a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has occurred and is continuing all payments in respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and certain amounts due to any Senior Notes Trustee for its own account) will be suspended. In addition, if a Senior Secured Debt Event of Default (other than a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default) (each a “Senior Secured Default”) has occurred and is continuing and any Senior Notes Trustee has received a Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice from either the RCF Agent, the Cash Management Facility Agent or the Trustee or the representative of the Future Pari Passu Debt (the “Relevant Representative”), all payments in respect of any Senior Notes Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority Senior Secured Creditors and certain amounts due to any Senior Notes Trustee for its own account) are suspended until the earliest of: (a) the date on which there is a waiver, remedy or cure of such Senior Secured Default in accordance with the relevant finance documents; or (b) 179 days after the receipt by any Senior Notes Trustee of the Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice; (c) the repayment and discharge of all obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities; (d) the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice (and, if at such time a Senior Secured Default is continuing in relation to the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Senior Secured Liabilities in respect of which the notice was given), the Relevant Representative(s) in respect of those other Senior Secured Liabilities) notify/ies (amongst others) any Senior Notes Trustee that the Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice is cancelled; (e) the date on which the Security Agent or Senior Notes Trustee takes any Enforcement Action against a member of the Group which it is permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement; (f) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Default is no longer continuing and if the relevant Senior Secured Liabilities have been accelerated such acceleration has been rescinded (and if such acceleration consisted solely of declaring the relevant debt payable on demand, such rescission can be effected by the relevant majority creditors in respect of the relevant debt); or (g) if a Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of a Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice, the date on which the Standstill Period expires, 167 ----- provided that none of the circumstances described in this paragraph, nor those described in the paragraph above shall prevent any Senior Notes Issuer from making payments in respect of any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the relevant documentation from its own assets (excluding at all times any assets which are subject to Transaction Security) provided that such payment is not financed by a payment to any Senior Notes Issuer from a member of the Group that was prohibited by then existing (if any) Credit Facility Documents the Senior Secured Notes Documents and Future Pari Passu Debt Documents. Unless waived by any Senior Notes Trustee, (a) no new Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative unless 360 days have elapsed since the immediately prior Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice and (b) no Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Secured Debt Event of Default more than 60 days after the date that the Relevant Representative received notice of that Senior Secured Default. No Relevant Representative may serve more than one Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances, and no Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Secured Event of Default notified to a Relevant Representative at the time at which an earlier Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice was issued. If a Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding or the relevant Senior Secured Debt Payment Default has ceased to be continuing (by being waived by the Relevant Representative or remedied) the relevant Debtor may then make those payments it would have otherwise been entitled to pay under any Senior Notes and if it does so promptly any event of default under any Senior Notes caused by such delayed payment shall be waived and any enforcement notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived. A Senior Secured Debt Payment Default is remedied by the payment of all amounts then due. _Restrictions on Enforcement by any Senior Notes; Senior Notes Standstill_ Without prejudice to the rights of the Senior Creditors to take Enforcement Action in relation to any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities and/or any Senior Notes Only Security, prior to the discharge of all the Senior Secured Liabilities, neither any Senior Notes Trustee nor the holders of any Senior Notes may take Enforcement Action with respect to any Senior Notes (including any action against any Senior Notes Issuer or the guarantors of any Senior Notes (if any)) or direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any relevant Transaction Security document (including the Shared Security) without the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group (as defined below), except that such restriction will not apply in relation to any Senior Notes Guarantee Liabilities and Shared Security if (1) an event of default has occurred under any Senior Notes resulting from failure to pay principal at final maturity or (2): (a) an event of default under any Senior Notes Indenture is continuing; (b) the RCF Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities have received notice of the specified event of default from any Senior Notes Trustee; (c) a Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and (d) the relevant event of default is continuing at the end of the Standstill Period. A “Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that any Senior Notes Trustee serves an enforcement notice on the RCF Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities until the earliest of: (a) 179 days after such date; (b) the date on which the Security Agent takes Enforcement Action (including the enforcement of any Transaction Security permitted to be enforced under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), provided that any Senior Notes Trustee and holders of Senior Notes may only take the same Enforcement Action against the same entity as is taken by the Senior Secured Creditors and may not take any other action against any other member of the Group; (c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of any guarantor of any Senior Notes against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and (d) the expiration of any other Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the current Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or permitted remedy thereof). If an Event of Default ceases to be continuing then (provided the relevant parties are made aware of such fact) any relevant enforcement process (including any requirement of consultation relating to enforcement) relying solely on that Event of Default shall cease to continue. Substantially similar provisions to those described in this section with respect to any Senior Notes are included in the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to Future Senior Debt and related Future Senior Creditors. 168 ----- If the Security Agent has notified any Senior Notes Trustee that it is enforcing Transaction Security, no other Senior Notes Creditor may take any enforcement action against the Third Party Security Provider, that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Transaction Security where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom. If any Senior Notes Creditors are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to require the enforcement of such Transaction Security, such Enforcement Action must require the realization of the relevant Security by way of a sale or disposal conducted in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. _Consultation_ Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction Security and/or the requesting of a distressed disposal and/or the release or disposal of claims and/or Transaction Security on a distressed disposal (“Enforcement”), the relevant representative of the Super Senior Liabilities or the Senior Secured Liabilities (as applicable) shall notify the Security Agent and the creditor representatives for each of the Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors that the applicable Transaction Security has become enforceable. As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit instructions with respect to the enforcement of the Transaction Security or the taking of any other Enforcement Action by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following which, the RCF Agent (acting on the instructions of the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors), the Cash Management Facility Agent, the representative of any Future Pari Passu Creditors and the Trustee will consult in good faith with each other and the Security Agent for a period of 15 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or such shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy (the “Consultation Period”). No such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of the Consultation Period), in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security Enforcement Principles set forth below (“Qualifying Instructions”) where: (a) any of the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting any Senior Notes Issuer, the Issuer, or a borrower or a guarantor or any member (or members) of the Group that is or are a Significant Subsidiary or a Significant Group (each a “Relevant Company”); or (b) subject to no instructions having been given by an Instructing Group in the circumstances described below, the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine in good faith (and notify each other representative agent of the Super Senior Creditors, each Cash Management Facility, the Senior Secured Creditors, the Future Pari Passu Creditors and the Security Agent) that any delay caused by such consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be realized to a level such that (following application thereof in accordance with the Payment Waterfall described below) the Super Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full and in this case any instructions will be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors or, as the case may be, the Super Senior Creditors, on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received. If following the Consultation Period, the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement the same. Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes the failure to give instructions is deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received by the end of the Consultation Period, the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security and/ or take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in each case provided such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all instructions received by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed revoked. If the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the security in a manner which is not consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles, subject to (a) and (b) above, the relevant representative shall give notice to the other representatives after which each such representative shall consult with the Security Agent for a period of 10 days (or such lesser period as the relevant representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of Enforcement, provided that such representatives shall not be obliged to consult more than once in relation to each Enforcement Action. 169 ----- For the purposes of Enforcement, an “Instructing Group” means if prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if: (a) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been repaid in full within six months of the end of the Consultation Period (or within six months of the delivery of a specified notice by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, where no consultation period is required); (b) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period (or within three months of the delivery of a specified notice by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, where no consultation period is required); or (c) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with respect to such Relevant Company, then the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions) to the exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting with any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) and the Instructing Group in relation to such Enforcement shall mean the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors. Subject to the foregoing, in the event of Conflicting Enforcement Instructions, the “Instructing Group” shall mean the Majority Senior Secured Creditors provided that such instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors are Qualifying Instructions, it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the timeframe for the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal pursuant to such instructions will be determined by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors. Prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date: (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Shared Security; or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group in relation to the Shared Security, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Shared Security which the Majority Senior Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) are then entitled to give to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, as described under the heading “—Restrictions on Enforcement by any Senior Notes; Senior Notes Standstill” below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time any Senior Creditor or its Creditor Representative is then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Shared Security and the Majority Senior Creditors do not give such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Shared Security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given by the Senior Creditors or its Creditor Representative under this Agreement and Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group. For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of any Senior Notes Only Security where the Security Agent will act in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Creditors (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). _Security Enforcement Principles_ Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Cash Management Facility Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Senior Secured Notes Required Holders (as defined below) (if prior to the Senior Secured Notes Discharge Date), the Future Pari Passu Debt Required Holders (as defined below) and the Issuer, enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which are summarized as follows: (a) It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from Enforcement of the Transaction Security, the recovery by the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Notes Creditors and the Future Pari Passu Creditors (the “Security Enforcement Objective”). (b) The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either (i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all cash) for distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or (ii) if Enforcement is at the direction of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Senior Creditors, sufficient proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance 170 ----- with the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise). (c) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the Enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal (as defined below) pursuant to Enforcement will be determined by the Instructing Group provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective. (d) On (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5,000,000 (or its equivalent); or (ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent shall (unless such enforcement is made pursuant to a public auction or process supervised by a court of law which makes a determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert (A) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Principles and maximize recovery of any such Enforcement Action, (B) that the proceeds received from enforcement is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. (e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement. The liability of any Financial Advisor in respect of the opinions referred to in paragraph (d) above may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement. (f) The Financial Advisor’s opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met. (g) In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares referred to in (d)(i) above and such Enforcement is conducted by way of public auction, any equity investors of the Group shall be entitled to participate in such auction. There is no requirement in the Security Enforcement Principles that requires the Enforcement of Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction. (h) In the absence of written notice from a creditor or group of creditors that are not part of the relevant Instructing Group that such creditor(s) object to any Enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an “Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. (i) If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance with this Agreement), a Financial Advisor’s opinion to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the requirement of paragraph (a) above has been met. For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of any Senior Notes Only Security. _Turnover_ The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if any Super Senior Creditor, Cash Management Facility Creditor, Senior Secured Notes Creditor, Senior Creditor and Future Pari Passu Creditor receives or recovers the proceeds of any Enforcement of Transaction Security (whether before or after an insolvency event) or any Senior Notes Only Security other than in accordance with Payments Waterfall that it shall (subject to certain prior actual knowledge qualifications in the case of the Trustee and any Senior Notes Trustee, as applicable): - in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities of that creditor (or, if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount or an amount equal to that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and 171 ----- (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and - in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Certain further turnover obligations following receipt of non-permitted payments apply to Senior Notes Creditors, Future Senior Creditors and Subordinated Creditors. _Application of Proceeds/Waterfall_ All amounts received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization or Enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security (and, in relation to the Senior Creditors, Shared Security) or otherwise paid to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement for application in accordance with the Payments Waterfall (the “Enforcement Proceeds”), other than with respect to any Senior Notes Only Security, will be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the following payments waterfall in each case to the extent that security has been given in favor of such obligations (the “Payments Waterfall”): - _first, in payment of the following amounts in the following order (i) pari passu and pro rata any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any of its delegates and any Trustee Liabilities as the case may be, and then (ii) pari passu and pro rata to each Creditor Representative (as the term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (to the extent not included in (i) above and excluding any Hedge Counterparty as its own Creditor Representative) of the costs and expenses of each such Creditor Representative and any receiver, attorney or agent appointed by such Creditor Representative under any Transaction Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreement;

- _fourth, pari passu and pro rata to the Cash Management Facility[131]_ Agent on behalf of the Cash Management Facility Creditors, the Trustee on behalf of the Senior Secured Noteholders and to the relevant Creditor Representative on behalf of the Future Pari Passu Creditors for application towards any unpaid costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of any Cash Management Facility Creditors, holders of Notes and Future Pari Passu Creditors in connection with any realization or enforcement of the Transaction Security taken in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;

- _seventh, and only to the extent that the Senior Creditors are entitled to the relevant recoveries, pari passu and pro rata to any Senior Notes Trustee on behalf of holders of any Senior Notes for application towards the discharge of any Senior Notes Liabilities (in accordance with the relevant documents) and to the relevant Creditor Representative on behalf of the Future Senior Creditors for application towards the discharge of the Future Senior Debt (in accordance with the relevant documents); and - _eighth, after the Final Discharge Date, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider or other person entitled to it. For the avoidance of doubt (other than as provided above) payments of Enforcement Proceeds may only be made to the Trustee for the holders of the Notes, if all payments then due and payable under the Revolving Credit Facility to the RCF Lenders, ancillary lenders and issuing bank and to the Priority Hedge Counterparties in respect of the Priority Hedging Liabilities and the other payments referred to under “thirdly” above have been paid in full. All amounts received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization or Enforcement of all or any part of any Senior Notes Only Security will be applied in accordance with a separate payments waterfall as follows: - _first, in payment of the following amounts in the following order (i) pari passu and pro rata any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any of its delegates and any Trustee Liabilities, as the case may be, and then (ii) pari passu and pro rata to each Creditor Representative of the holders of any Senior Notes and the Future Senior Creditors of the costs and expenses of each such Creditor Representative and any receiver, attorney or agent appointed by such Creditor Representative under any Senior Notes Only Security document or the Intercreditor Agreement; - _second, pari passu and pro rata, to any Senior Notes Trustee and to the relevant Creditor Representative on behalf of the Future Senior Creditors in or towards payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the by the holders of any Senior Notes and any of Future Senior Creditors in connection with any realization or enforcement of any Senior Notes Only Security taken in accordance with the terms of any Senior Notes Only Security documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent; - _third, pari passu and pro rata, to any Senior Notes Trustee on behalf of the holders of any Senior Notes for application towards the discharge of any Senior Notes Liabilities (in accordance with the relevant documents) and to the relevant Creditor Representative on behalf of the Future Senior Creditors for application towards the discharge of the Future Senior Debt (in accordance with the relevant documents); and - _fourth, after the Senior Debt Discharge Date, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider or other person entitled to it. _Acceleration_ If an event of default occurs under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes or Future Pari Passu Debt then any decision to accelerate the Revolving Credit Facility or Notes or Future Pari Passu Debt and, subject as provided below, to take any other Enforcement Action will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture (or other relevant Senior Secured Notes Indenture) or in accordance with the terms of the Future Pari Passu Debt (as applicable).

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.1,General,21.1.1,The Notes,"The Notes will, upon issuance: - be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer and other obligations that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Revolving Credit Facility; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; - rank effectively senior to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is unsecured to the extent of the value of the Collateral; - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, such Subsidiary will pay the holders of its debt and its trade creditors before it will be able to distribute any of its assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor, if any. Following the Issue Date, it is expected that the primary operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than future Guarantors, if any). As of September 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries would have had €801.8 million principal amount of indebtedness, of which €765.0 million is represented by the Notes and €36.8 million would be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. This does not include the Bridge to Cash Facility that will be secured by the Cash Available held by Multiversity S.p.A., to the extent of the amount of the Cash Available and will be repaid from the Cash Available within 2 of Business Days following the completion and effectiveness of the Post-Closing Reorganisation. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.2,Principal and Maturity,21.2.1,Interest,"Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero) plus 181 ----- (ii) % per annum, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”), who shall initially be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. Interest on the Notes will: - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid; - be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on,, and, commencing on, 2022; - be payable to the holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Notes. “Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period. “EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date; provided that, EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London or Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, EURIBOR for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London or Frankfurt, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, EURIBOR for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then EURIBOR for the Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. If the Issuer determines, prior to any Determination Date, that: (1) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR; (2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently; (3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR; (4) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or (5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to calculate any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR, a Rate Determination Agent, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall select with the prior consent of the Issuer a successor rate to EURIBOR that has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that is expected to develop or has developed as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Notes in the European leveraged finance market or which has been adopted in other debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Notes which have been issued by a company owned by the Sponsor in the European leveraged finance market (with no applicable adjustment spread) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least three Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such Successor Rate (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall be bound by any such Successor Rate without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the Successor Rate shall, in all cases, not be less than 0%. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate. Following the adoption of any Successor Rate, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate. 182 ----- “euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro. “Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date. “Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed by the Issuer at the expense of the Issuer, or, (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under (a), the Issuer. “Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. “Reuters Page EURIBOR01” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or, if no such page is available, such other page as may replace that page on such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro. The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable law. The Issuer shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal at a rate that is 1% higher than the then-applicable interest rate on the Notes to the extent lawful; it will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue instalments of interest, if any (without regard to any applicable grace period), at the same rate to the extent lawful. The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Although there will be no initial Guarantors, if required by the covenant as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility, Public Debt or certain other indebtedness shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein), post-closing, sufficient guarantors will accede within 120 days of the earlier of (a) the Post-Closing Reorganisation and (b) the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date such that entities contributing 80% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group that are located in Guarantor Jurisdictions (as defined herein) and each Material Company (being each contributing 5% or more of Consolidated EBITDA of the Group on an unconsolidated basis) become, subject to Agreed Security Principles, guarantors, see “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility—Guarantees”. In addition, security is to be granted (subject_ to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares in any additional borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility (including on a limited recourse basis if the relevant shareholder is not a guarantor), and any Material Company or other member of the Group located in a Guarantor Jurisdiction which becomes a guarantor of the Revolving Credit Facility is required (subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and certain limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of any notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations— Limitations on Granting Security Interests and Guarantees under Italian Law”) to grant security over shares in_ any Material Company that is its wholly-owned subsidiary and (if wholly owned by other members of the Group) to have its own shares (or equivalent ownership interests) secured in favor of the Security Agent (including on a limited recourse basis if the relevant shareholder is not a guarantor). For the avoidance of doubt, no security shall be granted by (or over the quota in or loans made to) Target or MultiSpA. To the extent provided in future, any Notes Guarantee will be a joint and several obligation of each Guarantor. Each Notes Guarantee, if any, will: - be a general senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor, secured as set forth under “Security”; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes Guarantee, including obligations in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes Guarantee; and - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the applicable Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation. Any Notes Guarantees that are subject to limitations under applicable law will be contractually limited under the applicable Notes Guarantee to reflect such limitations with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. In addition, each Notes Guarantee (if any) will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the relevant Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Issuer is _incorporated in Italy, and Italian insolvency laws may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as insolvency laws in other jurisdictions with which they may be familiar ”, “—Fraudulent conveyance and similar laws may_ 184 ----- _adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes and the Collateral”,“—The Collateral and any future guarantees of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Future Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees and security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal or regulatory limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims, works council or other employee consultation requirements and similar principles. The Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor, if any, will automatically terminate and release: (1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture; (2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; (3) upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and _Discharge”;_ (4) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) does not guarantee any other Credit Facility which is a term facility which constitutes Senior Secured Indebtedness or Junior Lien Indebtedness or Public Debt; (5) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”; (7) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants— _Additional Notes Guarantees”;_ (8) as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited by the covenant described below under “—Certain _Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;_ (9) in connection with an IPO Debt Pushdown in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement; or (10) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants— _Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, additional security interests_ may be granted over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, including for the benefit of any Additional Notes issued by the Issuer as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Collateral and _any Future Notes Guarantees”._ Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral”.

The following is a summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles: - general legal, regulatory and statutory limitations, financial assistance (including under Article 2358 and/or 2374 of the Italian Civil Code), capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, transfer pricing, “interest stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions”, “liquidity impairment” rules, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a Notes Guarantee or security or may require that the Notes Guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any such limit applies, the Notes Guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which the relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence) and subject to fiduciary duties of management; - a key factor in determining whether or not a guarantee or security shall be taken is the applicable time and cost (including material adverse tax consequences or adverse effects on interest deductibility and stamp duty, registration taxes, notarisation and registration fees) which shall not be disproportionate to the benefit to the Holders of the Notes of obtaining such guarantee or security; - the giving of a Notes Guarantee, the granting and the terms of security or the perfection of the security granted will not be required to the extent that the Group would incur any legal fees, registration fees, notarial fees, stamp duty, taxes and any other fees or costs directly associated with such security or Notes Guarantee which are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the secured parties and/or having regard to the extent of the obligations which can be guaranteed or secured by that security and the priority that will be offered by taking or perfecting the security. In particular, it is acknowledged that the Issuer and/ or Guarantor have agreed not to opt (where possible) for the Imposta Sostitutiva regime pursuant to article 15 and subsequent of Italian Presidential Decree No. 601/1973 as amended and supplemented from time to time.

Such guarantee and/or security shall not be required unless such consent has been received; - any assets subject to legal requirements, licenses or any other third-party arrangements (including, without limitation, any trade receivables) which may prevent those assets from being charged (or assets which, if charged, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of the Group in respect of those assets or require any member of the Group to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof) will be excluded from any relevant Security Document; no security shall be required over (and no consent or waiver request submitted with respect to) assets which are required to support indebtedness assumed in connection with an acquisition to the extent permitted by the terms of the Notes Documents to remain outstanding following a Permitted Acquisition (“Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness”) and no member of the target group acquired pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition where Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness remains outstanding following completion of such Permitted Acquisition shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security with respect to the Notes Documents if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing such Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness; - members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into Security Documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if the same would conflict with the fiduciary duties of those directors or contravene any legal prohibition, bona fide contractual restriction or any regulatory condition or prohibition or result in (or in a material risk of) personal or criminal liability on the part of any Officer or result in any significant risk of legal liability for the directors of any Group company. Furthermore, members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into Security Documents if the foregoing may, in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer, have an adverse impact on the credit rating of any member of the Group or any debt or other instrument issued by a member of the Group or in respect of which a member of the Group is a trustee, corporate administrator or similar or analogous function or if the relevant member of the Group is acting as a trustee or similar or analogous function in a securitisation, structured financing or other similar arrangement; - additional guarantee limitation provisions may be included in any supplemental indenture if required by any Officer of any member of the Group in connection with the granting of a Notes Guarantee in order to protect that Officer from potential liability or other legal risk; - the terms of the security should not be such that they materially restrict the running of the business of or materially adversely affect the tax arrangements of the relevant member of the Group in the ordinary course as or otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents; - the security will be first ranking, to the extent possible and subject to any Permitted Liens, and shall be limited to security over the shares in each Guarantor, provided that the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the liabilities in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations shall effectively rank in priority to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with respect to proceeds from the enforcement of such security; - information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if and only to the extent, required by local law and local market practice to be provided solely to perfect or register the relevant security interests will be provided annually upon the reasonable request of the Security Agent or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and notice has been provided in accordance with the terms of the Indenture such that immediate repayment of the Notes is required (and such notice has not been withdrawn, cancelled or otherwise ceased to have effect), at the Security Agent’s reasonable request; - perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as reasonably practicable. The giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of security interests granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the 188 ----- relevant Issuer or Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents (and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph); - any Security Document entered into by a member of the Group shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in or otherwise governed or expressed to be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of that member of the Group, provided that security over shares shall be governed by the jurisdiction of incorporation of the member of the Group whose shares are the subject of security; - access to the assets of the Issuer or a Guarantor and the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be restricted or limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the Notes Guarantee or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fees, taxes and duties (and in any event the maximum aggregate amount payable by the Group in respect of fees, costs, expenses, disbursements and non-recoverable value added tax (“VAT”) relating to the provision of guarantees and security shall be limited to an amount to be agreed between the security agent and the Issuer and no guarantee or security will be required until such amount is agreed); - no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where a member of the Group is not incorporated; - no perfection action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group; - the Security Agent will hold one set of security interests for the secured parties to the extent reasonably practicable taking into account local law considerations; - guarantees and security will not be required from or over, or over the assets of, or loans to, any joint venture or similar arrangement or any minority interest or from any member of the Group which is not incorporated or established in a Guarantor Jurisdiction; - no guarantees or security will be required to be given by Wversity or Multiversity S.p.A. or in respect of the shares or other interests held in such entities (or loans made to such entities) by other members of the Group.

The Agreed Security Principles also set out certain additional factors which will apply when determining the extent of the guarantees and the security to be provided and certain additional principles which will be reflected in any security taken. As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility as well as certain Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes and may also secure certain future indebtedness; _provided, however, that pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility_ and counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations will receive the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the holders of the Notes and any Additional Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes”._ We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer. In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. If requested in writing by the Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the applicable Officer’s Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to the applicable redemption date; provided, however, that Holders shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a Global Note deposited with a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Notes, the Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—Future liquidity and cash flow difficulties could prevent us from repaying the Notes when due or repurchasing the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the sale of assets, property and Capital Stock pursuant to a Specified Asset Disposition will not constitute “substantially all assets” for any purpose under the Indenture. 199 ----- The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro- denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) if and as elected by the Issuer, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date or on the date on which such Indebtedness was originally Incurred or committed; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will, if elected by the Issuer, be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing or, at the option of the Issuer, the date when such Indebtedness was first committed. No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a first or junior Lien basis.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The principal amount of the outstanding Notes held by any Directing Holder that does not provide a Position Representation in respect of any Noteholder Direction shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of both the numerator and denominator in determining whether any requisite proportion of Holders of Notes have given the Trustee a particular instruction in respect of the Notes. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification _Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee, any Position_ Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or its nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (which shall also be provided to any such Holder) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant and (ii) has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant or (ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the 226 ----- right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (or 150 days for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2021), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (A) if a Default (including an Event of Default) has occurred but is no longer continuing (a “Cured Default”), any other Default or Event of Default which would not have arisen but for the Cured Default having occurred shall be deemed not to be continuing automatically upon, and simultaneous with the remedy, cure or waiver of the Cured Default, (B) if a Default (including an Event of Default) occurs for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate, notice or other document in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is remedied or waived, such Default (including an Event of Default) for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate, notice or other document or information in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (C) any Default (including an Event of Default) for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant “Reports” herein, or otherwise to deliver any notice, certificate or other document, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture or any other Notes Document shall be deemed to be cured and remedied upon the delivery of any such report or statements or information required by such covenant or notice, certificate or other document or performance of such obligation, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture or any other Notes Document. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunding to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions, steps or proceedings in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action, steps or proceedings directly.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Except as set forth below, each series of the Notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of BookEntry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose. So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/ or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that, subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts,” the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers as discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.” Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the 269 ----- Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the Securities Act. In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest. The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Euro MTF Market. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time. Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of BookEntry Interests. In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes (subject to receipt of the same from the Issuer), registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law. To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof. In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its authenticating 270 ----- agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the d’Wort).

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.46,Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream,21.46.1,,"The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor their respective agents take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters. 271 ----- The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the relevant Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. 272 -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (collectively, “Plans”), and certain duties on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to such Plans. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Plan. A fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in order to determine if the investment satisfies the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and delegation of control. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Plan and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” within the meaning of ERISA or “disqualified persons” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and/or other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code or any Similar Law (as defined below) to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA. Non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) and certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”) (collectively, “Similar Law Plans”). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such law or regulations. Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Guarantors or any other party to the transactions contemplated by this Offering Memorandum or any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser.

The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by a Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding 273 ----- of Notes by a Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such Notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the Plan.

Decree No. 239 regulates the tax treatment of Interest related to bonds or similar securities to the extent they are, _inter alia:_ (A) issued by companies whose shares are listed on a regulated market or on a multi-lateral trading platform of EU Member States and of the States party to the EEA Agreement included in the list provided for by Italian Ministerial Decree dated 4 September 1996, as amended from time to time, or, as from the tax year in which the Ministerial Decree to be issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, let. c) of Decree No. 239 is effective, included in the list therein provided (the “White List”); or 275 ----- (B) listed on a regulated market or on a multilateral trading platform of EU Member States and of the States party to the EEA Agreement included in the White List (C) subscribed, transferred to and held by qualified investors (as defined under Article 100 of the Italian Financial Services Act) only. _Italian resident Noteholders Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_ Where the beneficial owner of the Notes (a “Noteholder”) is an Italian resident and is: (a) an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected (unless he has opted for the application of the risparmio gestito regime—see “—Tax Treatment of Capital Gains”—or he has included the Notes in a long-term savings account—see “Long-term Savings Accounts”—); (b) a partnership (other than a societa` in nome collettivo or societa` in accomandita semplice or similar partnership) or a de facto partnership not carrying out commercial activities (società semplice) or professional association; (c) a non-commercial private or public institution, trusts not carrying out mainly or exclusively commercial activities, the Italian State and public and territorial entities; or (d) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation, then Interest derived from the Notes, and accrued during the relevant holding period, is subject to a withholding tax, referred to as “imposta sostitutiva,” levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or obtained upon disposal of the Notes) unless the relevant Italian Resident Noteholder holds the Notes in a discretionary investment portfolio managed by an authorized intermediary and, under certain conditions, has validly opted for the application of the “Risparmio gestito” regime provided for by Article 7 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (“Decree No. 461”). All the above categories are qualified as “net recipients.” _Noteholders Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_ In the event that the Italian resident Noteholders described under clauses (a) and (c) above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax. Interest will be subject to 26% imposta sostitutiva on a provisional basis and will then be included in the relevant Italian resident noteholder’s annual income tax return. As a consequence, Interest will be subject to the ordinary income tax and imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a credit that can be offset against the income tax due. Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a foreign company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest from the Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva. They must, however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and are therefore subject to the Italian corporate tax (“IRES”) levied at the rate of 24% although certain surcharges may apply) and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, the Italian regional tax on productive activities (“IRAP”) generally levied at the base rate of 3.9%, even though regional surcharges may apply). _Long-term Savings Accounts_ Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are effectively connected or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and No. 103 of February 10, 1996, may be exempt from any income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on Interest if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Article 1 (100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 (“Finance Act 2017”), by Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of 30 December 2018 (“Finance Act 2019”) and, for long-term individual savings accounts established from 1 January 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law Decree No. 124 of 26 October 2019.

However, a withholding or substitute tax 276 ----- of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions and depending on the status and percentage of participation held, income realized by RE Funds and RE SICAFs is attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands irrespective of its actual collection and in proportion to the percentage of ownership of units/shares on a tax transparency basis. _Funds and SICAV and Non-Real Estate SICAFs_ Where an Italian resident Noteholder is an open-ended or closed-ended collective investment fund other than RE Funds (a “Fund”) or Società di Investimento a Capitale Variabile (“SICAV”) or a non-real estate SICAF established in Italy and either (i) the Fund or SICAV or non-real estate SICAF or (ii) its manager is subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest accrued during the holding period on the Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the management results of the Fund, SICAV or non-real estate SICAF. The Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF will not be subject to taxation on such management results, but a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will instead apply in certain circumstances to income realized by certain categories of unitholders or shareholders (as applicable) in case of distribution, redemption or sales of the units or shares. _Pension Funds_ Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by article 17 of the Legislative Decree of 5 December 2005, n. 252) and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to imposta _sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the pension fund accrued at the end of the tax period (which will_ be subject to a 20% substitute tax on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year). Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period) and several limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment), Interest relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the Pension Fund Tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo _termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraphs 100 to 114 of Finance Act 2017, by_ Article 1 (210-215) of Finance Act 2019 as implemented by the Ministerial Decree of April 30, 2019, and, for long-term individual savings account established from 1 January 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law Decree No. 124, as amended and supplemented from time to time. _Enforcement of Imposta Sostitutiva_ Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by Italian resident banks, società di _intermediazione mobiliare (“SIM”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del Risparmio (“SGR”),_ stockbrokers and other entities identified by a decree of the Ministry of Finance or Italian permanent establishment of equivalent foreign entities (each, an “Intermediary”). An Intermediary must: (a) (i) be resident in Italy, or (ii) be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial intermediary, or (iii) be an entity or a company not resident in Italy, acting through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Italian Tax Authorities having appointed an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239; and (b) intervene, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change in Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited. Where the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by the relevant Intermediary paying interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct the suffered imposta sostitutiva from income taxes due.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Decree No. 239 also provides for additional exemptions from the imposta sostitutiva for payments of Interest in respect of the Notes made to: (a) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; (b) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy listed in the White List, and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate self-declaration of being an institutional investor; or (c) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State. In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must be the beneficial owners of the payments of Interest (institutional investors not subject to tax are deemed to be beneficial owners of the payments of Interest by operation of law) and must: (a) deposit in due time, directly or indirectly, the Notes with a resident bank or a SIM or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or a SIM or with a non-Italian resident entity or company participating in a centralized securities management system which is in contact, via computer, with the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance having appointed an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239 (Euroclear and Clearstream are such a depositary); and (b) file with the relevant depository, in due time, a statement of the relevant Noteholder (auto-certificazione), which remains valid until withdrawn or revoked, in which the Noteholder declares to be eligible to benefit from the applicable exemption from imposta sostitutiva.

Failure of a non-resident Noteholder to timely comply with the procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules will result in the application of imposta sostitutiva on Interest payments to a non-resident Noteholder. Noteholders who are subject to the imposta sostitutiva might, nevertheless, be eligible for full or partial relief under an applicable tax treaty between Italy and their country of residence, subject to timely filing of required documentation provided by Measure of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency No. 2013/84404 of 10 July 2013.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Under certain conditions and limitations, noteholders may set off any capital losses with their capital gains. In respect of the application of the substitute tax on capital gains, taxpayers may opt for any of the three regimes described below. _Tax Declaration Regime_ Under the “tax declaration regime” (regime della dichiarazione), which is the default regime for Italian resident individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the 26% substitute tax on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss of the same kind) realized by the Italian resident individual holding the Notes, during any given tax year. Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss of the same kind, in their annual tax return and pay the substitute tax on such gains of the same kind together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four succeeding tax years. _Risparmio Amministrato Regime_ As an alternative to the tax declaration regime, Italian resident individual Noteholders holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may elect to pay the substitute tax separately on capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (risparmio amministrato regime provided for by Article 6 of Decree No. 461). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to: i. the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediaries); and ii. a valid express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being timely made in writing by the relevant Noteholder. The depository is responsible for accounting for the substitute tax in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss. The depository must also pay the substitute tax on capital gains to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting from a sale or redemption of the Notes may be deducted only from capital gains subsequently realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains in the annual tax return. _Risparmio Gestito Regime_ In the risparmio gestito regime, any capital gains realized by Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity and who have entrusted the management of their financial assets (including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary, will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Any depreciation of the managed assets accrued at the tax yearend may be carried forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. The Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains realized in its annual tax return. 279 ----- Subject to certain limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment) and requirements (including a minimum holding period), capital gains in respect of Notes realized upon sale, transfer or redemption by Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may be exempt from any income taxation, including the 26% substitute tax on capital gains, if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) pursuant Article 1, paragraphs 100 – 114, of Finance Act 2017, by Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of Finance Act 2019, and for long-term individual saving accounts established from January 1, 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law Decree No. 124, as amended and supplemented from time to time. _Noteholders Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_ Any capital gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be treated as part of taxable income (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of the production for IRAP purposes) if realized by (i) an Italian company, or a similar commercial entity; (ii) an Italian resident commercial partnership; (iii) an Italian permanent establishment of foreign entities to which the Notes are effectively connected; or, (iv) an Italian resident individual engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected. _RE Funds and RE SICAF_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is an Italian RE Fund or an Italian RE SICAF are exempt from any income tax at the level of the RE Fund or RE SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax will apply in certain circumstances at the rate of 26% to income realized by unitholders or shareholders of the Re Fund/RE SICAF on distributions made by Italian RE Funds/RE SICAF or upon redemption or disposal of the units or the shares (as applicable). Subject to certain conditions and depending on the status and percentage of participation held, income realized by RE Funds and RE SICAFs is attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands, irrespective of its actual collection and in proportion to the percentage of ownership of units on a tax transparency basis. _Funds and SICAV_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is a non-real estate Italian Fund or a non-real estate SICAF or a SICAV will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period which is exempt from any income tax. A 26% withholding tax will apply in certain circumstances, to distributions by the Italian Fund or non-real estate SICAF or SICAV or received by certain categories of unitholders or shareholders upon redemption or disposal or sale of the units or the shares (as applicable). _Pension Funds_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree of 5 December 2005, n. 252) will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to a 20% substitute tax. Subject to certain conditions and requirements (including minimum holding period requirement) and several limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment), income relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the Pension Fund Tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano individuale _di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Article 1 (100-114) of the Finance Act_ 2017, by Article 1 (210-215) of the Finance Act 2019 as implemented by the Ministerial Decree of April 30, 2019, and, for long-term individual savings accounts established from January 1, 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law Decree No. 124, as amended and supplemented from time to time. _Non-Italian Resident Noteholders_ A 26% final substitute tax on capital gains may be payable on capital gains realized upon the sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy. However, pursuant to Article 23, paragraph 1, let. f), of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders, without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets in Italy or abroad are not subject to the substitute tax on capital gains, subject to timely filling of required documentation (in particular, a self-declaration that the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes) with Italian qualified intermediaries (or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) with which the Notes are 280 ----- deposited, even if the Notes are held in Italy and regardless of the provisions set forth by any applicable double tax treaty. Italian tax authorities have recently clarified (Italian Revenue Agency Circular Letter No. 32 of December 23, 2020) that the notion of multilateral trading facility (MTF) under EU Directive 2014/65/CE (so called MiFID II) can be assimilated to that of “regulated market” for income tax purposes; conversely, organized trading facilities (OTF), not falling in the definition of MTF under MiFID II, cannot be assimilated to “regulated market” for income tax purposes. Pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 5 of Decree No. 461, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and held in Italy, even if not traded on regulated markets, are not subject to the substitute tax on capital gains, provided that the effective beneficiary is: (a) resident, for tax purposes, in a State, in a country which recognizes the Italian fiscal authorities’ right to an adequate exchange of information, included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own country of establishment, and does not have a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected; (b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; (c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a country which is listed in the White List, and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate self-declaration of being an institutional investor; or (d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the _risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on_ capital gains will apply upon condition that they file in time with the authorized financial intermediary an appropriate self-declaration – complying with the requirements set forth by the Ministerial Decree of 12 December 2001 – stating that they are resident, for tax purposes, in a country which is listed in the White List. If none of the above conditions above is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets may be subject to the substitute tax at the current rate of 26%. However, non-Italian resident Noteholders might benefit from an applicable tax treaty with Italy providing that capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the tax residence country of the recipient. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the _risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on_ capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-Italian residents file in time with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the competent tax authorities of their country of residence. The risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian resident persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary), but non-Italian resident Noteholders retain the right to waive this regime.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

This was intended to prevent overlap between the EU Savings Tax Directive and the new automatic exchange of information regime to be implemented under Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU). The new regime under Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is in accordance with the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in July 2014. Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is generally broader in scope than the EU Saving Tax Directive, although it does not impose withholding taxes. Italy has enacted Italian Law No. 95 of June 18, 2015 (“Law 95/2015”), implementing the CRS (and the amended EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation) Italian Ministerial Decree dated December 28, 2015, which has entered into force on January 1, 2016, has implemented Law 95/2015 and has provided for the exchange of information starting from the calendar year 2016. In the event that holders of the Notes hold the Notes through an Italian financial institution (as defined in the Italian Ministerial Decree of December 28, 2015 implementing Law 95/2015), they may be required to provide additional information to such financial institution to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Italian implementation of the CRS.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Securities could be included in the scope of application of the FTT if they meet the requirements set out above. On the other hand, securities falling within the category of bonds (obbligazioni), such as the Notes, don’t meet the requirements set out above and, consequently, are not included in the scope of the FTT.

This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder or Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below) and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes. This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the Notes for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation: - U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; - U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents living abroad - persons liable for the alternative minimum tax; - U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment; - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement; - banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions; - real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies; - brokers, dealers or traders in securities; - “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; - S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein); - tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; and - persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note who or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 284 ----- - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and nor or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Notes that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level.

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.1,,25.1.1,,"Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to be entered into in connection with the Notes, the Issuer has agreed to sell the Notes to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Notes from the Issuer. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase all the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the Offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Purchase Agreement will provide that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes for a period of 60 days after the Issue Date. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by brokerdealers who are registered as such under the U.S. Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the commencement of this Offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not it is participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer, and will not effect any offers or sales of any notes in the United States unless it is through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been 289 ----- prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. Each Initial Purchaser has, severally and not jointly, represented and agreed that it will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any “retail investor” in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom. The expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: - a retail client (with respect to the European Economic Area, as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”) and, with respect to the United Kingdom, as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”)); - a customer, with respect to the European Economic Area, within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU, as amended (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II and, with respect to the United Kingdom, within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or - not a “qualified” investor (with respect to the European Economic Area, as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, as amended (the “Prospectus Regulation”) and with respect to the United Kingdom, as defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA). Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit to trading on the Euro MTF Market in accordance with the rules and regulations of that exchange. We cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by applicable law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by law. We cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk _Factors—The interests of the principal shareholder may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes—An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the Notes.”_ 290 ----- We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Initial Purchasers will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. See “Risk _Factors—The interests of the principal shareholder may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes—An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the Notes.”_ The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates or other parties involved in the Acquisition from time to time have provided in the past, are currently providing, or may in the future provide, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking, various lending, hedging, cash management, guarantee or other banking or budgeting services to us and our affiliates under bilateral agreements or local facilities in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may be lenders, managers and/or agents under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Initial Purchasers have also committed to provide bridge financing in connection with the financing of the Multiversity Investment in the event the Offering is not consummated. In connection with these financings, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received and will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates, including the Notes. If the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the Issuer’s securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. 291 -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

(7) It understands that the issuance of Additional Notes under the Indenture may have the effect of extending the Resale Restriction Termination Date. (8) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on the transfer of such Notes. (9) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, any offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. (10) It acknowledges that the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar that the restrictions set out therein have been complied with.

COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time, but is determined for the purposes of decided which court has competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition: moreover, the determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1), second sentence, of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” Under Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation there is, in most cases, a rebuttable presumption that a corporate debtor has its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. The presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the centre of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that Member State have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Recast Insolvency Regulation and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the Recast Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark). If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings that are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. 296 ----- The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings usually become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets). In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer. It remains to be seen what impact the recent vote by the United Kingdom to leave the EU will have on the regulatory environment in the EU and the United Kingdom, and on the applicability of EU law in the United Kingdom. In a “no-deal Brexit” scenario in particular, it may be harder for English office holders and English restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and to effectively deal with assets located in those other Member States. Much depends upon the private international rules in the particular Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular, in cases where the appointment of an English office holder has been made in reliance on an English domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant Member State.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. In light of the above, no Italian company shall undertake to guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred, in full or in part, to purchase its shares and which would therefore constitute the provision of financial assistance 298 ----- within the meaning of Article 2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code and/or any other law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by Italian courts unless in compliance with the limitations and exceptions set forth therein.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding 300 ----- amounts due by such Italian Guarantor to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above. In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by an Italian Guarantor to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests shall be distributed among the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Notes Guarantees and security.

Under such provision (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the security documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are untested by Italian courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral. Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante _comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly_ appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court. Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. 301 -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as _società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The two primary goals of the Italian law are, first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect period. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations—Bankruptcy _proceedings (fallimento)” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become_ unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, guarantees, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; 302 ----- - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the judge; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an 303 ----- indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, inter alia, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act) may not be enforceable; - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/ shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The composizione negoziata della crisi is started by the entrepreneur, on a voluntary basis, with the filing of a petition for the appointment of an independent expert (the “Expert”), through a digital platform (the “Platform”). Together with the petition, the entrepreneur must file the documents listed under Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Law Decree 118/2021, collectively aimed at giving a clear representation of the entrepreneur’s financial status and indebtedness. The Expert is appointed by a three-member commission instituted by the Chamber of Commerce of the main town of each Italian Region, formed by a judge, a member appointed by the Chamber of Commerce’s president and a member appointed by the prefect. The Expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and/or qualifications, undertake a specific training, and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and certain additional requirements aimed at ensuring its independence towards the entrepreneur. 305 ----- The composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore _commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo) which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_ assets, their business and/or their finance such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow, notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy Law are not met. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply to corporate groups. The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the filing of a petition for the appointment of an independent expert (the “Expert”), through a digital platform (the “Platform”). Together with the petition, the enterprises must file the documents listed under Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Law Decree 118/2021, collectively aimed at giving a clear representation of the their financial status and indebtedness. The Expert is appointed by a three-member commission instituted by the Chamber of Commerce of the main city constituting the “capoluogo” of the relevant Italian Region, formed by a judge, a member appointed by the Chamber of Commerce’s president and a member appointed by the prefect. The Expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and/or qualifications, and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and certain additional requirements aimed at ensuring its independence towards the entrepreneur. The Expert assesses his/her independence, the adequacy of his/her professional expertise and his/her time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative outcome, the Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento). The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally, and can be assisted by its counsels. If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. The entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation, and manage his/her assets without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of credit assignment, and/or transfer their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in an informed manner, and the access to the composizione negoziata della crisi does not, by itself, constitute ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply to negotiations involving employment contracts. If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she notifies the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the Chamber of Commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the assignment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any). Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of the Protective Measures. The relevant petition is published in the companies’ register together with the Expert’s acceptance. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) (unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur) and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims. 306 ----- From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures, until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts pending with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. On the same date of the filing of the petition with the companies’ register requesting the application of the Protective Measures, the entrepreneur requests the court to confirm or amend of the Protective Measures, and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures. If the entrepreneur fails to file such petition to the court, the Protective Measures are ineffective. Additionally, if the entrepreneur fails to request the publication of the case number (numero di ruolo generale) assigned by the court within 30 days from the publication of the petition with the companies’ register, the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures is canceled from the companies’ register. Within 10 days from the filing of the petition requesting to confirm or amend the Protective Measures, and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures, the courts schedules a hearing, and upon failure of scheduling such hearing, the Protective Measures become ineffective. At the hearing, the court hears the parties, the Expert and the creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures and the Interim Measures. The court can appoint a court expert and carry out all the relevant investigation measures. The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by a court order in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days. Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations, or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice caused to the creditors that file the relevant request. Pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary and activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery. If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. When Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize: - the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same corporate group to incur new super-senior (prededucibile) indebtedness pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; - the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior (prededucibile) indebtedness pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law via shareholders’ financing; - the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. The Expert may invite the parties to renegotiate in good faith the conditions of certain contracts (other than employment contracts) if, as a consequence of the COVID pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur. If the parties do not agree, the entrepreneur can file a petition asking the court to amend the conditions of such contracts. The court hears the Expert and takes into account the interests of the relevant contractual counterparty, and, if it decides to grant the amendments, ensures the balance between the mutual obligations, if necessary providing for the payment of an indemnity. 307 ----- Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as follow: - execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021 if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such contract ensures the continuation of the business for at least 2 years; - execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; - execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law without the need for the independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided thereby. At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182 bis, Article 182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Alternatively, the entrepreneur may: - arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; - file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio pursuant to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021; - enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the so-called Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure. Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021: - the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione _dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta_ amministrativa),_ extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione _straordinaria) or concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio;_ - the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made; - acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or if the court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021; - payment and transactions, made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio). If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome, and that the options provided under Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file a petition for admission to the concordato _semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under_ Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The petition for concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register by the registry of the court within the day following the filing. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 111, 167, 168 and 169 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply. The court verifies the formal correctness of the proposal, acquires the Expert’s Final Report and an opinion of the Expert on the possible outcome of the liquidation and the relevant guarantees offered thereunder, and (i) appoints 308 ----- a court expert, (ii) gives order to the entrepreneur to notify the proposal, together with the Expert’s Final Report, to the creditors resulting from the list that was attached to the petition for the appointment of the Expert pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Law Decree 118/2021, and (iii) schedules the hearing for the sanctioning (omologazione) of the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio. The court issues a decree sanctioning the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with the statutory priority and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. Apart from the Law Decree 118/2021 and the Insolvency Code, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian Bankruptcy Law (the “Decree”). The Decree entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, entered into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. In addition to the composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio described above, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are available under Italian_ law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. The amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, which anticipate certain provisions of the Insolvency Code, will be examined in the following sections.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the 309 ----- truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors’ proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors proceeding or a debt restructuring agreement.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-adhering creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-adhering creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-adhering creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to preexisting debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. 310 ----- The Italian Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di _ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._ The new Article 182 bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. If substantial amendments are made to the plan prior to the court’s sanctioning (omologazione), (i) the independent expert carries out a new assessment on the truthfulness of the business and accounting data, the feasibility of the agreement and its attitude to allow payment of the non-adhering creditors within the terms provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and (ii) the debtor requests the creditors to confirm their adherence to the debt restructuring agreement. The independent expert carries out a new assessment also in case of substantial amendments to the agreement. If substantial amendments to the plan become necessary after to the court’s sanctioning (omologazione), the debtor amends the plan in order to ensure the performance of the obligations provided under the debt restructuring agreement, and requests the independent expert to carry out a new assessment. In this case, the new plan and the new assessment of the independent expert are published in the companies’ register and notice of such publication is given to the creditors by means of certified mail or certified email. Creditors may oppose the new plan within 30 days from the notice of the publication Pursuant to Article 182, Paragraph 4, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by the Law Decree 118/2021, the court can sanction the debt restructuring agreement also if the Italian Tax Authority or the Italian Social Security Authority do not adhere, provided that their adherence is essential in order to reach the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and that the claims of the non-adhering Italian Tax Authority and Italian Social Security Authority are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the debt restructuring agreement than as what would be the case in bankruptcy. The adherence of the Italian Tax Authority and of the Italian Social Security Authority must occur within 90 days from the filing of the debt restructuring agreement proposal. Pursuant to the new Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is reduced to the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) does not previously file a petition for admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182-octies, Article 182-novies and Article 182-decies, thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Insolvency Code. Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements by obtaining approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a so-called “cram-down”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-adhering creditors are not treated worse than under any effectively available alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa). If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-adhering creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the agreement and refuse to be forced into it. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi. Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries and have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-adhering creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect for the continuation of the business activity as a going concern. 311 ----- Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind non-adhering creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and _(iii) the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the_ recovery strategies undertaken by the debtor and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations and have been kept informed). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the standstill agreement provided under Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-adhering creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182 decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-adhering creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors. Moreover, pursuant to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. The aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to Article 182 quinquies, Paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182- bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called _prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_ debtor, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the debtor. 312 -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato _preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the_ date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfil, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. 313 ----- Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business, pending the _concordato in bianco, as well as the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to_ Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, are treated as super-senior (so called _prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security_ interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the business continues to be run by the debtor as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge. The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior judge’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The concordato preventivo is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided that they receive, at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets, as assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy courtsupervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposal with 314 ----- liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and sanctioned (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti _preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_ application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid according to the concordato preventivo proposal. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_ had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be 315 ----- considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore _fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and_ sets forth the relevant timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration is suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a designated judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian Tax Authority, and judicial and social security authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual agreements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors or third parties starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato _passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to_ the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction, in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their claim affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims that benefit from preferential treatment, which include creditors who hold a security interest (creditori ipotecari o pignoratizi) and creditors who have a preference under law (creditori privilegiati in senso stretto); and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. 316 ----- - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or of the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - **Acts ineffective by operation of law (1) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (2) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been postponed to September 1, 2021 by the Law Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020 (as converted by Law No. 40 of June 5, 2020) and is now scheduled for May 16, 2022, except for the section named Parte Prima-Titolo II (i.e., the new preventive alert and mediation phase), which will entry into force on December 31, 2023, pursuant to Article 1 of the Law Decree No. 118 dated August 24, 2021 (the “Law Decree 118/2021”), published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale No. 202 of August 24, 2021. Law Decree 118/2021 needs to be converted in law within 60 days from its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale, otherwise it will cease to be effective; in the context of the conversion process changes and amendments—which cannot be foreseen—may be included and impact the above new provisions. The main innovations of the Law Decree 118/2021 are the following: (i). additional postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code; (ii). introduction of a new a negotiated composition proceeding (composizione negoziata della crisi) and of a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato _semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio);_ (iii). amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which anticipate certain provisions of the Insolvency Code. The postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code, and the amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law, are effective as of August 25, 2021 (i.e., the day following the publication of the Law Decree 118/2021 in the Gazzetta Ufficiale), while the composizione negoziata della crisi and the concordato semplificato per la _liquidazione del patrimonio are effective as of November 15, 2021. Accordingly, the practical consequences of_ the implementation of such reforms cannot to date be foreseen in their entirety. The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021 requesting the court to confirm or modify the protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if necessary, to enact the interim measures necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures”), and",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario 318 ----- _giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization._ The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within 10 days from such filing, the Ministry of the Economic Development (the “Ministry”) may release an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration proceeding. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt. If the Disposal Plan is approved, the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate claw-back actions according to the avoidance provisions set forth with respect to bankruptcy proceedings. If acts such as those that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver (see above) are put in place among companies belonging to the same group, the claw-back period is extended to up to three or five years.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the judicial phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. Unlike in the Prodi-bis procedure, in the Marzano procedure the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate claw-back actions also if a Recovery Plan is approved, provided that this results in a material benefit for the creditors.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is a special sort of insolvency proceeding in which the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court, but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di _sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency_ proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during the suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Notes Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the security documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant security documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency.

In certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code provided for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.1,,215.1.1,,"_The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Italy. The documents relating to the Collateral will be governed by the laws of Italy and any jurisdiction where the Collateral is located. The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees (if any) will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by the laws of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States. Because substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its and their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions (including Italy) upon those persons or the Issuer provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which the Issuer is located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States._ Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgments obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato), among others, the following conditions are met: - the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law principles of jurisdiction; - the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been violated; - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of defendant party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law; - the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law; - there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court; - there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which commenced prior to the action in the United States; and - the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico). In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by a U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set out above. In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. If an original action is brought before an Italian court, the Italian court may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory provisions of Italian law. 321 -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Multiversity Group is leader in undergraduate and postgraduate online education business in Italy (e-learning), with a clear mission: to be enablers and accelerators of progress with greater access to quality training for citizens and companies; to create digital citizens, start uppers, innovators, successful professionals, 4.0 managers, P.A. managers, students with projects to develop. Innovating alongside the entrepreneurial and managerial context of companies. This mission is pursued through a flexible model of delivery of educational content that allows greater opportunities for access to study and the acquisition of new skills with the aim of reducing social inequalities through an extremely advanced and innovative technology platform. The mission is in line with main sustainable development goals of Agenda 2030 of EU. The Group’s vision is to consolidate its position and become the first On-line Education Group on both Italian and International markets, to provide training at any time and from any place with attention to both B2C and B2B: Smart learning for an increasingly wide audience of students. More specifically, the Group includes among its main activities: - Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l., Universitas Mercatorum, Pegaso International Ltd., able to guarantee the individual student maximum educational and professional mobility, through interchangeable degree courses in different languages and exam centers present in all continents; - English language training and B2 level certifications (officially recognised as established by the Italian Ministerial Decree n. 353 dated May 23, 2014); - training of IT skills and EIPASS certifications at an international level; - the establishment of online academies, as a training tool capable of combining the learning of multilevel skills (hard skills and soft skills) with the acquisition of technical-operational procedures borrowed from the best practices of companies and testimonials of excellence. In this context, the Group signed new significant agreements during the first half of 2021; - the promotion, through the subsidiary Giapeto publishing house, of initiatives carried out by its students and the dissemination of experience gained in the scientific research sectors of the Group, in particular, that of the humanities and legal sciences, thus capitalising on the progress of skills; - the launch of the first gastronomic university and centre for higher education and university specialisation dedicated entirely to gastronomy and tourism. Principe di Napoli is the only national campus of excellence in its sector; - the Benecon research centre, in which last year a further important investment was made to consolidate the centrality of the research activities of the Group and the attention to environmental sustainability issues through an advanced proprietary marine and terrestrial detection technology, thanks to a proprietary aircraft and the re-processing of data with data analytics software. In summary, this research centre represents the application and practical responses to sustainability issues and the objectives set by the EU 2030 agenda. F-9 ----- Among the Multiversity Group is necessary to point out the Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l., established by Ministerial Decree of April 20, 2006 (GU No. 118 of 23-5-2006—Ordinary Suppl. No. 125), which represents one of the Italian universities with the most modern and effective technological standards in e-learning, with modern educational systems and methodologies to respond to the different needs of today’s society. The study courses provide a high degree of independence and personalization of the educational path and they are free of any constraint of physical presence, even if constantly tracked, following the student and at the same time monitoring the continuous level of learning (also through frequent moments of evaluation and self-evaluation). The Group’s Universities use innovative, native, telematic technologies and adopt a system architecture capable of managing and making high quality online university courses accessible to the student. The educational support specialists who work alongside the teachers (tutors, mentors and coaches) assist the learner throughout the entire course of study, in order to achieve a perfect balance of learning based on the affirmation of one’s potential, off highly technological and interactive tools, TV learning and social learning that involve the student in a truly unique and effective educational experience. The academic titles issued at the end of the study courses have the same legal value as the titles issued by traditional universities. _Business outlook_ In relation to the current trend and future prospects, also based on the evolution of the number of enrolments in progress at the universities of the Multiversity Group, as well as the interesting projects in progress, the Group foresees a further increase in prospective revenue and investments. Considering the development of the current training offer and the growing trend in enrolments at our Universities, a further significant growth in ordinary revenues is expected for the second half of 2021 and, consequently, this growth could inject further impulse to new investments in educational, training and research projects. New degree courses will be offered starting from the AA 2021/2022, which will further boost revenue growth, specifically “Philosophy”, “Statistics and Big Data” and “Infrastructure engineering for a sustainable mobility”. Monitoring of operational activities is continuing in the light of regulatory and health developments. Therefore, the Multiversity Group universities will continue to apply smart working, in order to ensure full safety for workers and at the same time the full continuation of activities. The model and structure adopted by these universities have been resilient in the face of the current crisis, also thanks to the strong capability to react of the entire operational structure. The Multiversity Group is at the forefront, especially against the backdrop of significant fragility of the social fabric and the risks associated with the pandemic, to guarantee its students the execution of courses and the availability of taking online exams, the first online university to offer this option. We believe increasingly more firmly in the social mission of our universities and in the importance of online training as a tool for accelerating social progress in our country, also in the light of the new paradigms imposed by the pandemic. We will continue to monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic and social context and take any necessary steps in order to better respond to the needs of the market and our students. _Other information_ The Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. is not subject to management and coordination activities pursuant to art. 2497 of the Italian Civil Code.

F-10 ----- Finally, income taxes are recognized based on the best estimate of the weighted average rate expected for the entire fiscal year. There were no exceptional circumstances, incompatible with the general clause of clear, true and fair representation, pursuant to art. 2423, paragraph 5 of the Italian Civil Code that made it necessary to depart from legal provisions regarding preparation of the Unaudited Interim Condensed consolidated financial statements. In compliance with accounting standard OIC 29, no correction has been made in the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for material errors committed in previous years. Subsidiary companies are excluded from consolidation when their inclusion would be immaterial for the purposes of presenting clearly and fairly the financial position and results of operations of the Group (article 28, paragraph 2, letter a of Legislative Decree 127/1991). There were no changes during the period in the consolidation perimeter. The table below shows the companies included in the consolidation perimeter as at June 30, 2021, together with the stake percentage held and the consolidation method applied. The table below shows the list of companies included in the consolidated financial statements using the line-by-line, proportional or equity method: _Research and Development costs and Other Multi-Year Charges with future utility_ Research and development costs, as well as other multi-year charges with future utility, have been capitalized at the end of the interim period only if there is a reasonable certainty that all the necessary requirements for their inclusion among intangible assets have been met and properly defined. Otherwise, these costs have been charged to the Income Statement for the interim period, although provision has been made for the capitalization of the above-mentioned costs at the end of the fiscal year if the above-mentioned requirements are met. _Depreciation of intangibles and fixed assets_ Depreciation of intangibles and fixed assets was carried out only in relation to assets that are available and ready for use during the six-month period under review, using the annual rate suitably reduced in proportion to the duration of the six-month period. No depreciation was calculated based on acquisitions and disposals planned during the period. _Write-down of assets recorded in the Balance Sheet_ Write-downs of assets recorded in the Balance Sheet were only carried out if, at the end of the six-month period under review, there is reasonable certainty that all the necessary requirements for carrying out the write-down have been met. Otherwise, these assets will be written down at the end of the fiscal year if the above requirements are met. _Taxes for the period_ The tax burden was commensurate with gross income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, by using the effective annual tax rate, i.e., the rate expected at the end of the fiscal year. In accordance with article 2426, paragraph 1, no. 8-bis of the Italian Civil Code, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency used to present the financial statements (the so-called “reporting currency”) are recorded at the spot exchange rate at the end of the period, following initial recognition. Any resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are recorded in the Income Statement under item C17-bis) “foreign exchange gains and losses” and any net gain, which is included in the profit for the period, is allocated to a specific reserve that cannot be distributed until it is realized. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the accounting currency are recorded at the exchange rate in force at the time of purchase. Should the exchange rate at the end of the period differ significantly from that at the date of acquisition, the change in exchange rate is one of the elements taken into consideration in the valuation process to determine the value that can be posted to the financial statements for individual non-monetary assets. In this case, therefore, any exchange rate differences (positive or negative) are included in the determination of the recoverable value. With regard to Intangible assets, the following is specified. - Start-up, expansion and development costs, amounting to Euro 36,112 as of June 30, 2021, include the costs incurred by the Group in the phase of incorporation of the various companies included in the perimeter. - Industrial parents and intellectual property rights, amounting to Euro 29,905,896 as at June 30, 2021, mainly include assets forming part of the intangible assets of Multiversity S.r.l., (mainly the trademarks “Pegaso” and “Eipass”) amounting to Euro 29,014,718 and other patent rights owned by Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l., Universitas Mercatorum, Certipass S.r.l. and Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l. amounting to Euro 891,178. The increase due to acquisitions amount is mainly due to the Universitas Mercatorum copyright bought during the year and related to the video classes subsequently provided to the students. - Concessions, licences, trademarks and similar rights, amounting to Euro 1,446,913 as of June 30, 2021, mainly include software licences and other concessions held by the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. and by the universities of the Group. - Goodwill, amounting to € 525,295,768, net of amortisation for the half-year calculated over a useful life of 20 years and for an amount of € 14,410,421 as of June 30, 2021 refers to the two cash generating units identified by the Multiversity Group at the time of the first consolidation on December 31, 2019 (specifically Pegaso for an initial amount of € 565,975,154 and Universitas Mercatorum for an initial amount of € 4,423,846). - Other intangible assets, amounting to € 2,098,190 as of June 30, 2021, mainly include the following: - multi-year indemnities for non-competition towards third parties for € 979,469; - renovation and improvement work of Universities premises charges for € 616,623; - other charges for multi-year use. for € 401,869.

In addition, the item includes receivables deriving from the sale of training courses and EICARDs for € 354,710. The nominal amounts are recognised net of the related bad debt provision. Tax receivables, amounting to € 7,501,579, mainly include the receivables due from the tax authorities following the payment of advances relating to the respective income taxes. The increase of the period is due to the indirect tax advances paid by Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. and Universitas Mercatorum in April 2021. Deferred tax assets, equal to € 236,713, include taxes paid in advance that will be reasonably recovered in subsequent years. The item receivables due from others, equal to € 1,743,561 mainly includes: - rent expense—advances amounting to € 1,056,144 relating to the headquarters of the subsidiary Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. in Naples, Piazza Trieste and Trento. It should be noted that the payment plan will be completed by December 31, 2024 and that property is placed at the disposal of the University on the basis of the lease contract in place; - the residual balance of € 687,417 includes receivables for advances to employees, professionals and suppliers. The Group operates almost entirely in the national domain. Consequently, almost all of the receivables recorded under current assets refer to this geographical area, except for € 460,063 in the territory of Malta. The provision for tax risks for a total of € 130,717 underwent during the first half of 2021 a change due to the use of an amount equal to € 7,512 made by Certipass S.r.l., in relation to the report on findings notified in October 2020 by the Italian Tax Agency and concerning the Research & Development tax credit related to the years 2015 and 2016.

The inspection and document acquisition activities by the Revenue Agency are still in progress and, thanks to the support of the tax advisors in charge, the Group is promptly responding to the requests and questions raised. At the state of the proceedings, no objection has been made by the inspectors nor has the report of findings been drawn up yet. Tax payables, equal to € 50,414,044, mainly include the payable relating to IRES of current period and the balance of last year, VAT and IRAP taxes, as well as the payable for withholding taxes related to self-employed work and the salaries of employees of Group companies. Furthermore, this item also includes the stamp duty payable to be paid virtually. The variation of the period, amounting to € 24.008.576, is due to the accounting of the income taxes of the period. Payables to welfare and social security institutions, amounting to € 826,335, includes payables relating to mandatory contributions accrued and not yet paid to social security and welfare institutions. The decrease of the period, amounting to € 251,858, is due to the higher provisions (i.e. 13th month-pay on a pro-tempore basis) accounted on December 31, 2020. Payables to others, amounting to € 5,054,469, mainly include payables to employees of Group companies for wages and holidays to be paid to their employees. The Group operates almost entirely in the national territory. Consequently, almost all of the payables refer to this geographical area, except for € 352,247 in the territory of Malta.

The substance of each transaction or action, i.e. each corporate event, was therefore identified, regardless of its origin, and an assessment made of the relationships between the various agreements that form part of complex transactions. The profits indicated in the Consolidated Financial Statements are exclusively those made at the end of the reporting periods. The revenue and expenses shown are those pertaining to the financial half-year, regardless of the date of collection or payment. Risks and losses pertaining to the financial year were taken into account, even if known after the end of the reporting period. The miscellaneous elements included in the individual items are valued and recognized separately. Pursuant to article 2423-ter, par. 5, of the Italian Civil Code, regarding the comparability of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, it should be noted that the previous year’s end figure is also shown for each item in the balance sheet while the corresponding period of the previous half-year for each item is shown in the income statement and cash flow statement. If the items are not comparable, the previous years’ figures are adjusted accordingly and an explanation of the reason why they are not comparable and their adjustment (or the reasons why it is not possible to adjust them) is given in these notes to the financial statements. Pursuant to article 2423-ter, para. 2 of the Italian Civil Code, items preceded by Arabic numerals may be broken down further, without eliminating the overall item and corresponding amount; these may only be grouped if, due to their amount, the grouping does not affect the true and fair view of the Company’s financial and economic position and the profit or loss for the period, or if it makes the financial statements clearer. In the latter case, the note contains all the items in the group separately. In these notes to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the information on items of the balance sheet and associated income statement items are presented in the order in which the relevant items are shown in the balance sheet and the income statement pursuant to Article 2427, para. 2 of the Italian Civil Code. The accounting standards adopted in the preparation of these Unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are the same as those used for the Group Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended on December 31, 2020, therefore no change or adoption of new accounting standards is reported in the preparation of this document. For a detailed explanation of the accounting standards applied in the preparation of these explanatory notes and the contents of the items in the financial statements, reference should be made to the Basis of preparation included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020. The preparation of these Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may require the application of accounting methods that, in certain circumstances, are based on subjective assumptions and valuations, based on historical experience, the reasonableness of which is verified from time to time on the basis of the relevant circumstances. The application of these estimates and assumptions impacted the amounts reported in the financial statements, as well as the information provided in these explanatory notes. The results of the estimations may be different from those shown in the year-end financial statements, due to the uncertainty that characterizes the assumptions and the conditions on which the estimates were based. The valuations made are periodically reviewed and the effects of any changes are reflected in the income statement if they concern that period. If the adjustment affects both current and future periods, the change is posted in the period in which the revision is made and in the related future periods. Certain valuation processes, in particular the determination of any impairment of assets, are generally only carried out in full at the time of preparing the annual financial statements, when all necessary information is available, except of cases where there are indicators that require an immediate assessment.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. _Share base payments and year-end bonuses_ The Multiversity S.r.l. shareholders meeting held on June 25, 2021, approved a non-proportional share capital increase by nominal € 1,000 in favour of some key managers of the Group, who have been assigned the option rights to subscribe the capital increase once some relevant conditions are met. Taken into consideration that the key conditions are not met at the date of the preparation of the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the share capital was not subscribed. In accordance with Italian GAAP, the Group did not account for any estimate on the fair value of this share based payment transaction. The key managers of the Group, as approved by the Board of Directors meeting held in February 2021, are recognized with a bonus if some key parameters, in terms of Group economic performance and individual once are met, based on financial figures as at December 31, 2021.

For this purpose, subsidiaries are the following: - entities in which another company holds the majority of votes that can be exercised at the ordinary shareholders’ meeting; - entities in which another company has enough votes to exercise a dominant influence at the ordinary shareholders’ meeting; In any case, the following are considered subsidiaries: - companies over which another has the right, by virtue of a contract or a clause in the articles of association, to exercise a dominant influence, when the applicable law permits such contracts or clauses; - companies in which another, based on agreements with other shareholders, alone controls the majority of voting rights.

The consolidation principles adopted for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows: - the financial statements of the subsidiaries included in the consolidation area have been consolidated using the line-by-line method, which consists of the assumption of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses in their total amount, regardless of the size of the shareholding held and the attribution to third-party shareholders, in the items ‘Capital and reserves pertaining to minority interests’ and ‘Profit/(Loss) for the year attributable to minority interests’, respectively, of the portion of shareholders’ equity and profit/loss for the year pertaining to them. - the financial statements of the companies in which the Parent Company holds joint control are consolidated by applying the proportional consolidation method, which provides for the proportional inclusion in the consolidated financial statements of the assets, liabilities, costs, revenues and cash flows of the companies over which it exercises joint control with shareholders not belonging to the group, considering only the part of their value corresponding to the interest held directly or indirectly by the parent company. - The financial statements of associated companies are valued by applying the equity method, with which the original cost of the investment changes in the periods following the acquisition of the investment to take into account the pertinent shares of profits and losses and other changes in the shareholders’ equity of the investee.

This document sets out the economic and financial data of a fiscal year characterised by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, an epidemic which has spread throughout the globe, and is still in progress. However, this did not have any adverse effects on the profit for the year and on the consolidation of corporate assets, due to the positive results achieved by the companies owned by the Multiversity Group. The provisions of art. 106 of Legislative Decree no. 18/2020 on holding via video-conference as well as electronic voting apply to the shareholders’ meetings, in order to guarantee remote participation in the context of the epidemiological emergency stemming from COVID-19.

In relation to the content of the explanatory notes pursuant to art. 2427 of the Italian Civil Code, the Group: - has not issued any bonds and/or similar financial instruments; - did not carry out any financing transactions with the temporary sale of assets during the 2020 fiscal year; - has not carried out any asset lending transactions against a security deposit of a sum of money; - has no off-balance sheet agreements in place other than those reported in both these Explanatory Notes and in the Report on Operations, knowledge of which is useful for evaluating the equity and financial situation of the company; - has not carried out any atypical or unusual transactions, or transactions that are unrelated to the normal management of the company or capable of significantly affecting the Group’s economic and equity situation; - has not issued any shares with regular dividend entitlement and bonds convertible into shares, or securities or similar instruments pursuant to art. 2427, first paragraph, no. 18 of the Italian Civil Code - does not have any separate assets dedicated to specific business or any special-purpose loans pursuant to art. 2447 bis et seq. of the Italian Civil Code.

For the elements of the assets or liabilities that fall under more than one item of the financial statements, the explanatory notes also outline whether they belong to the items other than those in which they are recorded, if this is necessary for the purposes of understanding the financial statements. Where applicable, the principles and recommendations published by the professional bodies responsible for accounting were also observed, in order to give a true and fair view of the equity, financial and economic situation. The Parent Company was established on October 1, 2019, with a share capital of € 100,000 fully subscribed by Multiversity S.p.A., with effect from October 4, 2019, the date of registration in the Register of Companies. The Multiversity Group is the market leader in online university and postgraduate training in Italy (E-Learning), with a clear mission: - be enablers and accelerators of progress with greater access to quality training for citizens and companies; - create digital citizens, startuppers, innovators, successful professionals, 4.0 managers, PA executives, students with projects to be developed. Innovating alongside the entrepreneurial and managerial fabric of companies. This mission is pursued through a flexible model of teaching content delivery that allows greater opportunities for access to study, the acquisition of new skills with the aim of reducing social inequalities through an extremely advanced and innovative technology platform. The Group’s Vision is to consolidate its position and become the first On-line Education Group on both the Italian and international market with the possibility of providing training at any time and from any place with attention to both B2C and B2B: Smart learning for an ever wider audience of students. On July 22, 2020 LAF School S.r.l. was established, of which Multiversity S.r.l. represents the majority shareholder (51% of the share capital). LAF School S.r.l. manages a digital educational platform that aims to create a school that is more accessible to everyone, making it more participatory, through the management of one’s school career through an app that can be managed on smartphones, PCs and tablets. Furthermore, it is recalled that during the 2020 fiscal year the acquisition of control of the investment in the Benecon S.c.a.r.l. University Consortium took place, through the company Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l., which represents the majority shareholder, having acquired 63% of the share capital. The Benecon S.c.a.r.l university consortium is made up of five Italian universities (University of Campania ‘Luigi Vanvitelli’, University of Naples ‘Federico II’, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. (Pegaso Online University), University of Salerno and University of Sannio), excellence in research at national and international level with the aim of carrying out analysis and diagnosis of the local area, environmental redevelopment, recovery and maintenance of landscape, archaeological, urban and building contexts which, among others, designs and builds ‘green businesses’ and eco-museum structures. It should be noted that the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. is not subject to management and coordination activities pursuant to art. 2497 of the Italian Civil Code. Specifically, the Company is subject to the joint control of the two shareholders Multiversity S.p.A. and Paganini Investments S.a.r.l. Furthermore, it should be noted that the shareholders’ meeting on November 4, 2019 appointed the auditing company EY S.p.A. as statutory audititors of the separate financial statements and consolidated financial statements of Multiversity S.r.l. for the three-year period 2019/2021. F-34 ----- The table below shows the list of companies included in the consolidated financial statements using the line-by-line, proportional or equity method: - The book value of equity investments consolidated using the line-by-line method was eliminated against the corresponding portions of shareholders’ equity, less the result for the year, at the date of first inclusion in the consolidation (taking into account what is specified in the next point). The difference between the acquisition cost and the shareholders’ equity at fair value of the subsidiaries at the consolidation date is allocated, where possible, to the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries net of deferred taxes, where applicable; any remaining difference, if positive and if the requirements for recording goodwill provided for by OIC 24 are met, is recognised in the item “Goodwill” within intangible assets. The residual difference that cannot be allocated to assets and liabilities and to goodwill is charged to the income statement under the “item B14 Other operating expenses”. - As regards the date relating to the first inclusion in the scope of consolidation, reference is made to January 1st, 2020 where the acquisition of control took place in the first months of the year and the economic effects are in any case not significant. - Goodwill is amortised on the basis of an economic utility estimated according to its useful life, taking into account all the information available to determine the period in which the economic benefits will arise, in exceptional cases in which it is not possible to reliably estimate their life, it is amortised over a period not exceeding twenty years. - If an excess of shareholders’ equity is recognised over the acquisition cost, after having reduced, if necessary, the values of the assets recorded to their recoverable value and of the liabilities recognised to a value lower than their settlement value, net of prepaid taxes and having established the ‘Consolidation provision for future risks and charges’ against estimated liabilities, this would be credited to the consolidated shareholders’ equity under the item ‘Consolidation reserve’. The portion of shareholders’ equity attributable to minority interests of the consolidated subsidiaries is entered under the item ‘Capital and reserves pertaining to minority interests’ of the shareholders’ equity, while the minority interests’ share of the net result is shown separately in the consolidated income statement under the item “Profit/(loss) of pertaining to minority interests”. - The credit and debit items between the companies included in the consolidation have been eliminated. - The income and charges relating to transactions between the companies included in the consolidation, starting from the first consolidation, have been eliminated. - Significant profits and losses deriving from transactions between companies included in the consolidation relating to values still included in the balance sheet at the end of the year have been eliminated. - Dividends distributed within the group were reversed from the consolidated income statement. - The conversion into Euro of financial statements expressed in foreign currencies (if applicable) is carried out using the ‘current exchange rate’ method. The historical exchange rate at the date of first consolidation is used for the items of the shareholders’ equity, the year-end exchange rate for the assets and liabilities of the balance sheet and the average exchange rate for those of the income statement. Any foreign exchange translation differences are charged directly to shareholders’ equity in the specific item ‘Translation reserve’. - The differences deriving from the elimination of intra-group payables, receivables, costs and revenues in foreign currencies have been recorded under item ‘17-bis) Exchange gains and losses’. The amortization rates used are summarised in the following table: The value of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the amounts received, both by way of principal and interest, as well as for any write-downs to bring the receivables back to their presumed realisable value or for losses. The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and the discounting back are not relevant when the maturity of the receivables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and substantial considerations in place on recognition of the receivable, and the transaction costs and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity is of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting was omitted, the interest was calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs were entered among deferrals and amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the receivable to adjust the nominal interest income. Financial payables originating from financing transactions and payables arising for reasons other than the acquisition of goods and services are recognised when the company has an obligation towards the counterparty, identified in compliance of legal and contractual regulations. On the other hand, advances received from customers for supplies of goods or services not yet carried out are included in the item advances. Payables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, considering the time factor. If the interest rate of the transaction is not significantly different from the market rate, the payable is initially recognised at a value equal to the nominal value, net of all transaction costs and all premiums, discounts and rebate deriving directly from the transaction that generated the payable. These transaction costs, such as ancillary expenses for obtaining loans, any commission income and expenses and any difference between the initial value and nominal value at maturity, are spread over the duration of the debt using the effective interest criterion. When it appears that the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly different from the market rate, the payable (and the corresponding cost in the case of commercial transactions) is initially recognised at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows and taking into account any transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate. In the case of payables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value of the payable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as a financial charge over the duration of the payable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial payables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest expense accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with the value of the payable as a contra entry. The value of the payables is subsequently reduced by the amounts paid, both as principal and interest. The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and the discounting back are not relevant when the due date is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and substantial considerations in place when the payable is recognised, and the transaction costs and any difference between the initial value and nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting is omitted and the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered among deferrals and amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the payable to adjust the nominal interest expense. The provision for sundry risks includes an estimate of the potential risks relating to some assets relating to Certipass S.r.l. The provision for tax risks includes, net of some reclassifications made by Universitas Mercatorum amounting to € 206,874, the accruals of € 99,867 made during the year by Certipass S.r.l. regarding the Report on Findings notified by the Revenue Agency on October 26, 2020 regarding the Research & Development tax credit relating to the years 2015 and 2016. The amount set aside includes penalties and interest. The item payables to others, equal to € 4,631,874, mainly includes payables to employees of Group companies for wages and holidays to be paid to their employees. The area in which the Group operates is almost entirely national, consequently all payables refer to this geographical area. evaluation team equal to roughly € 1.37 million, technical, legal and administrative consultancy for an amount of approximately € 845 thousand, insurance and bank charges of amounting to around € 1.13 million and other services connected with the operational management of the various Group companies. S.r.l. agreed a settlement with the main E-learning Centre Points, which provides for the consensual termination of the agreements in place effective from January 1st, 2020, based on the payment of a total amount of € 4 million, in the form of compensation, and a total consideration of roughly € 16,600 per month, plus VAT, for the entire five-year duration of a series of obligations undertaken by E-learning Centre Points, including the obligation of not undertaking activities in competition with those of the university mentioned previously. Effects on the income statement (in thousands of Euro): highly critical position in comparison with most of European countries, and also allows the possibility of creating multidisciplinary paths and focusing on the enhancement and support of that training potential which, put to good use, constitutes the driving force for the country’s longed-for social growth. On February 2, 2021, Ministerial Decree 133 was issued (Amendment of the guidelines attached to Ministerial Decree no. 386/2007—Flexibility of study courses) aimed at universities. In order ‘to enhance the university autonomy in determining the educational systems of the study courses with regard to similar or supplementary training activities and to allow greater flexibility in the determination of the training courses’, it is established that: the university institutions, in the their autonomy, define the related or supplementary activities, referred to in art. 10, paragraph 5, of the regulation adopted with decree no. 270 of October 22, 2004, in the educational regulations of the course of study, in line with the objectives of the training course. In the educational system, only the total credits assigned to these activities are indicated. All training activities relating to scientific-disciplinary sectors not envisaged for basic and specialised activities can be part of the similar or supplementary activities, as defined by the ministerial decrees determining the degree classes and master’s degree classes, which ensure a multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary training of the student. The related and supplementary training activities can be organised in the form of teaching courses, laboratories, exercises, seminars or other activities as long as they are aimed at acquiring knowledge and skills functionally related to the cultural and professional profile identified by the course of study. Ministerial Decree 289/2020 was published on March 25, 2021 concerning the GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR THE PROGRAMMING OF UNIVERSITIES 2021-2023 and INDICATORS FOR THE PERIODIC EVALUATION OF THE RESULTS for which the definition of new indicators is expected for the initial and periodic accreditation of university offices and courses by of ANVUR.

For this purpose, the following are considered subsidiaries: - companies in which another company holds most of the votes that can be exercised at the ordinary shareholders’ meeting; - companies in which another company has enough votes to exercise a dominant influence in the ordinary shareholders’ meeting; In any case, the following are considered subsidiaries: - companies over which another has the right, by virtue of a contract or a statutory clause, to exercise a dominant influence, when the applicable law allows such contracts or clauses; - companies in which another, on the basis of agreements with other shareholders, alone controls the majority of the voting rights. The equity investments in which the Parent Company holds joint control are also consolidated by applying the proportional method. Equity investments in associated companies were measured by applying the equity method _(so-called synthetic consolidation)._ Subsidiaries are excluded from line-by-line consolidation when their inclusion would be irrelevant for the purposes of representing clearly and in a true and fair manner the equity and financial situation and the economic result of the group (art. 28, paragraph 2, letter a of Legislative Decree 127/1991).

In the absence of indicators of potential impairment, the recoverable value is not determined. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and its value in use determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows. An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value. When, subsequently, a loss on assets, other than goodwill, ceases or is reduced, the book value of the asset or the cash-generating unit is increased up to the new estimate of the recoverable value without exceeding the value that would have been determined if no loss had been detected.

Impairment is determined by comparing the book value of the investment with its recoverable value, based on the future benefits that are expected to flow into the investee’s economy. Impairment is permanent when, justifiably, the causes of said impairment are not expected to be eliminated in a short period of time, i.e. in a period so short as to make it possible to formulate reliable forecasts based on objective and reasonably verifiable facts. If, on the other hand, the investee has prepared plans and programmes aimed at restoring the conditions of economic-financial equilibrium, with characteristics as such to justify the belief that the impairment of the investment is temporary, this can be defined as non-permanent.

Receivables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, taking into account the time factor, and within the limits of their presumed realisable value and, therefore, are shown in the balance sheet net of the related bad debt provision deemed adequate to cover losses due to reasonably foreseeable non-collectability. If the interest rate of the transaction is not significantly different from the market rate, the receivable is initially recorded at a value equal to the nominal value net of all premiums, discounts, rebates and inclusive of any costs directly attributable to the transaction, which generated the receivable. These transaction costs, any commission income and expense and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are spread over the duration of the loan using the effective interest criterion. On the other hand, when the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly different from the market rate, the receivable (and the corresponding revenue in the case of commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows plus any transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate. In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value of the receivable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as financial income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest income accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with the value of the receivable as a contra entry.

The consequent gains or losses on foreign exchange are recognised in the income statement under item C17-bis) ‘foreign exchange gains and losses’ and any net profit, which contributes to the formation of the operating result, is set aside in a specific reserve that cannot be distributed until realised. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the accounting currency are recognised at the exchange rate in effect at the time of their acquisition. If the exchange rate in force at the closing date of the fiscal year is significantly different from that existing at the acquisition date, the exchange rate variation is one of the elements taken into consideration in the valuation process to determine the value that can be booked in the financial statements for the individual non-monetary assets.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: - we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control; - we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors; - we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this matter in forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern; - we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. With reference to the statement required by art. 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legislative Decree n. 39, dated January 27, 2010, based on our knowledge and understanding of the entity and its environment obtained through our audit, we have no matters to report.

Introduction and other information",1228.14.1,,"This document represents the first consolidated financial statements prepared by Multiversity S.r.l. (hereinafter also the ‘Parent Company’ or ‘Company’), established on October 1, 2019, which closed with a consolidated profit for the year of € 633,224 net of taxes of accrued in the year and shows the economic-financial data of a three-month year of activity of solely the Parent Company. The reason for this simplification is described in more detail in the section dedicated to the consolidation criteria. For this reason, the layouts of the Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account do not show the corresponding values of the previous financial statements. These consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2019, consisting of the Balance Sheet, the Income Statement, the Cash Flow Statement and the Explanatory Notes, have been drawn up in compliance with the drafting principles and the formats referred to in articles 2423 et seq. of the Italian Civil Code and the legislation set forth in Legislative Decree no. 127 of 9/4/1991, without applying any of the exceptions provided for by art. 2423, paragraph 5, of the Italian Civil Code. The aforementioned legislation has been interpreted and supplemented, where necessary, by the accounting standards issued by the Italian Accounting Standards Setter (OIC), in their version revised in 2016. These consolidated financial statements, drawn up in Euro units, consist of the Balance Sheet (prepared in accordance with the format provided for by articles 2424 and 2424 bis of the Italian Civil Code), the Income Statement (prepared in accordance with the format referred to in to articles 2425 and 2425 bis of the Italian Civil Code), the Cash Flow Statement (the content of which, in compliance with article 2425-ter of the Italian Civil Code, is presented in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standard OIC 10) and these Explanatory Notes, drawn up in accordance with the provisions of art. 2427 and 2427-bis of the Italian Civil Code. The entire document, as regards the parts of which it is composed, has been drawn up in such a way as to give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Multiversity Group (‘Group’), as well as of the economic result for the year, providing, where necessary, additional complementary information for this purpose. In relation to the content of the explanatory notes pursuant to art. 2427 of the Italian Civil Code, the Group: - has not issued any bonds and/or similar financial instruments; - did not carry out any financing transactions with the temporary sale of assets during the 2019 fiscal year; - has not carried out any asset lending transactions against a security deposit of a sum of money; - has no off-balance sheet agreements in place other than those reported in both these Explanatory Notes and in the Report on Operations, knowledge of which is useful for evaluating the equity and financial situation of the company; - has not carried out any atypical or unusual transactions, or transactions that are unrelated to the normal management of the company or capable of significantly affecting the Group’s economic and equity situation; - has not issued any shares with regular dividend entitlement and bonds convertible into shares, or securities or similar instruments pursuant to art. 2427, first paragraph, no. 18 of the Italian Civil Code; - does not have any separate assets dedicated to specific business or any special-purpose loans pursuant to art. 2447 bis et seq. of the Italian Civil Code. In accordance with the provisions of art. 2423-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the following principles were observed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: - the individual items were measured on the basis of the principles of prudence and based on the going concern assumption, as well as taking into account the economic function of the asset or liability element considered; - only the profits actually realised during the year have been indicated; - the income and expenses for the year have been indicated, regardless of when they were collected; F-63 -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The Balance Sheet, the Income Statement and the Cash Flow Statement are drawn up in Euro units, rounding the amounts up or down; also in the explanatory notes the amounts are expressed in Euro units as they guarantee a better understanding of the document. For the elements of the assets or liabilities that fall under more than one item of the financial statements, the explanatory notes also outline whether they belong to the items other than those in which they are recorded, if this is necessary for the purposes of understanding the financial statements. Where applicable, the principles and recommendations published by the professional bodies responsible for accounting were also observed, in order to give a true and fair view of the equity, financial and economic situation. The share capital of the Parent Company at the date of incorporation was equal to € 100,000, fully subscribed by the company Multiversity S.p.A. The incorporation is effective from October 4, 2019. In October 2019, a corporate restructuring operation was carried out for the entry of the new financial partner into the share capital of the Parent Company, described below, whose objective is, in summarised form: - the transfer of the business unit, on October 25, 2019 by Multiversity S.p.A., in favour of Multiversity S.r.l., a newly formed company, including the investment held in Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. (direct parent of Università Telematica S.r.l.). As a result of this extraordinary transaction, Multiversity S.r.l. acquired indirect control, through Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A., of Università Telematica S.r.l., as well as joint control of the investment in Certipass S.r.l.; - the entry into the capital of the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. of the new financial partner Paganini Investments Sàrl. It should be noted that, following the sale of the 50% stake in Multiversity S.r.l., Multivesity S.p.A. lost full control due to joint control and this case makes the accounting envisaged by OPI 1 not applicable. All the steps of the transaction summarised above are explained below. On October 25, 2019, Multiversity S.p.A. transferred to Multiversity S.r.l., with effect from October 28, 2019, the business unit that carries out university training support services. As a result of the aforementioned contribution, the value of which is equal to € 650 million, all existing relationships and all new activities relating to the aforementioned business unit are headed by the Parent Company with the aim of rationalising all the experience gained in the field of university training and replicating them in order to create the first ‘Global University’ with the same technology, philosophy, values and methods as such to make students feel at home in every university in the various countries of the world and allow the creation of multiple interdisciplinary and multicultural learning channels; a genuine ‘Business Model’ aimed at university and postgraduate training. Finally, on November 4, 2019 Multiversity S.p.A. sold 50% of Multiversity S.r.l. to the company Paganini Investments S.a.r.l. During the 2019 fiscal year, the transformation process of the subsidiary Università Telematica Pegaso (controlled by Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. which turns out to be the promoter, in turn wholly-owned by Multiversity S.r.l.) into a ‘joint stock company’ was completed, undertaken during the 2018 fiscal year. The process was definitively concluded with the registration in the Register of Companies of Naples, on 25.06.2019, of the transformation resolution adopted by the BoD on 19.11.2018. From a legal point of view, the transformation transaction implemented by the University falls within the so-called ‘progressive heterogeneous transformations’ governed by art. 2500-octies of the Italian Civil Code; the main effect of this operation was the University’s move from a non-commercial entity to a limited liability company. F-64 ----- In February 2019, the indirect subsidiary Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. established Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l. (jointly with the subsidiary Universitas Mercatorum, which holds a 10% stake in the share capital of the same), a consortium company with the aim of coordinating, carrying out and supporting the procedures and deeds relating to the implementation, on behalf of the two consortium members (Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. and Universitas Mercatorum), of their respective management programmes. In particular, the company favours coordination between the shareholders with reference to the concession contract for the management and use of the property ‘Colonia Montana Principe di Napoli as a Centre for Higher Education and Postgraduate Studies in the gastronomy and tourism sectors’, stipulated with the Municipality of Agerola in execution of the award of the open tender procedure announced by means of GC resolution no. 105 of September 14, 2018 and with subsequent determination of the LLPP (Public Works) and Environment Sector of the aforementioned Municipality no. 140 of September 19, 2018. The facility was temporarily closed due to the COVID emergency and is close to the complete resumption of educational activities. The Parent Company is not subject to management and coordination activities pursuant to Article 2497 of the Italian Civil Code. The shareholders’ meeting on November 4, 2019 appointed the auditing company EY S.p.A. asthe statutory audititors of the separate and consolidated financial statements of Multiversity S.r.l. for the three-year period 2019/2021. The details of the transfer of a business unit by Multiversity S.p.A. are shown below: Where applicable, the principles and recommendations published by the professional bodies responsible for accounting were also observed, in order to give a true and fair view of the Group’s equity, financial and economic situation. There have been no exceptional cases, incompatible with the general clause of true and fair view, pursuant to art. 2423, paragraph 5 of the Italian Civil Code, which required an exception to the legal provisions for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. In compliance with accounting standard OIC 29, no corrections have been made in the consolidated financial statements for significant errors committed in previous years. The table below shows the list of companies excluded from consolidation: provision for future risks and charges’ against estimated liabilities, this would be credited to the consolidated shareholders’ equity under the item ‘Consolidation reserve’. The portion of shareholders ‘equity attributable to minority interests of the consolidated subsidiaries is entered under the item ‘Capital and reserves pertaining to minority interests’ of the shareholders’ equity, while the minority interests’ share of the net result is shown separately in the consolidated income statement under the item ‘Profit/(loss) of pertaining to minority interests’. - The credit and debit items between the companies included in the consolidation have been eliminated. - The income and charges relating to transactions between the companies included in the consolidation, starting from the first consolidation, have been eliminated. - Significant profits and losses deriving from transactions between companies included in the consolidation relating to values still included in the balance sheet at the end of the year have been eliminated. - Dividends distributed within the group were reversed from the consolidated income statement. - The conversion into Euro of financial statements expressed in foreign currencies is carried out using the ‘current exchange rate’ method. The historical exchange rate at the date of first consolidation at December 31, 2019 was used for the items of shareholders’ equity, the year-end exchange rate for the assets and liabilities of the balance sheet and the average exchange rate for those of the income statement. Any foreign exchange translation differences are charged directly to shareholders’ equity in the specific item ‘Translation reserve’. - The differences deriving from the elimination of intra-group payables, receivables, costs and revenues in foreign currencies have been recorded under item ‘17-bis) Exchange gains and losses’. - A deferred tax provision has been recorded on not distributable profits and reserves subject to deferred tax in consideration of any possible future distribution. The cost of these intangible assets also includes the costs incurred for filing copyrights in the public software register. reasonably verifiable facts. If, on the other hand, the investee has prepared plans and programmes aimed at restoring the conditions of economic-financial equilibrium, with characteristics as such to justify the belief that the impairment of the investment is temporary, this can be defined as non-permanent. Equity investments include investments in joint stock companies, consortium companies and consortia. Equity investments recorded under fixed assets represent a long-lasting and strategic investment by the Group. In the consolidated financial statements there are no long-term investments for a value higher than their fair value. When it appears that the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly different from the market rate, the payable (and the corresponding cost in the case of commercial transactions) is initially recognised at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows and taking into account any transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate. In the case of payables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value of the payable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as a financial charge over the duration of the payable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial payables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest expense accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with the value of the payable as a contra entry. The value of the payables is subsequently reduced by the amounts paid, both as principal and interest. The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortized cost and the discounting back are not relevant when the due date is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and substantial considerations in place when the payable is recognised, and the transaction costs and any difference between the initial value and nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting is omitted and the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered among deferrals and amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the payable to adjust the nominal interest expense. Assets deriving from prepaid taxes are not recognised, in compliance with the prudence principle, if there is no reasonable certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be reversed, of a taxable income higher than the amount of the differences that will be cancelled. Liabilities for deferred taxes are recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year in which the tax asset will be realised or the tax liability will be settled, based on the tax legislation established by the provisions in force at the reporting date. The item receivables from other companies, equal to € 44,342,642, mainly includes receivables due from the shareholder Multiversity S.p.A. for € 43,908,000 relating to the sale by Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. of financial holdings in subsidiaries, while the remainder includes security deposits for an amount of € 434,642. The item Accrued income and prepaid expenses, equal to € 636,100 as of December 31, 2019, mainly includes the deferred cost of the Group’s offices leased and of the leased assets, as well as the costs incurred for strategic and digital consultancy, of advertising, insurance premiums, research, development and training costs with an accrual period referring to several fiscal years. The Provision for sundry risks almost entirely includes an estimate of the potential contributions accrued in previous years to be paid to training partners. For more extensive information, it is recalled that on November 20, 2019 a tax audit was launched by the Revenue Agency on Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. and Università Telematica S.r.l. for the years prior to the transformation of the Pegaso University into a joint-stock company for the tax years from 2015 to 2019. On the basis of the current status of the audits, there are consequently no prerequisites for setting aside any provisions, in view of the circumstances, in full compliance with the current regulations and the provisions of accounting standard OIC 31. The item payables to welfare and social security institutions, amounting to € 749,505, includes payables relating to mandatory contributions accrued and not yet paid to social security and welfare institutions. The item payables to others, equal to € 2,773,244, mainly includes payables to employees of Group companies for wages and holidays to be paid to their employees. The Group operates almost entirely in the national domain. Consequently, all payables refer to this geographical area, except for payables for an amount of € 581,326 referring to the territory of Malta. - € 31,000 to payables for rental costs to the related party Mr. Danilo Iervolino for rental costs relating to the property located in Piazza Trieste e Trento, 48 Naples (NA) where Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. has its registered office.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The financial statements of some companies included in the consolidation have been reclassified and adjusted to bring them into line with the accounting principles adopted by the Group; in particular, those of the foreign companies have been appropriately reclassified to make the balance sheet and financial data and the form of presentation consistent with that required for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The consolidation principles adopted for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows: - the financial statements of the subsidiaries included in the consolidation area have been consolidated using the line-by-line method, which consists in the assumption of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses in their total amount, regardless of the size of the shareholding held and the attribution to third-party shareholders, in the items ‘Capital and reserves pertaining to minority interests’ and ‘Profit/(Loss) for the year attributable to minority interest’, respectively, of the portion of shareholders’ equity and profit/loss for the year pertaining to them. - the financial statements of the companies in which the Parent Company holds joint control are consolidated by applying the proportional consolidation method, which provides for the proportional inclusion in the consolidated financial statements of the assets, liabilities, costs, revenues and cash flows of the companies over which it exercises joint control with shareholders not belonging to the group, considering only the part of their value corresponding to the interest held directly or indirectly by the parent company. - The financial statements of associated companies are valued by applying the equity method, with which the original cost of the investment changes in the periods following the acquisition of the investment to take into account the pertinent shares of profits and losses and other changes in the shareholders’ equity of the investee. - The book value of equity investments consolidated using the line-by-line method was eliminated against the corresponding share of shareholders’ equity, less the result for the year, at the date of first inclusion in the consolidation (taking into account what is specified in the next point). The difference between the acquisition cost and the net equity at fair value of the subsidiaries at the consolidation date is allocated, where possible, to the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries net of deferred taxes, where applicable; any remaining difference, if positive and if the requirements for recording goodwill provided for by OIC 24 are met, is recognised in the item ‘Goodwill’ within intangible assets. The residual difference that cannot be allocated to assets and liabilities and to goodwill is charged to the income statement under item ‘B14 Other operating expenses. - With regard to the date relating to the first inclusion in the scope of consolidation, it should be noted that the Parent Company, having finalised the transfer described above on 27 October 2019 and not having approved financial statements close to that date, decided to make use of the option granted by accounting standard OIC 17 to proceed with the first consolidation on the date in which the company is included in the consolidation area for the first time, and therefore with effect from December 31, 2019. - Goodwill is amortised on the basis of estimated economic use according to its useful life, taking into account all the information available to determine the period in which the economic benefits will materialise; in exceptional cases in which it is not possible to reliably estimate their life, it is amortised over a period not exceeding ten years. - If an excess of shareholders’ equity is recognised over the acquisition cost, after having reduced, if necessary, the values of the assets recorded to their recoverable value and of the liabilities recognised to a value lower than their settlement value, net of prepaid taxes and having established the ‘Consolidation F-67 -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

In the absence of indicators of potential impairment, the recoverable value is not determined. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and its value in use determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows. An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value.

Receivables originating for different reasons are recognised if there is a ‘title’ to the receivable and therefore when they actually represent a third-party obligation to the company; if of a financial nature they are classified under financial fixed assets, with an indication of the portion due within the next fiscal year. Receivables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, taking into account the time factor, and within the limits of their presumed realisable value and, therefore, are shown in the balance sheet net of the related bad debt provision deemed adequate to cover losses due to reasonably foreseeable non-collectability. If the interest rate of the transaction is not significantly different from the market rate, the receivable is initially recorded at a value equal to the nominal value net of all premiums, discounts, rebates and inclusive of any costs directly attributable to the transaction, which generated the receivable. These transaction costs, any commission income and expense and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are spread over the duration of the loan using the effective interest criterion. On the other hand, when the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly different from the market rate, the receivable (and the corresponding revenue in the case of commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows plus any transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate. In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value of the receivable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as financial income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest income accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with the value of the receivable as a contra entry. The value of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the amounts received, both by way of principal and interest, as well as for any write-downs to bring the receivables back to their presumed realisable value or for losses. The Group assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and the discounting back are not relevant when the maturity of the receivables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and substantial considerations in place on recognition of the receivable, and the transaction costs and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity is of an insignificant amount.

Information on significant events occurring after the close of the fiscal year,1228.106.1,,"With the Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of March 1, 2020 ‘Further implementing provisions of the decree-law of February 23, 2020, n. 6’, containing urgent measures regarding the containment and management of the epidemiological emergency from COVID-19 and published in GU (Official Journal) Special Series no. 52 of March 1, 2020, among other things, the temporary closure of the Universities and Institutions of Higher Artistic, Musical and Choreutic Education was arranged, without prejudice to the possibility of carrying out distance learning activities. By means of subsequent memoranda and implementing provisions, starting from March 2020, universities and AFAM institutions were entitled, in the exercise of their autonomy, to prioritise alternative distance-based methods, mid-course examinations, including graduation sessions, which can be carried out using remote access methods. These provisions, if reasonably confirmed also following the resolution of the COVID emergency, constitute a change of epic proportions in the processes on which traditional teaching is based, contributing significantly to the promotion of modern and indeed more democratic and global university education, helping to create a ‘Global University’ with the same technology, philosophy, values and methods able to make students feel at home in every university in the various countries of the world and allow the creation of multiple learning, interdisciplinary and multicultural channels. Further assessments are carried out through continuous monitoring of the regulatory context and of all the provisions of the bodies in charge in order to guarantee the full safety of workers. With reference to the performance of Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l, the Group’s main strategic asset, in the period of pandemic emergency, it should be noted that the indirect subsidiary, given the method of providing courses in e-learning mode, did not suffer any impact on the performance of enrolments compared to the same period of the previous year. In January 2020, the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. entered into a revolving loan agreement with a leading bank for a maximum limit, in the event of drawdown, of € 15 million, with Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. and Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. guarantors in the event of any default by the Company. The loan was not used by the Parent Company at the date of preparation of this document. As described in the paragraph Provisions for risks and charges, please note that on November 20, 2019 a tax audit was initiated by the Italian Revenue Agency for Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. and Università Telematica S.r.l. for the years prior to the transformation of the Pegaso University to a joint stock company for the tax years from 2015 to 2019. Audit activities are currently under way. It should be noted that in May 2020, as part of the facilitation measures issued by the Italian government following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Legislative Decree no. 34 of May 19, 2020 on ‘Urgent measures in the field of health, support for work and the economy, as well as social policies related to the epidemiological emergency from COVID-19’, exemption from payment of the IRAP balance relating to 2019, was given to companies with total revenues not exceeding € 250,000,000. The companies of the Group, therefore, falling into the above category, in the preparation of the UNICO2020 model, relating to the fiscal year 2019, will account for contingent assets equal to the amount of the payable recorded in the financial statements as at December 31, 2019, relating to the tax IRAP not due. The valuation criteria set forth herein comply with the statutory regulations and the results of the consolidated financial statements correspond to the accounting records kept in compliance with the regulations in force. These explanatory notes, as well as the entire financial statements of which they constitute an integral part, give a true and fair view of the equity and financial situation of the Group and the economic result for the year.

The income generated by courses derives entirely from the fees and ancillary contributions paid by the learners for the use of courses in e-learning mode. These are mainly fees for single-cycle master’s degree courses (Law), three-year degree courses (Civil Engineering, Business Economics, Tourism Sciences, Sport Sciences, Education and Training Sciences), two-year master’s degree courses (Education Sciences, Economic Sciences, Sport Management and Sport Sciences, and Safety Engineering), as well as master’s, postgraduate courses and higher education courses. The University, unlike most of the Italian public and private universities, does not receive the usual contributions paid by the State, including the ordinary MIUR funding (“FFO”), or by other public or private entities, aimed at covering management and operating costs without any result-linked constraint. The company also pays great attention to national and international research activities, as well as to the promotion of training of younger generations in research activities. Both within and outside of the EU, consistently with the general principles set out in its Articles of Association, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. promotes the international development of education, research and studies, also and in particular through cultural exchanges between different countries and collaboration with the most prestigious universities within the Community area. Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. has offices located throughout Italy, in many cases within the most prestigious palaces and monumental town complexes, places with the highest historical and cultural profile, also testifying to the University’s authority and the consideration it enjoys among institutions, which have recognised its commitment, quality and high educational profile, and therefore allowed the use of their premises. In recent years, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. has achieved ever-increasing positive results by focusing on innovative projects, on the quality of its research, training processes and services. The University aims to play a driving role in cultural and economic development at the local, national and international level. For this reason, it has deemed it appropriate, as better described below, to change its legal form into one more suitable for a larger entity, also in accordance with the new and broader objectives that the entire education sector must focus on, following the profound social and economic transformations which, inevitably, have also had strong repercussions on education and training. During the fiscal year, the activity was carried out on a regular basis; there were no events that significantly changed the management performance and which made it necessary to resort to the exceptions referred to in art. 2423, paragraph 5, of the Italian Civil Code. Finally, it should be noted that in January 2020 the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. stipulated a revolving loan agreement with a primary credit institution for a maximum use, in the event of a drawdown, of € 15 million, with Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. guarantor in the event of any default by the Parent Company. The loan was not used by the Parent Company at the date of preparation of this document. The cost of intangible assets, whose use is limited over time, is systematically amortised in each fiscal year according to their residual possible use. In particular, amortisation rates are applied that reflect the estimated useful life of the assets. The rates used are summarised in the following table: OIC 17. Equity investments accounted for using the equity method are initially recognised at purchase cost, including ancillary charges. On initial recognition, the purchase cost of the equity investment is compared with the value of the corresponding share of the shareholders’ equity resulting on the purchase date or on the date resulting from the last financial statements of the investee. An initial positive difference (i.e. when the cost incurred for the purchase of the equity investment is higher than the corresponding fraction of the shareholders’ equity of the investee) is maintained in the book value of the equity investment if it is attributable to higher values of the assets in the investee’s balance sheet or in the presence of goodwill, and indicating the reasons for it in the Explanatory Notes; this difference must be amortised for the part attributable to depreciable assets, including goodwill. Otherwise, the initial value of the equity investment is written down and the difference is recognised in the income statement under item D19a) “write-downs of equity investments”. In the presence of an initial negative difference (i.e. when the cost incurred for the purchase of the equity investment is lower than the corresponding fraction of shareholders’ equity of the investee), if this is not attributable to the forecast of losses but to the completion of a good business, the equity investment is entered at the higher value of the adjusted shareholders’ equity of the investee company with respect to the cost price, recognising in a non-distributable reserve under the item AVI “Other reserves” the capital gains on of the equity investments acquired as a counter-entry. If the initial negative difference is instead due to the presence of assets recorded for values higher than their recoverable value or liabilities recorded at a value lower than their extinction value or, again, to the forecast of unfavourable economic results, the equity investment is initially recognised for a value equal to the cost incurred. The original book value of the equity investment is modified in the periods following the acquisition to take into account the portions pertaining to profits and losses and other changes in the shareholders’ equity of the investee. In particular, the investee’s profit or loss for the year, duly adjusted to eliminate the effects of intra-companies transactions and to take into account any other adjustments necessary according to OIC 17, are recognised in the Income Statement of the investee, for the portion pertaining to it, according to the accruals principle in item D18 a) “revaluations of equity investments” or D19 a) “write-downs of equity investments” with a counter entry, respectively, in the increase or decrease in the related items of the equity investments recorded in fixed assets. If the shareholders’ equity of the investee increases, as a result of monetary revaluation pursuant to special laws, or decreases, due to a reduction in share capital or distribution of reserves, the value of the shareholding will be respectively increased or reduced in the investing company’s balance sheet and that of the non-distributable reserve. In any case, these changes are not recognised in the income statement. In the case of capital operations that modify the measure of the shareholders’ equity of the investee pertaining to the Company, the change in the value of the equity investment is recorded in the same way as a realisation transaction carried out with third parties which increases or reduces the value of the equity investment with a corresponding entry respectively in item D18 a) “write-downs of equity investments” or D19 a) “write-downs of equity investments”. The book value of the equity investment is written down in the presence of permanent losses in value, determined by comparing the book value of the equity investment with its recoverable value, calculated on the basis of the future benefits that are expected to flow into the investor’s economy. This occurs when the loss in value is caused by factors internal or external to the Company, or to a combination of them, and it is not expected that the reasons that caused it can be eliminated in a short period of time. All evaluations are carried out separately for each individual equity investment. Equity investments include investments in joint stock companies, consortium companies and consortia. Equity investments recorded under fixed assets represent long-lasting and strategic investments by the company. Receivables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, taking into account the time factor, and within the limits of their presumed realisable value and, therefore, are shown in the balance sheet net of the related bad debt provision deemed adequate to cover losses due to reasonably predicted bad debt. If the transaction’s interest rate is not significantly different from the market rate, the receivable is initially recorded at a value equal to the nominal value net of all premiums, discounts, rebates and inclusive of any costs directly attributable to the transaction that generated the receivable. These transaction costs, any commission income and expense and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are spread over the duration of the loan using the effective interest criterion. On the other hand, when the interest rate of the transaction inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly different from the market rate, the receivable (and the corresponding revenue in the case of commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows plus any transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate. In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value of the receivable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as financial income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest income accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with an offsetting entry against the value of the receivable. The value of the receivables is subsequently reduced by the amounts received, both by way of principal and interest, as well as for any write-downs to bring the receivables to their presumed realisable value or for losses. The Company assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and of its discount are irrelevant when the maturity of the receivables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and substantive considerations in place at the time the credit is recognised, and the transaction costs and any difference between the initial value and the nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting is omitted, the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered under deferrals and amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the receivable to adjust the nominal interest income. Potential liabilities are recognised in the financial statements and recorded in the provisions when their manifestation is considered probable and when the amount of the related charge can be reasonably estimated. Any risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible or for which no objective forecast of the resulting charge is possible are indicated in the Explanatory Notes without making allocations to provisions for risks and charges. Risks whose probability of occurrence appears remote are not taken into account. difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract suggests the attribution a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest expense accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with an offsetting entry against the value of the payable. The value of the payables is subsequently reduced by the amounts paid, both in terms of the principal and of interest. The Company assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and the discount are irrelevant when the due date of payables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and substantial considerations in place when the payable is recognised, and the costs transaction and any difference between initial value and nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting is omitted and the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered under deferrals and amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the payable to adjust the nominal interest expense. Deferred and prepaid taxes are determined on the temporary differences between the value attributed to the assets and liabilities according to statutory criteria and the value attributed to the same assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are entered under the ‘Deferred tax reserve’ recorded under liabilities among the provisions for risks and charges, while prepaid taxes are recorded under receivables from others under current assets. Assets deriving from prepaid taxes are not recognised, in compliance with the principle of prudence, if there is no reasonable certainty of the existence, in the fiscal years in which the relative temporary differences will be reversed, of a taxable income higher than the amount of the differences to be cancelled. Liabilities for deferred taxes are recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty that they will be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are valued at the estimated tax rates applicable in the year in which the tax assets will be realised or the tax liability will be extinguished, based on the tax legislation established by provisions in force at the reference date of the financial statements. The company is currently inactive and the value of the equity investment is recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2020 for € 28,643. The associated company Benecon S.c.a.r.l. is a university research consortium participated by 5 universities; it is endowed with skills and technologies of high scientific and innovative value which carries out scientific research in the fields of engineering and aerial surveys of territories. The equity investment in the consortium was acquired with a deed by notary Paolo Guida on October 10, 2016 (file no. 30224—volume no. 14151) for a consideration of € 100,000 and the University holds a share with a nominal value of € 203,614 (equal to 63% of the share capital of € 150,000). This equity investment is recognised in the financial statements at December 31, 2020 for € 1,175,526. The item “Receivables from subsidiaries” decreased compared to the previous year by € 352,000 (+6%). The changes that occurred during the year are provided in detail: - Pegaso Management S.r.l.—The loan expires on December 31, 2021, but rescheduling of this loan beyond 12 months is being defined. - Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l.—During the previous year, the University disbursed non-interest bearing loans to the subsidiary consortium company for a total of € 1,250,000, partially offset by the consortium contributions charged in 2019 by the subsidiary. In the 2020 fiscal year, additional loans were disbursed for € 600 thousand. The receivable as at December 31, 2020 amounts to € 1,289,300. At the end of each fiscal year, it is checked that the conditions that determined the initial recognition of the accrual or deferred income are still met; if necessary, the necessary value adjustments are made. This valuation takes into account not only the passage of time but also the possible recoverability of the amount recognised in the financial statements. There are no accrued income and prepaid expenses with a duration of more than 5 years. _KEY/NOTES: A = for capital increase B = to cover losses C = for distribution to shareholders D = for other statutory constraints E = other_ S.p.A., pursuant to and for the purposes of art. 2 of the University Statute, as better described in the relevant comment section of the income statement items of this document. It should be noted that the contract in question ceased to all effects starting from the 2020 fiscal year; - for € 3,515,246 for royalties accrued during the 2020 fiscal year to the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. as per the contract signed on February 1st, 2016. This contract provides for the concession for use by the Università Telematica Pegaso of the Pegaso brand, the entire software structure for distance learning activities, technology, specific know-how and functional platforms for online university training and teaching activities, management and administration of the University; The table below shows the change in the item “Payables to parent companies” compared to 2020: The following table shows the change in the aforementioned item: agreements with companies or foundations, or with other public or private subjects, for periods not exceeding six years, with financial charges borne by the same subjects, through the conferral of assignments of a maximum duration of three years, renewable on the basis of a new agreement, to those who have are eligible for the category of full professors, or to subjects with high scientific and professional qualifications. The University, in fulfilment of the aforementioned agreement, approved in advance by the Academic Bodies and signed with the funding body, stipulates a contract for the appointment of extraordinary professor for the professor entrusted with the related research project. - € 325,806 from revenues from the 0.5% contributions allocated to the University through tax returns; - € 194,007 from income linked to various projects and agreements. In the context of this case, the main projects in which our University participates are: a) for € 125,170 the “Skills for school, skills for life” project signed with the Campania Region, whose objective is linked to the establishment of a list of internal Italian language and mathematics teachers to be entrusted, following a training course carried out by the Implementing Body, with training actions that will be activated as part of the project b) for € 78,000, the “TISMA” project signed with the Campania Region, whose objective is linked to the creation of an integrated platform for monitoring historic centres of high artistic and cultural value. - € 19.039 from income related to “Erasmus” projects; the University participates in the aforementioned project, whose objective is to encourage the mobility abroad of university students; - € 27,578 from proceeds related to the Cisotra project. The University participates in the aforementioned project whose objective is to develop and implement an innovative methodology to fill the current gap in support for unaccompanied minors towards adulthood. Finally, it should be noted that the income from the 0.5% contributions was fully reinvested in research activities carried out within the University’s institutional activities, also in compliance with the resolution of the Board of Directors of December 16, 2019. VAT, for the entire five-year duration of a series of obligations undertaken by said ECPs, including the obligation of not undertaking activities in competition with those of the University. The transaction was formalised due to the decision to internalise the main activities carried out by the ECPs at the University structures. Therefore, this operation falls within a broader context of reorganisation of the group’s structure, also in order to optimise internal processes. With reference to the subsidiary Giapeto Editore S.r.l., relations of a commercial nature relate to research projects carried out by the University on behalf of the subsidiary. Receivables and revenues of a commercial nature from the company Certipass S.r.l. (50% controlled by Multiversity S.r.l.) for an amount of € 45 thousand, mainly relate to the sale by the University of training packages. With reference to the subsidiary Pegaso Management S.r.l., there are financial receivables equal to € 4,714 thousand, relating to non-interest bearing loans disbursed by the University in favour of the subsidiary in previous years and relationships of a commercial nature relative to research projects carried out by the University on behalf of the subsidiary. With reference to the subsidiary Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l., there are financial receivables for a value of € 1,289 thousand, for non-interest bearing loans disbursed for an amount of € 600 thousand in the 2020 fiscal year and for an amount of € 689 in the 2019 fiscal year. Financial payables for an amount of € 685 thousand refer to the consortium contribution to the investee, while the commercial relations of € 2 thousand mainly concern the recharging of direct costs by Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l. A further € 785 thousand refer to the consortium contribution paid for the year 2020. Lastly, with reference to the subsidiary 3D Civil Engineering Lab S.r.l., relations of a commercial nature refer to technical consultancy provided by the latter to the University. Below is a summary table showing the main relationships with related parties: creating multidisciplinary paths and focusing on the enhancement and support of that training potential which, put to good use, constitutes the driving force for the country’s longed-for social growth. On February 2, 2021, Ministerial Decree 133 was issued (Amendment of the guidelines attached to Ministerial Decree no. 386/2007—Flexibility of study courses) aimed at universities. In order ‘to enhance the university autonomy in determining the educational systems of the study courses with regard to similar or supplementary training activities and to allow greater flexibility in the determination of the training courses’, it is established that: the university institutions, in the their autonomy, define the related or supplementary activities, referred to in art. 10, paragraph 5, of the regulation adopted with decree no. 270 of October 22, 2004, in the educational regulations of the course of study, in line with the objectives of the training course. In the educational system, only the total credits assigned to these activities are indicated. All training activities relating to scientific-disciplinary sectors not envisaged for basic and specialised activities can be part of the similar or supplementary activities, as defined by the ministerial decrees determining the degree classes and master’s degree classes, which ensure a multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary training of the student. The related and supplementary training activities can be organised in the form of teaching courses, laboratories, exercises, seminars or other activities as long as they are aimed at acquiring knowledge and skills functionally related to the cultural and professional profile identified by the course of study. Ministerial Decree 289/2020 was published on March 25, 2021 concerning the GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR THE PROGRAMMING OF UNIVERSITIES 2021-2023 and INDICATORS FOR THE PERIODIC EVALUATION OF THE RESULTS for which the definition of new indicators is expected for the initial and periodic accreditation of university offices and courses by of ANVUR.",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

Significant events that occurred during the year,1228.145.1,,"With regard to the performance for the year and the future prospects of the Company, the following is set out. With the Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of March 1, 2020 “Further implementing provisions of the decree-law of February 23, 2020, no. 6”, containing urgent measures regarding the containment and management of the epidemiological emergency from COVID-19 and published in GU Special Series no. 52 of March 1, 2020, among other things, the temporary closure of the Universities and Institutions of Higher Artistic, Musical and Choreutic Education was arranged, without prejudice to the possibility of carrying out distance learning activities. With subsequent acts and implementing provisions, starting from March 2020, universities and AFAM institutions were entitled, in the exercise of their autonomy, to prioritise alternative remote methods, progress examinations, including graduation sessions, which can be carried out using remote access methods. These provisions, if reasonably confirmed also following the resolution of the COVID emergency, constitute a change of epic proportions in the processes on which traditional teaching is based, contributing in a dramatic manner to the promotion of a modern and indeed more democratic and global university education, functional to the creation of a ‘Global University’ with the same technology, philosophy, values and methods able to make students feel at home in every university in the various countries of the world and allow the creation of multiple learning, interdisciplinary and multicultural channels. The University immediately activated all the necessary measures to allow all employees to work remotely in order to guarantee their full safety and at the same time the operation of all activities. F-92 ----- During the 2019 fiscal year, the process of converting the University into a “joint stock company”, undertaken during the 2018 fiscal year, was completed. The process was definitively concluded with the registration in the Register of Companies of Naples, on June 25, 2019, of the conversion resolution adopted by the BoD on November 19, 2018, as a result of which the conversion became immediately effective. From a legal point of view, the conversion transaction implemented by the University falls within the so-called ‘progressive heterogeneous conversions’ governed by art. 2500-octies of the Italian Civil Code; the main effect of this operation was the University’s move from a non-commercial entity to a joint stock company. In February 2019, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. established Principe di Napoli S.c.a.r.l. (jointly with the subsidiary Universitas Mercatorum, which holds a 10% stake in the share capital of the same), a consortium company with the aim of coordinating, carrying out and supporting the procedures and deeds relating to the implementation, on behalf of the two consortium members (Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. and Universitas F-132 -----",,as_expected,2021,551,,,,

The Balance Sheet and the Income Statement are prepared in Euro units, rounding the amounts up or down, in accordance to the provision of the EU Regulation; also in the explanatory notes, amounts are expressed in Euro units as they guarantee a better document clarity.

An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value. Subsequently, when the impairment of an asset, other than goodwill, no longer applies or is reduced, the book value of the asset or of the cash-generating unit is increased to the new estimate of the recoverable value without exceeding the value that would have been determined if no impairment had been detected. At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether there are indicators to suggest that an asset may have suffered an impairment. If such an indicator is present, the Company estimates the recoverable value of the asset and writes it down only if this is lower than the corresponding net book value. In the absence of indicators of potential impairment, the recoverable value is not calculated. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of their fair value net of sales costs and its value in use determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows. An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value.

Highly technological and interactive tools, TV learning and social learning involve the student in a truly unique and effective educational experience. Academic qualifications awarded at the end of study courses have the same legal value as qualifications issued by traditional universities. In the context of the educational offer, both graduate and postgraduate courses are available. The income generated by courses derives entirely from the fees and ancillary contributions paid by the learners for the use of courses in e-learning mode. These are mainly fees for single-cycle master’s degree courses (Law), three-year degree courses (Civil Engineering, Business Economics, Tourism Sciences, Sport Sciences, Education and Training Sciences), two-year master’s degree courses (Education Sciences, Economic Sciences, Sport Management and Sport Sciences, and Safety Engineering), as well as master’s, postgraduate courses and higher education courses. The University, unlike most of the Italian public and private universities, does not receive the usual contributions paid by the State, including the ordinary MIUR funding (“FFO”), or by other public or private entities, aimed at covering management and operating costs without any result-linked constraint. The Company also pays great attention to national and international research activities, as well as to the promotion of training of younger generations in research activities. Both within and outside of the EU, consistently with the general principles set out in its Articles of Association, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. promotes the international development of education, research and studies, also and in particular through cultural exchanges between different countries and collaboration with the most prestigious universities within the Community area. Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. has offices located throughout Italy, in many cases within the most prestigious palaces and monumental town complexes, places with the highest historical and cultural profile, also testifying to the University’s authority and the consideration it enjoys among institutions, which have recognised its commitment, quality and high educational profile, and therefore allowed the use of their premises. In recent years, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. has achieved ever-increasing positive results by focusing on innovative projects, on the quality of its research, training processes and services. The University aims to play a driving role in cultural and economic development at the local, national and international level. For this reason, it has deemed it appropriate, as better described below, to change its legal form into one more suitable for a larger entity, also in accordance with the new and broader objectives that the entire education sector must focus on, following the profound social and economic transformations which, inevitably, have also had strong repercussions on education and training. During the fiscal year, the activity was carried out in a regular basis; there were no events that significantly changed the management performance and which made it necessary to resort to the exceptions referred to in art. 2423, paragraph 5, of the Italian Civil Code. Mercatorum), of their respective management programmes. In particular, the company favours coordination between the shareholders with reference to the concession contract for the management and use of the property ‘Colonia Montana Principe di Napoli as a Centre for Higher Education and Postgraduate Studies in the gastronomy and tourism sectors’, stipulated with the Municipality of Agerola in execution of the award of the open tender procedure announced by means of GC resolution no. 105 of September 14, 2018 and with subsequent determination of the LLPP (Public Works) and Environment Sector of the aforementioned Municipality no. 140 of September 19, 2018. The facility was temporarily closed due to the Covid outbreak and, at the date of preparation of this document, new regulatory provisions are pending regarding the timing of reopening. In addition, in September and October 2019, a corporate reorganisation was carried out functional to the entry into the share capital of the Parent Company of the new financial partner, described below, concerning, in summary: - the transfer of the business unit, on October 25, 2019, from Multiversity S.p.A., the former Parent Company, to Multiversity S.r.l., a newly established company and current Parent Company, including the equity investment held in Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A. (now direct parent company of Università Telematica S.r.l.). As a result of this extraordinary transaction, Multiversity S.r.l. assumed indirect control of Università Telematica S.r.l. through Università Telematica Pegaso S.p.A.; - the sale by the University to Multiversity S.p.A. of some controlling equity investments considered no longer strategic and outside the reference corporate perimeter of the new shareholder; - the entry into the share capital of the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l. of the new financial partner Paganini Investments Sàrl. For an analytical description of the divestments of the controlling equity investments made by the University in implementation of the aforementioned reorganisation, as well as the economic and financial impacts of the aforementioned transactions, please refer to the section relating to “Equity investments in subsidiaries” later in this document. In November 2019, Paganini Investment Sàrl, indirectly controlled by the private equity funds assisted by CVC Capital Partners, acquired 50% of the share capital of the Parent Company Multiversity S.r.l.. Also taking into account the indications from operating practices, it was considered appropriate to draw up a balance sheet on the effective date of the conversion (June 25, 2019), in order to ascertain the value of the balance sheet components on the same date and the shareholders’ equity of the changing body. From a tax point of view, given the provisions of art. 171 of the TUIR, applicable to heterogeneous conversion operations (progressive and regressive) and to the practice documents published by the Revenue Agency (Resolution no. 102/2009), there is the need to carry out an extraordinary survey of the income realised on the date the conversion is considered to be completed, in consideration of the different quantification and qualification regime of the tax base applicable to the pre- (non-commercial) and post-conversion (commercial, and consequent classification in the business income category). Therefore, considering the tax provisions as well as the tax operating practices referred to above, the following were prepared: - the balance sheet and the income statement relating to the period between the beginning of the fiscal year and the day prior to the effective date of the conversion (January 1st 2019 to June 24, 2019), on the basis of which the result for the portion of the fiscal year and the shareholders’ equity of the entity was determined, converting on the conversion date the ordinary balance sheet for the year as at December 31, 2019 at the end of the normal administrative period, referred to in this document and including the determination of the entire fiscal year (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019); - the income statement for the period from June 25, 2019 to December 31, 2019, necessary for the quantification of corporate income taxes in the post-conversion period. Finally, it should be noted that Università Telematica Pegaso has drawn up the financial statements for the year preceding the one in which the conversion into a joint stock company took place, in compliance with the accounting standards and the schedules attached to the Interministerial Decree no. 19 of January 14, 2014 (hereinafter also referred to as “ID” for convenience) which definitively implemented Italian Legislative Decree no. 18 of January 27, 2012, and which introduced, for all universities, the obligation to keep an economic and financial accounting system and the preparation of individual universities’ annual financial statements. On this point, it is recalled that, as established by article 1, paragraph 3, of the aforementioned ID, in drawing up the financial statements the University has also always taken into account, for all that is not expressly sanctioned by the decree itself, the provisions of the Italian Civil Code (Article 2423 and following) and the national accounting standards issued by the Italian Accounting Organisation (OIC) and adapted by the latter to the new provisions of Italian Legislative Decree no. 139/2015 approved in accordance with EU directive 34/13, in addition to the indications contained in the technical-operational manual issued by the Commission for the economic and financial accounting of Universities envisaged by art. 9 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 18 of January 27, 2012 and in accordance with the provisions of art. 8 of the ID. It is further highlighted that the University, on the basis of the indications provided by the MIUR in the communication of June 19, 2019 concerning the authorisation to convert the company, will transmit to the Ministry the accounting documents required by art. 8, paragraph 2, of Italian Legislative Decree no. 18 of January 27, 2012, for non-state universities, as well as the certifications of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions laid down for limited liability companies. Finally, it should be noted that the application of the accounting standards and budget assumptions established by art. 2 of the aforementioned ID did not result in different book values for the previous year compared to those obtained with the application of the principles established by art. 2423/bis of the Italian Civil Code, with the consequence that, for the purposes of comparability of the items in these financial statements with those of the previous year, the items were exclusively reclassified according to the formats of the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement and Explanatory Note provided for by the Italian Civil Code - only the profits actually realised during the year have been included; - the income and expenses for the year have been included, regardless of their numerical manifestation; - the risks and losses pertaining to the year were taken into account, even if they became known after its closure; - the heterogeneous elements included in the various items of the financial statements were assessed separately; - the valuation criteria adopted were the same as those of the previous year. The Balance Sheet and the Income Statement are drawn up in Euro units, rounding the amounts up or down, in accordance to the provision of the EU Regulation; also in the explanatory notes, amounts are expressed in Euro units as they guarantee a better document clarity. For assets and liabilities elements that fall under more than one item of the financial statements, the explanatory notes also note whether they pertain to items other than those in which they are recorded, if this is necessary for the purposes of understanding the financial statements. Where applicable, the principles and recommendations enacted by the professional bodies responsible for accounting were also observed, always in order to give a true and fair view of the equity, financial and economic situation. There have been no exceptional cases, incompatible with the general clause of true and correct representation, pursuant to art. 2423, fifth paragraph of the Italian Civil Code, which imposed an exception to the provisions of the Law for the preparation of the Financial Statements. In accordance with the provisions of art. 2423-bis, point 6, of the Italian Civil Code, the valuation criteria were not changed from one year to another and there were no exceptional cases such as to justify an exception to this principle, pursuant to paragraph 2 of the same article. In compliance with accounting standard OIC 29, no corrections have been made in the Financial Statements for significant errors committed in previous years. The cost of intangible assets, whose use is limited over time, is systematically amortised in each fiscal year according to their residual possible use. In particular, amortisation rates are applied that reflect the estimated useful life of the assets. The amortization rates used are summarised in the following table: entered at purchase cost including accessory charges. The original book value of the equity investment is modified in the periods following the acquisition to consider the portions pertaining to profits and losses and other changes in the shareholders’ equity of the investee, thus applying the equity method. The book value of the equity investment is written down in the presence of permanent losses in value, determined by comparing the book value of the equity investment with its recoverable value, calculated on the basis of the future benefits that are expected to flow into the investor’s economy. This occurs when the loss in value is caused by factors internal or external to the Company, or to a combination of them, and it is not expected that the reasons that caused it can be eliminated in a short period of time. All evaluations are carried out separately for each individual equity investment. The advances received from customers for the supply of services not yet carried out are included in the item advances. Payables are valued in the financial statements at amortised cost, considering the time factor. If the transaction’s interest rate is not significantly different from the market rate, the payable is initially recognised at a value equal to the nominal value, net of all transaction costs and all premiums, discounts and rebates deriving directly from the transaction that generated the payable. These transaction costs, such as ancillary expenses for obtaining loans, any commission income and expenses and any difference between the initial value and nominal value at maturity, are spread over the duration of the payable using the effective interest criterion. On the other hand, when the transaction’s interest rate inferable from the contractual conditions is significantly different from the market rate, the payable (and the corresponding cost in the case of commercial transactions) is initially recorded at a value equal to the present value of future cash flows, taking into account any transaction costs. The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate. In the case of payables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value of the payable thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as a financial charge over the duration of the payable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial payables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed and the present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract suggests the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest expense accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with an offsetting entry against the value of the payable. The value of the payables is subsequently reduced by the amounts paid, both in terms of the principal and of interest. The Company assumes that the effects deriving from the application of the amortised cost and the discount are irrelevant when the due date of payables is within 12 months, also taking into account all the contractual and substantial considerations in place when the payable is recognised, and the costs transaction and any difference between initial value and nominal value at maturity are of an insignificant amount. In this case, discounting is omitted and the interest is calculated at nominal value and the transaction costs are entered under deferrals and amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the payable to adjust the nominal interest expense. The item “other revenues and income” includes positive non-financial income components deriving entirely from ancillary management. It should be noted that the income from teaching is accounted for in the year taking into account the principle of correlation of the revenues deriving from the enrolment of students in the academic year and the costs associated with the provision in the year of competence of the courses to students enrolled in the same academic year, using the deferred income method. In recording the revenue, account is taken of the peculiarity of the online university which does not allow the use of the service, and consequently of the costs incurred, except for regularly enrolled students. In 2019, in execution of the corporate reorganisation described in the paragraph “Significant events that occurred during the year”, Università Telematica Pegaso S.r.l. sold the following controlling equity investments to Multiversity S.p.A.: - by notarial deed dated September 20, 2019 (Notary Stefano Palladini, file no. 7238, volume no. 4988), the Equity Investment in the company “Pegaso Consulting S.r.l.” for the consideration of € 2,200,000 - by notarial deed dated October 2, 2019 (Notary Stefano Palladini, file no. 7278, volume no. 5015) the Equity Investment in the company “Bellerofonte Immobiliare S.r.l.” for the consideration of € 10,900,000; - by notarial deed dated October 30, 2019 (Notary Stefano Palladini, file no. 7366, volume no. 5077) the Equity Investment in the company “Atena Salus S.r.l.” for the consideration of € 18,043,000; - by notarial deed dated October 30, 2019 (Notary Stefano Palladini, file no. 7367, volume no. 5078) the Equity Investment in the company “Garage Start Up S.r.l.” for the consideration of € 12,765,000. As agreed in the agreements signed with the transferee Multiversity S.p.A., the consideration for the sale of the aforementioned equity investments, equal to a total of € 43,908,000, was determined to be equal to the book equity of the companies sold, resulting from the balance sheet at the date of the transfer of the company shares. This consideration will be settled by the end of the 2020 fiscal year. The receivable from Multiversity S.p.A. of € 43,908,000 is recorded under item 2) 4-bis of Financial Assets. The following table shows the changes in the item “Equity Investments in subsidiaries” in 2019: - Pegaso Consulting S.r.l. On September 11, 2019 the shareholders’ meeting of the subsidiary acknowledged the University’s waiver of the following receivables due from the investee: receivable for non-interest bearing loans of € 1,983,759; receivable for research projects of € 58,603. As mentioned above, the equity investment was then sold to Multiversity S.p.A. on September 20, 2019. Finally, with regard to the subsidiary 3D Civil Engineering Lab S.r.l., upon approval of the financial statements as at December 31, 2018, which took place on April 30, 2019, a payment was approved for the loss coverage of the investee of € 10,000. The payment was subsequently made on July 15, 2019. 3DCivil Engineering S.r.l. was established with a deed by notary Stefano Paladini on July 20, 2015 (file no. 1822—volume no. 1322) with share capital of € 10,000 subscribed by the University for € 8,500 (equal to 85% of the share capital). The company is currently inactive and the value of the equity investment is recorded in the financial statements as at December 31, 2019 for € 12,404. The item “Receivables from subsidiaries” equal to € 5,652,396 is represented by the receivables due from the subsidiaries for loans disbursed to support the business. The breakdown of the item “Receivables from subsidiaries” is shown below, compared with the previous year: The breakdown of receivables as at December 31, 2019 by geographical area is shown in the following table (art. 2427, first paragraph, no. 6, of the Italian Civil Code). Receivables are recorded at their presumed realisable value which corresponds to the difference between the nominal value of the receivables and the adjustments recognised in the provision for credit risks, recorded in the financial statements as a direct reduction of the assets to which they refer. The amount of these adjustment funds is commensurate with the extent of the risk of non-collection prudentially estimated on the amounts of receivables accrued for academic years prior to 19/20 for which there is a recoverability risk.

The item Other reserves includes the Reserve for operating surpluses before the conversion; it was formed as a result of the operating surpluses of the non-commercial entity up to December 31, 2018. Compared to the previous year, the item decreased by € 1,200,000, due to the recognition of the share capital and of the legal reserve at the date of the conversion and it increased due to the carry-forward of the 2018 result. The profit of the fiscal year as at December 31, 2019 of € 6,203,682 is made up as follows: i) € 3,757,841 relating to the portion from January 1, 2019 to June 24, 2019 (pre-conversion period); ii) € 2,445,841 relating to the portion from June 25, 2019 to December 31, 2019 (post-conversion period).

Also taking into account the indications from operating practices, it was considered appropriate to draw up a balance sheet on the effective date of the conversion (June 25, 2019), in order to ascertain the value of the balance sheet components on the same date and the shareholders’ equity of the changing body. From a tax point of view, given the provisions of art. 171 of the TUIR, applicable to heterogeneous conversion operations (progressive and regressive) and to the practice documents published by the Revenue Agency (Resolution no. 102/2009), there is the need to carry out an extraordinary survey of the income realised on the date the conversion is considered to be completed, in consideration of the different quantification and qualification regime of the tax base applicable to the pre- (non-commercial) and post-conversion (commercial, and consequent classification in the business income category).

With subsequent acts and implementing provisions, starting from March 2020, universities and AFAM institutions were entitled, in the exercise of their autonomy, to prioritise alternative remote methods, progress examinations, including graduation sessions, which can be carried out using remote access methods. These provisions, if reasonably confirmed also following the resolution of the COVID outbreak, constitute a change of epic proportions in the processes on which traditional teaching is based, contributing in a dramatic manner to the promotion of a modern and indeed more democratic and global university education, functional to the creation of a ‘Global University’ with the same technology, philosophy, values and methods able to make students feel at home in every university in the various countries of the world and allow the creation of multiple learning, interdisciplinary and multicultural channels.

In addition: - we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the university financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control; - we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors; - we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the University’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this matter in forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the University to cease to continue as a going concern; we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the university financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the university financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

625_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1230,IRAP,1230.53,"Notes to the Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 1. Introduction",1230.53.1,,"In the preparation of these financial statements as at December 31, 2018, we have complied with the accounting standards and the schedules attached to Interministerial Decree No. 19 of 14 January 2014 (hereinafter also referred to as “ID” for convenience) which definitively implemented Italian Legislative Decree No. 18 of January 27, 2012, approved in the framework of amendments provided by the “Gelmini” reform (Law No. 240 of 30 December 2012) and which introduced, for all universities, the obligation to keep an economic and financial accounting system and the preparation of individual single financial statements for the year. As established by article 1, paragraph 3, of the aforementioned ID, in drawing up this document, we have also taken into account, for all that is not expressly sanctioned by the decree itself, the provisions of the Italian Civil Code (Article 2423 and following) and the national accounting standards issued by the Italian Accounting Organisation (OIC) and adapted by the latter to the new provisions of Italian Legislative Decree No. 139/2015 approved in accordance with EU directive 34/13. In adoption of the ID, the financial statements presented below contain some items no longer envisaged by the Balance Sheet and Income Statement formats envisaged by Art. 2424 and 2425 of the Italian Civil Code (Memorandum Accounts in the Balance Sheet, Extraordinary Management in the Income Statement) and the Cash Flow Statement defined by OIC 10, following the changes introduced by the Italian Legislative Decree No. 139/2015. Furthermore, with the clarifications set out below, the indications contained in the technical-operational manual issued with a new update on July 26, 2017 (Protocol No. 0001841), by the Commission for the economic and financial accounting of Universities provided for by the Art. 9 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 18 of January 27, 2012 and in accordance with the provisions of Art. 8 of the ID. The document that is submitted for your examination corresponds to the results of the accounting records regularly kept by the University and is made up of the following documents: - Balance Sheet; - Income Statement; - Cash Flow Statement; - Explanatory Notes. It should be noted that: - the balance sheet, the income statement and the cash flow statement are prepared in Euro units. The transition from account balances, expressed in Euro cents, to the financial statements balances, expressed in Euro units, took place by rounding up or down. The balancing of the financial statements was ensured by summarising the differentials of the balance sheet in a “Reserve for rounding into Euro units”, recorded under item “Other reserves” and those of the income statement, alternatively, in “Extraordinary income” or “Extraordinary expenses”; - the data in the explanatory notes are expressed in Euro units as they guarantee a better intelligibility of the document. It should be noted that, starting from the 2018 fiscal year, with a just resolution of the Board of Directors of 12 June 2018, adopted in line with the University mission and with the University’s statutory provisions, the University brought forward the duration of the academic year previously scheduled for the period from October 1 to September 30 to the period August 1st to July 31. Consequently, the allocation of accrued revenues and deferred income for the year ended December 31, 2018 takes into account the new period of duration of the academic year and this aspect must be considered when comparing the income from teaching in 2018 with those of previous year. Specifically, teaching income was recognised for a period of approximately nine months for the 2017-2018 academic year, in line with the 20162017 academic year for the 2017 fiscal year, and five months of income for the academic year 2018-2019, compared to three months of the academic year 2017-2018 recognised in 2017. It is emphasised that the change in duration of the Academic Year, dictated exclusively by educational reasons, has allowed working students to extend the time span of study opportunities and will continue to do so in future.

The rate used to discount future flows is the market rate. In the case of receivables arising from commercial transactions, the difference between the initial recognition value thus determined and the forward value is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in revenues, generating a financial income over the duration of the receivable using the effective interest rate criterion. In the case of financial receivables, the difference between the cash and cash equivalents disbursed or collected and the present value of future cash flows, determined using the market interest rate, is recognised under financial income or expense in the income statement at the time of initial recognition, unless the substance of the transaction or contract leads to the attribution of a different nature to this component. Subsequently, the interest income or expense accruing on the transaction is calculated at the effective interest rate and charged to the income statement with an offsetting entry against the value of the receivable or payable. If the financial credit is disbursed to a subsidiary and from the available evidence it can be inferred that the nature of the transaction is the strengthening of the subsidiary’s equity, the effect deriving from the application of the amortised cost criterion is recognised as an increase in the value of the investment, instead of under financial charges in the income statement. application of indices established by current legislation, and the amount is recognised gross of the advance payment required by Art. 3 of Law No. 662/96 and subsequent amendments.

The recoverable value of an asset is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and its value in use determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows. An impairment is recognised if the recoverable value is lower than the book value.
