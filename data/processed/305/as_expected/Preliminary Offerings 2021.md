**Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers,**
the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this offering circular has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for
such securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and
(ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of each**
manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this offering circular has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business
Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”) (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors: The securities described in this offering circular are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129
(as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling such securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has
been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling such securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors: The securities described in this offering circular are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”).

(EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the “FSMA”), and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the
Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of UK
MiFIR; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
(the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling such securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been
prepared and, therefore, offering or selling such securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful
under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

You should rely only on, and base your decision to invest in the notes solely on, the information contained
in this offering circular. None of the issuers, the guarantors, any of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., ING
Financial Markets LLC, Mizuho Securities USA LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc., SG Americas Securities, LLC
or Truist Securities, Inc. (the “USD initial purchasers”) or any of Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, Credit
Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Securities
(USA) Inc., ING Bank N.V., Mizuho Securities Europe GmbH, MUFG Securities EMEA plc, Société Générale or

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about        , 2021,
which is the      business day following the date of the pricing of the notes (such settlement cycle being referred to
as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes prior to the date that is two business
days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+    ,
to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the
notes who wish to trade the notes during such period should consult their own advisors.

The notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the notes will be issued in the form of
one or more registered global notes. The issuers expect that the notes offered and sold in the United States to qualified
institutional buyers in reliance upon Rule 144A will initially be represented by beneficial interests in one or more
permanent global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached. The issuers expect that the notes offered
and sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by
beneficial interests in one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached. The global notes
representing the USD notes will be deposited with the applicable Trustee as custodians for DTC as depositary, and
registered in the name of Cede & Co. or another nominee of such depositary. The global notes representing the nonUSD notes will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream. Beneficial interests in the global notes will be
shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global notes will be effected only through, records maintained by
DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. After the initial issuance of the global notes, certificated
notes will be issued in exchange for global notes only in the limited circumstances set forth in the indentures that will
govern the secured notes and the unsecured notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

There is currently no public market for the notes. Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of
the non-USD notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the non-USD notes will be

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL DATA**

**_Historical Financial Information_**

This offering circular contains the audited consolidated financial statements of Allied Universal Holdco LLC
and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. This financial
information has been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

On April 6, 2021, we completed the acquisition of G4S plc (“G4S,” and such acquisition, the “G4S
Acquisition”). This offering circular contains the audited consolidated financial statements of G4S and its subsidiaries
as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. This financial information has been
prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK
Companies Act 2006 and with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No
1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (“IFRS”), and are presented in pound sterling, and therefore is not
readily comparable to the audited financial statements of Allied Universal Holdco LLC, which have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP and have been presented in US dollars.

**_Pro Forma Financial Information_**

We also present in this offering circular certain unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information,
including:

    - the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations of Allied Universal for the year
ended December 31, 2020; and

    - the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet of Allied Universal as of December 31,
2020.

The unaudited pro forma statement of operations combines the historical statements of operations of Allied
Universal and G4S for the year ended December 31, 2020 and gives effect to the G4S Acquisition and related financing
transactions as if such transactions occurred on January 1, 2020. The historical financial information has been adjusted
to give effect to pro forma adjustments that address differences in reporting currencies, differences in bases of
accounting, and differences in the classification and presentation of certain financial information, and shows the effects
of the adoption of certain accounting standards. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet combines the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of Allied Universal and G4S as of December 31, 2020 and gives effect to the G4S
Acquisition and related financing transactions as if such transactions occurred on December 31, 2020. For a detailed
description of the basis of presentation with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information, see “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on available information and
certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The assumptions and estimates underlying the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information are described in the accompanying notes thereto, which should be read
together with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be
indicative of the financial condition or results of operations that we would have reported had the G4S Acquisition


-----

actually occurred during the periods and as of the dates presented, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information does not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition as of any future date
or for any future period. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has not been prepared
in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act or the Prospectus Regulation. Neither the
assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information have been audited or reviewed. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information” for more information on the basis of preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Use of Proceeds,”
“Capitalization” and the historical financial statements of Allied Universal and G4S included elsewhere in this offering
circular and the accompanying notes thereto.

**_Rounding_**

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering circular, including financial data presented in millions or in
thousands, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this offering circular,
may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. In addition, as a result of such rounding, the
totals of certain financial information presented in tabular form may differ from the information that would have
appeared in such totals using the unrounded financial information.

**NON-GAAP AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES**

In addition to the financial information presented in this offering circular prepared in accordance with GAAP
or IFRS, as applicable, this offering circular contains “non-GAAP financial measures” and “non-IFRS financial
measures,” that is, financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the
most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or IFRS, as applicable. We
present Allied Adjusted EBITDA, G4S Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted Revenue as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in
accordance with GAAP or IFRS, as applicable. We define Allied Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before
interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude
certain non-cash items and certain cash expenses management considers non-recurring, unusual or otherwise not
indicative of our ongoing operating performance and to reflect the full expected effect of cost reduction and profitenhancing initiatives, acquisitions, disposals and related cost and revenue synergies. Specific adjustments for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 include adjustments for transaction, integration and restructuring costs,
sponsor and director fees, non-cash equity-based compensation, legal settlements and related fees, certain adjustments
related to the implementation of Allied Universal’s accounting standards, loss on disposal of property and equipment,
loss on early extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on disposal of businesses, and miscellaneous other non-recurring
adjustments, as further adjusted to give effect to start-up costs and lease costs, profit-improvement initiatives,
unrealized synergies from certain acquired businesses, management’s estimates of EBITDA from certain acquired
businesses generated prior to their acquisition date, management’s estimates of EBITDA from certain businesses
acquired in 2021, profits related to disposed businesses, and other non-recurring adjustments, which are described in
the section entitled “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.”
We define G4S Adjusted EBITDA as profit / (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense and
depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items and certain cash expenses
management considers non-recurring, unusual or otherwise not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
Specific adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 include adjustments for transaction and
integration costs, director fees, non-cash equity-based compensation, legal settlements and related fees, loss (gain) on
disposal of property and equipment, loss (gain) on contingent consideration, certain IFRS adjustments, start-up costs,
lease costs, management’s estimates of EBITDA related to disposed businesses, constant currency exchange rate
adjustments and other non-recurring adjustments described in the section entitled “Summary—Summary Historical
Consolidated Financial Information of G4S.” Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA has been determined based on
the combined statements of operations of Allied Universal and G4S for the year ended December 31, 2020 as adjusted
as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” and as further adjusted to
reflect certain non-recurring adjustments and unrealized synergies in connection with the Financing Transactions and


-----

G4S Acquisition as described under “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Combined
Financial Information.” We define Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenue as Allied Universal’s historical revenue,
as adjusted to give effect to businesses acquired during 2020 and 2021 by Allied Universal, plus G4S’s historical
revenue, as adjusted to give effect to revenue from businesses held for sale by G4S, onerous contracts, revenue from
businesses disposed of by G4S during 2020 and 2021 and constant currency exchange rate adjustments. You are
encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In
evaluating these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses
that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP
and non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual
or non-recurring item.

We present these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures because we believe they assist management and
investors when analyzing our performance by providing meaningful information that facilitates the comparability of
underlying business results from period to period. We recognize these measures are not measurements of financial
performance under GAAP and IFRS and there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP and non-IFRS
financial measures. Some of these limitations are:

    - other companies may use different methods to calculate similar non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures, and
the measures we present may not be directly comparable with the measures presented by these other
companies as a result;

    - such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

    - such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to
service interest payments, on our debts; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges,
the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these
measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;

    - non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation
package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for
a particular period;

    - such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not
to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

    - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

Allied Adjusted EBITDA, G4S Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA are adjusted
to reflect certain acquisitions and certain unrealized acquisition synergies anticipated to be achieved in connection
therewith. We present these adjustments as they will be permitted as adjustments to “EBITDA” under the indentures
that will govern the notes offered hereby, although the non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures included herein may be
defined differently than the corresponding terms under such indentures, and to enable investors to understand the
covenants that will apply to us, and not as a projection of future results. We will be required to make cash expenditures
to achieve such cost savings, and these cash costs are not reflected in Allied Adjusted EBITDA, G4S Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we will not fully realize such cost savings within
12 months of the completion of this notes offering, and may not do so at all. Accordingly, you should not view our
presentation of this adjustment as a projection that we will achieve these acquisition synergies. Our ability to realize
these acquisition synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the
adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—
We may not realize the expected benefits, revenue or cost synergies related to recently completed or future
acquisitions” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the G4S Acquisition—We may fail to realize all of the anticipated


-----

benefits of the G4S Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter
significant difficulties in integrating the G4S business.”

Because of these limitations, non-GAAP and non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in
isolation or as substitutes for, or as superior to, the presentation of results determined in accordance with GAAP and
IFRS, as applicable. For a reconciliation of Allied Adjusted EBITDA, G4S Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP and/or IFRS financial measures, see
“Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Combined Financial Information” and “Summary—
Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information of G4S.”

**Our Company**

**Business Overview**

Allied Universal is North America’s leading security and facility services provider. With over 250,000
security professionals and offices located throughout the United States as well as internationally (Canada, Mexico,
and the United Kingdom), Allied Universal serves approximately 14,800 clients and is responsible for protecting more
than 50,000 client sites covering multiple specialty sectors such as higher education, healthcare, retail, commercial
real estate, government, and corporate campuses, including a significant portion of the Fortune 500 companies. Allied
Universal’s services span manned guarding, innovative technology systems, risk and consulting, janitorial and staffing
services, integration services, and digital solutions and remote monitoring.

We are responsible for providing “best-in-class” security services that allow clients to completely outsource
the recruiting, screening, hiring, training, uniforming, scheduling and supervision of security officers. Our security
officers work on-location at customer sites and are responsible for observing, detecting, deterring and reporting and
responding to perceived, potential or actual security threats. We also provide specialized security services such as
vehicle patrol, visitor management, K-9 security services, top security facility cleared security professionals, and joint
security programs. We have an operational presence in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and
have a growing presence in Canada, Latin America, and the United Kingdom.

In addition to providing manned guarding services, we provide comprehensive technology solutions to our
customers, including video surveillance, closed circuit television (“CCTV”) picture capture and monitoring, robot
patrolling, GPS-based patrol and reporting, management of access control points and centralized security operations.
We also offer systems integration services to design, install and service fully integrated technology-based monitoring
systems, along with digital solutions and remote monitoring through our Monitoring and Response Center (“MaRC”).
We are able to leverage our large manned guarding customer base and service platform to cross-sell these additional
system integration services. Finally, we offer a range of ancillary services, including temporary and permanent
staffing, event staffing and security, janitorial services, and consulting and investigation solutions.

Allied Universal was formed in August 2016 through the combination of AlliedBarton Security Services
(“AlliedBarton”) and Universal Services of America (“Universal”), which brought together two of the leading
providers in the security services industry. AlliedBarton, founded in 1957, and Universal, founded in 1965, were
leaders in the industry in customer service, organic growth, customer and employee retention, accretive mergers and
acquisitions (“M&A”), and had a highly complementary and diverse set of blue chip customers. The combined
company became the largest provider of security officer services in North America and has continued to grow since,
both organically and through M&A. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Allied Universal acquired U.S. Security Associates
Holdings, Inc., a leading North American provider of security solutions, including manned security, consulting,
investigations, and disaster and emergency response services. Since 2007, the company has successfully executed 72
acquisitions, including small and large tuck-ins. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Allied announced the acquisition of

SOS Security, LLC (“SOS Security”) which brought a complementary approach and further scale to Allied Universal.
As of 2020, Allied Universal has an estimated 31% share of the highly fragmented outsourced manned guarding
security services market in the United States, with a track record of growth driven both organically and through
acquisitions.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we had
Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenues of $18,357.1 million and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA of
$1,955.9 million, respectively. See “—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Combined Financial
Information” for a reconciliation of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenues and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA to revenues and net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP and/or IFRS measures.

**G4S Acquisition**

On December 8, 2020, the governing boards of Allied Universal and of G4S announced that they had reached
agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer, to be made by Atlas UK Bidco Limited (“Allied Bidco”), a
newly incorporated entity that is indirectly controlled by Allied Universal, to acquire the entire issued and to be issued
share capital of G4S, with G4S’ directors recommending Allied Universal’s offer of 245 pence per share, representing
a purchase price of approximately £3.8 billion and total enterprise value of approximately £5.4 billion (the “G4S
Offer”). On March 16, 2021, we announced the offer becoming unconditional as to acceptances, having received valid
acceptances representing approximately 79% of total G4S shares. On April 6, 2021, the G4S Offer became wholly
unconditional, and we completed the G4S Acquisition.

**G4S Overview**

G4S is a leading global security company, specializing in the provision of security services and solutions to
customers around the world. G4S’s roots can be traced back approximately 120 years ago to 1901, when the guarding
company Kjøbenhavn Frederiksberg Nattevagt was established in Denmark. Since then, G4S has expanded both
organically and through acquisitions, culminating in the merger of Securicor and Group 4 Falck to create G4S in 2004.
G4S is active in 90 countries across the globe, has more than 490,000 security professionals, and purchases goods and
services from approximately 40,000 suppliers. G4S has security integration capabilities in more than 40 key markets
and more than 13,000 monitored end points with key markets across the Americas, Africa, Asia and EMEA. Key
services include system design, integration & maintenance, manned & mobile guarding, monitoring & response,
consultancy & risk management, analytics, equipment and software. G4S provides its services to a broad range of
customers across various types of sites, including Fortune 500 companies, construction sites and manufacturing
facilities, hospital campuses and healthcare facilities, oil, gas, energy and other regulated facilities, financial
institutions and banking centers, college and university campuses, courthouses and government buildings, law
enforcement support including detainee processing and transport, and gated and residential communities.

Through its Secure Solutions segment, G4S is a global market leader in security, providing both traditional
manned-guarding and technology-enabled security solutions in addition to consultancy services and analytics to its
customers. G4S uses its expertise, service delivery and integration alongside its geographic scale to differentiate the
business to customers, drive outsourcing and enhance the value of traditional security services through greater use of
technology. G4S officers are tailored for the specific need of each client, including the following: custom protection
officers who meet stringent experience and training requirements and are prepared to step into high profile locations;
upscale security officers who perform security patrols of designated areas on foot or in a vehicle; lobby ambassadors
who present a professional and courteous appearance while also possessing customer service skills and focus and bank
protection officers who provide visible deterrence of criminal activity at entrances of financial institutions and banking
centers. Currently, technology-enabled security services represent approximately 45% of Secure Solutions revenue.
G4S is focused on pivoting from manned guarding to “predictive” security services with consulting, technology,
people and data analytics to continue margin expansion going forward.

G4S’ Cash Solutions segment is comprised of the Retail Technology Solutions and Conventional Cash
divisions. On February 26, 2020, G4S announced it agreed to sell the majority of its Conventional Cash businesses to
Brink’s for cash consideration of £666 million, allowing it to focus on the growth of its core integrated security
solutions business and further develop the rapidly growing Retail Technology Solutions business. Retail Technology
Solutions provides unique, value-add cash management solutions to clients and goes to market through the brands


-----

Retail Cash Solutions, CASH360, Desposita, G4SPay, and South Africa-Deposits. G4S technologies offer a breadth
of solutions to clients including automated cash management and reconciliation and unique forecasting tools for retail
cash operations. Conventional Cash services include armored cash transportation, typically facilitated between cash
centers and customer outlets, as well as counterfeit detection, cash redistribution to banks and ATMs, ATM
management, including cash forecasting, replenishment, reconciliation and maintenance, counting and secure
international transportation of cash and valuables including, but not limited to, currency, gems and precious metals.

**Strategic Rationale**

**Enhances the combined company’s geographic coverage and capabilities to serve customers, especially in the**
**core North America market, which represents approximately 70% of pro forma combined revenues**

We believe the G4S acquisition is a strategically and financially compelling transaction that will expand our
geographic footprint, enhance our scale, diversify our products and services offering, increase market position and
provide new growth channels in untapped regions and end-markets. The acquisition of G4S provides Allied Universal
with a unique opportunity to acquire a well-established integrated security services company with a globally
recognized security services brand, and platform to increase the combined company’s top line sales and profitability.
Allied Universal and G4S are two of the top five global companies in the highly fragmented security services industry
based on revenue. Together, we will be a global leading company in the security services.

The transaction enhances the combined company’s geographic coverage and capabilities to serve customers,
especially in the core North America market, which represents approximately 70% of pro forma combined revenues.
Allied Universal has a strong footprint in North America with a presence in all 50 states, and the merger with G4S
creates unparalleled scale and increases density, with footprint overlap allowing the combined company to take a bestof approach to servicing clients in the various regions. Based on revenue generation, we rank number one in Manned
Guarding and Retail Technology solutions and number three in Security Technology in North America. We provide
a comprehensive, diverse product offering with value-added services and world-class quality to our end-customers.
We believe our increased scale in multiple regions and the breadth of our services will make our services more
attractive to our customers. Both Allied Universal and G4S provide diversified solutions in addition to traditional
manned guarding services. The Allied Universal and G4S transaction creates a fully integrated security business with
the ability to address customers’ evolving security needs in an increasingly evolving and fast-changing world with
increased demand.

**Increases diversification across end-markets, customers and geographies**

While Allied Universal has historically focused more on the North American region, the acquisition of G4S
enables Allied Universal to significantly increase its global footprint and diversify its base to operating in over 90
countries. The combination with G4S establishes Allied Universal as a global security services leader with unmatched
scale and expertise in providing quality security services across a range of geographies. The combination of Allied
Universal’s and G4S’s solutions and significant manned-guarding businesses will create a global one-stop-shop for
customers and a business ideally positioned to lead the industry shift from traditional security officer and patrol
services towards services that integrate technology solutions with manned security services. See “—Industry
Overview—Security Services Technology.” Allied Universal’s decades of experience in risk advisory and consulting,
investigations, executive protection and emergency response will complement G4S’s corporate risk services to provide
end-to-end security solutions. With appropriate support, capital and assistance from Allied Universal, G4S would be
able to concentrate on addressing the ongoing industry shift towards electronic and technology-based services.

**Strengthens platform with blue chip customer base**

The combination of Allied Universal and G4S will create a world-leading integrated security business
providing services to an extensive portfolio of blue-chip clients across the public and private sectors. We sell to a
diversified customer base and end-markets in various verticals, including commercial real estate, retail and malls,
government, healthcare, tech and media, manufacturing and industrial, financial institution, chemical and
petrochemical, and aerospace and defense. We are the trusted provider to premium accounts for clients with greater
than $5 million annual revenue across multiple regions and a central point of contact for purchasing security services.
Our leading global scale helps promote trust and confidence among our sophisticated customers and serves as a


-----

significant differentiator versus regional competitors. The combination expands Allied Universal’s base of long
tenured blue chip customers globally and uniquely positions the combined company to serve customers seeking
integrated security solutions providers of scale. Allied Universal has had annual revenue retention of over 90% for the
past 5 years and has minimal customer concentration with top five customers representing less than 5% of revenues.
Doing business and negotiating long-term contracts through a centralized procurement division drives strong valueadded partnerships underpinned by highly sticky relationships, which increase the switching costs for our customers.

**Acquisition adds density and expertise to North America technology business**

The combined group will increase Allied Universal’s reach and depth of services, enhancing our leadership
position and allowing us to expand internationally on current domestic accounts. While Allied Universal has an
established customer base with significant density in traditional manned-guarding services, G4S will contribute to our
operational scale in Retail Cash solutions and Retail Technology solutions, which have grown since launching in 2015.
We see this as a new services platform, especially in our security technology services that we can cross-sell with North
American customers and improve Allied Universal’s services coverage. The expansion of Allied Universal’s
technology services platform capabilities will enable the combined company to offer superior client service, with
greater breadth, accountability, improved efficiency and cost savings. We have competitive advantages through strong
trajectory relative to competitors and potential disruptors and we transfer our knowledge and experience in the United
States to deploy our abilities to compete in adjacent markets.

**Meaningful cost synergy opportunity**

We intend to deploy operational and strategic best practices across Allied Universal and G4S to drive
additional growth, enable cross-selling capabilities, enhance operational performance and increase free cash flow
conversion. We estimate that the combination will unlock approximately $155 million in targeted annual cost savings
once G4S is fully integrated and our cost savings initiatives have been fully implemented. Allied Universal has a
strong track record of successful acquisition integration, including synergy realization. We anticipate that our
disciplined management of fixed and variable operating expenses, revenue and financing synergies, as well as
corporate overhead and headcount rationalization will primarily drive cost synergies. Historically, we have made a
significant number of acquisitions and we have well-developed systems and processes throughout our organization to
support integration efforts, resulting in more efficient synergy realization and helping drive overall margin
improvement.

The overlapping business functions in North America provide a significant opportunity for real estate and
personnel rationalization. Due to overlapping operations, we expect significant synergies in the following areas in the
North America region: general and administrative expenses, duplicative service contracts, insurance, and facilities
expense. Additionally, we will be able to eliminate any expenses in functional support areas that support G4S’s status
as a public listed company. Further, we believe opportunities exist to increase operating leverage through
diversification across investment in capabilities, such as additional training and technology deployments.

**Industry Overview**

**Market Overview**

The global contract security services market is large, has been stable and is expected to continue its consistent
growth supported by a number of favorable trends. The US security services market was estimated to generate
approximately $66 billion in revenue in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 4% to 5% compound annual growth rate
(“CAGR”) from 2021 to 2025. The US security services market for outsourced manned guarding generated over $28
billion in revenue in 2020 and grew at a 4.3% CAGR from 2017 to 2020. The security technology market in the US
is also large, with revenues estimated to be approximately $17 billion in 2020, and grew slightly quicker than the
manned guarding segment, at a CAGR of approximately 8% from 2017 to 2020. The market was estimated to be
comprised of approximately 42% manned guarding and 25% security technology. Internationally, the security services
market for manned guarding grew to $34 billion in revenue in 2020 and is expected to reach approximately $40 billion
in revenue in 2025, representing an estimated compound annual growth rate of 5% from 2021 to 2025.


-----

A heightened focus on security, both in the United States and globally, has been driven by high profile gun
violence, domestic terrorism events, a rise in workplace incidents and both peaceful and violent protest events, which
have led to increased spending on security. Our service offerings represent an important first line of defense against
potential security threats. Meanwhile, mega trends occurring around the world and positive growth tailwinds in the
distribution, manufacturing, healthcare and education sectors also support demand for increasing security. In addition,
organizations continue to outsource their security services primarily to alleviate administrative burdens and achieve
cost savings, while the compelling value proposition delivered through scale, broad service offerings and robust
technological infrastructure drive them to shift to highly professionalized providers.

Given the high-risk exposure of inadequate security, we believe that customers make purchasing decisions
based on service quality, reliability, and reputation, rather than price alone. It has been our experience that customers
seek out and maintain long-term relationships with quality providers. For example, industry switching rates have
historically been between 10% to 15% on average annually, and customer retention rates are higher for large customers
served under national contracts, according to a third party consulting study. Meanwhile, Allied Universal, as a scale
provider, experienced below average annual customer switching rates of between 5% to 10%.

We believe the industry’s stability in various economic cycles is underpinned by the recession-resistant
nature of security services, resulting in limited cyclicality and customer churn. Over a ten-year period, industry growth
has been consistent, and historically recession-resistant, experiencing only one year of flat-to-slightly declining
growth. The impact of economic downturns on labor markets, which includes higher employee retention, and
subsequently lower unbilled overtime, recruiting and training costs, historically have led to EBITDA margin
expansion, which has historically been sustained during a return to economic expansion. Our experience during 2020
demonstrates the resiliency of our business model. Despite lockdowns and office closures during the COVID
pandemic, security services remained an essential part of real estate management and asset protection. During this
period, we also experienced a temporary shift in demand from security services in connection with retail, travel and
leisure to grocery and other essential businesses. We also experienced an increase in demand for higher value-add
services such as temperature screening. During the summer of 2020, protests and other civil events drove demand for
our manned guarding services, providing further diversification and resiliency against office closings.

US Outsourced Security Guard Industry

($ in billions)

**Market Drivers**

The US security services and security technology integration and manned guarding market is expected to
grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2021 through 2025. Several positive trends support this growth, including:
(i) baseline expansion from building stock growth, guard penetration in existing buildings, and wage rate growth
which is passed on through the mark-up model used to price security services; (ii) secular demand growth due to
heightened focus on security driven by increased acts of violence and media coverage, increasing regulatory and
insurance scrutiny; and (iii) increased outsourcing rate for security services. Furthermore, there is a trend toward the
centralization of security programs and integration of manned guarding with technology solutions, both of which favor
best-in-class national providers. As the national player with vertical markets expertise and differentiated integrated
security and technology solutions, we are well-positioned to benefit from favorable industry tailwinds.


-----

Globally, demand for security services has also increased steadily and is expected to grow at a CAGR of
4.9% between 2020 and 2024. Demand is driven by similar factors as in the United States as well as elevated safety
and security risks and concerns driven by geopolitical events such as refuge crises, increased wealth driven by
urbanization, global GDP growth, rising labor costs supporting demand for higher-value, technology-enabled,
integrated security solutions and demand for higher-value service lines driven by more advanced technology
capabilities.

The COVID pandemic demonstrated the industry’s resilience as the global security services market continued
to experience growth despite lockdowns throughout much of the world.

**Base-Line Industry Growth**

Base-line industry growth is driven by underlying economic growth, growing wage rates and increasing
building stock, as each new building adds incremental demand for the security services industry. While building stock
growth provides strong underlying support for the security services market, it is not necessary to sustain growth within
our existing customer bases. A growing economy drives up overall wage rates, increases statutory minimum wages
and provides union increases, all which are typically passed on to customers through a stable mark-up. Increased wage
rates are expected to continue driving further expansion of the manned guarding market and increase revenue
generation from existing clients.

**Growing Demand for Security Services**

Security services remain critical and non-discretionary as customers overwhelmingly value the role of
security officers in deterring criminal activity and other incidents, all the while providing assurance against real or
perceived security threats. In cases of security incidents, customers value the officers’ ability to provide immediate
response. Technology can enhance and significantly improve security but we believe there is no substitute for the
physical presence of well-trained and dedicated security personnel who can respond to threats in real-time.

The demand for security services continues to increase due to heightened security concerns stemming from
the ongoing threat of terrorism and high profile gun violence, large protest events, heightened importance of public
and workplace safety, refugee crises and the growing need to supplement services provided by the public sector.
Heightened media coverage of security lapses, growing costs of disruption, and stricter security requirements by
government institutions and private insurers have forced organizations to take greater responsibility for their own
security.

**Increased Outsourcing to Third-party Providers with National and Global Scale**

Currently, approximately 65% of manned security services in the United States are outsourced to professional
security services firms, and this outsourcing rate is expected to increase incrementally over time. The trend toward
outsourcing is expected to continue to drive growth in the industry due to the strong value proposition of contract
security service providers and non-core nature of security for the vast majority of companies.

Due to the growing complexity surrounding security-related issues and increased demand for vertical
segment expertise and customized guarding services, outsourcing security services to “best-in-class” providers
continues to be an attractive option for customers. Contract security services firms can offer customers improved
security, reduced non-core administrative burden, and competitive pricing through operating leverage, each of which
are compelling reasons supporting the trend toward outsourcing various business services. Outsourcing of non-core
functions has not only become a corporate best practice, but also a function of the public sector as governments look
to minimize cost. Outsourcing allows companies and governments to reduce labor costs and shift the administrative
burden of non-core functions to third-party vendors with more experience, operating leverage, and functional area
expertise.

As one of the few security and facility services providers with national and global scale, we believe the
combined Allied Universal and G4S business is well-positioned to benefit from the trend toward outsourcing security
services. For example, we are able to address customers’ increasingly complex security needs and their preference for


-----

best-in-class providers with strong reputations and vertical markets expertise, rather than local providers. In addition,
as national customers increasingly seek to consolidate vendors, they build relationships with national partners that can
reliably and consistently serve them across multiple regions. Finally, the increased centralization of procurement
continues to drive the shift in customer decision-making from a local level to a multi-region and national level,
providing an opportunity for national providers to increase customer penetration.

**Security Services Technology**

Due to the importance of having security officers physically present to deter and quickly respond to incidents,
technology has been used primarily to enhance and better enable manned security services. Security services providers
such as Allied Universal and G4S continue to broaden their portfolio of services by combining value-added offerings
like access controls, ID verification, video monitoring, and communications systems with traditional security officer
and patrol services. Customers seek integration between manned guarding services and complementary technology
solutions in order to improve and reduce the complexity of their security operations. Existing customer relationships
create the ability to cross-sell services for the installation, integration and maintenance of physical technology systems
that augment manned guarding services. Integrated technology solutions enhance the value delivered to customers
and foster customer retention. They provide a recurring revenue model for providers, as they require one-time sales
and installations but involve regular system services and maintenance.

**Industry Consolidation**

Over the past eight years, the contract security services industry has consolidated through increased M&A
activity. Given the sustained fragmented nature of the industry, this trend is expected to continue in the near to
intermediate term. Reflecting the strong customer preference for national and increasingly global scale providers and
the operational and cost advantages of having local density, large contract security services providers continue to gain
market share. Together, Allied Universal and G4S will hold a leading market position and we expect to further growth
market share in the security services industry in the United States and globally in connection with the business
combination.

**Competitive Strengths**

**Largest Security Services Provider Worldwide**

Following the G4S Acquisition, Allied Universal has become the global leader in security services and the
acquisition reinforced our number one position in North America. Combined with G4S, we increased our scale and
density, further enhancing our ability to deliver consistent, high quality services across our operations infrastructure.


-----

We have achieved industry-leading growth over the last decade through both organic and accretive M&A
activities. We serve a significant portion of Fortune 500 companies, and generated Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
Revenues of $18,357.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. See “—Summary Historical Consolidated and
Pro Forma Combined Financial Information” for a reconciliation of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenues to
revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP and/or IFRS measure. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, we employ approximately 740,000 security professionals and operate in more than 225 locations in all
50 US states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and have a growing presence in Canada, Brazil, Colombia,
Peru, Argentina, Chile, Benelux, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, UAE, India, Australia, Thailand, Hong Kong, South
Africa, Morocco and Kenya.

Our national scale also enables us to serve strategic industry verticals such as high-rise offices, aerospace
and defense, higher education and healthcare. With the acquisition of G4S, Allied Universal has significant density in
local markets in the United States and regional markets worldwide, which drives a competitive advantage in serving
our customers, providing a location-specific approach with the benefits of a global platform. Our local density enables
us to serve a wide range of client sizes while achieving operational leverage at the branch level by keeping overhead
expenses as a percentage of revenue lower than the industry average.

Note: Shows hours per week (HPW) in each region before and after the G4S Acquisition.

**Consistent, Recession-Resistant Industry**

The resilient nature of the security services market was demonstrated during the COVID pandemic, which
reaffirmed the essential nature of services provided by Allied Universal. Early in the pandemic, security professionals
were generally deemed essential by health authorities and continued to deliver security services to a range of
customers. Minor business disruptions at the onset of lockdowns led to a slight pullback in hours relative to the preCOVID period. Allied Universal has so far successfully managed the pandemic and performance has been highly
resilient both in top line growth and in margin expansion. Hours have since rebounded and even increased in some
regions as COVID-related restrictions have eased and economic activity continues to rebound, while increased
security concerns remain. Services have continued to expand as customers seek a partner to help implement and
execute new policies and procedures at guarded sites, in addition to offering additional services such as temperature
checks. An enhanced focus on innovative technology solutions drives further upside for security providers that offer
fully integrated solutions.

Allied Universal’s resilient top-line is driven by the contractual revenue streams with daily re-occurrence of
services, the critical nature of security to operations, and the low cost of security services relative to the high cost of
failure. The company typically benefits from rising wages as increases are passed on to clients, who generally expect
a 2% to 3% annual increase in billing rates, in-line with wage growth. Tightening labor markets result in stable
margins, while softer markets typically drive margin expansion as the increased supply of labor reduces the spread
between bill rates and employee pay rates.

**Compelling Growth Tailwinds in the United States and Across the Globe**

The critical and non-discretionary nature of security services to customers is driving stable, consistent growth
both in the United States and globally. The US security services market generated approximately $66 billion in revenue
in 2020, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2021 and 2025. Globally, the manned guarding market
generated approximately $34 billion in revenue in 2020, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% from 2021 to 2025.
The international technology security services market generated approximately $8 billion in revenue in 2020, and is
expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% from 2021 to 2025. Demand for high quality security services continues to grow
through heightened focus on security, increasing public safety awareness and the growing need to supplement services
provided by the public sector. The trend of outsourcing to high quality providers such as Allied Universal will continue
to be supported by a compelling value proposition, increasing security complexity and centralization of security
programs. There is a low risk of technology disruption as only manned security is considered an active deterrent to
perceived security threats. Further, technology solutions enhance rather than displace manned guarding and Allied
Universal provides customers with a best-in-class technology integrated service offering. These tailwinds, combined
with attractive end-market growth across diversified verticals, support attractive market growth across all key
geographies serviced by the combined company.

**Highly Diversified Revenue Mix Across High Growth Customer Base**

In the United States, Allied Universal has a highly diversified revenue mix across all major regions and
metropolitan areas, end markets, and customers. We have limited customer concentration, as our top 10 customers
account for 10.7% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, with no customer contributing more than 1.9%
of revenue during that period. Finally, we serve a variety of distinct vertical segments, none of which account for more
than 11% of revenue. This end market diversification shields us from industry-specific shocks and allows us to provide
vertical-specific solutions necessitated by the increasing complexity of security issues in different end markets. We
also benefit from our commercial real estate customers’ diverse tenant base and most of our mall clients being
considered “class A” (representing high sales per square foot), which achieve steadier foot traffic and higher guard
penetration.

The combined company will benefit from an expanded blue-chip client base, including a significant portion
of the Fortune 500, and vertical market clients, as well as a diversified revenue mix across North America, Asia
Pacific, Europe & Middle East, and Africa. The largest revenue mix by customer type is major corporate & industrial,
which accounted for roughly 21% of combined revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, followed by
government, with 13% of combined revenue, financial institutions, with 9% of combined revenue, retail and malls,
with 7% of combined revenue, technology, media and telecommunication, with 6% of combined revenue, commercial
real estate, with 6% of combined revenue, transportation and logistics, with 6% of combined revenue, chemical and
energy/utilities, with 6% of combined revenue, healthcare, with 5% of combined revenue, manufacturing and
industrial, with 3% of combined revenue, aerospace and defense, with 2% of combined revenue, and education, with
2% of combined revenue, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2020. This geographical and end-market
diversification provides us mobility to continue to grow revenue through multiple channels.

We have historically fostered long-term client relationships through our:

    - commitment to providing high-quality, responsive services;

    - active client service, sales and marketing efforts;

    - wide geographic scope and client-centric approach; and

    - consistent service offerings.

These characteristics are responsible for Allied Universal’s highly recurring client bases which have had over
90% revenue retention over the last 5 years.

Allied Universal additionally has a platform for serving premier customers in the United States, which we
define as clients with greater than $5 million of annual revenue across multiple regions and with a central point of
contact for purchasing security services. Our large national footprint in the United States and operational scale with
local density across the country enables us to be well-positioned to meet the needs of premier customers. We have a
contractual revenue base, with three to five year contracts for large customer accounts, and one-year evergreen
contracts for smaller accounts. We use a data-driven sales and account management process to take proactive measures
to expand and renew contracts well ahead of contract expiration.

**Premier Employer in the Industry with Better Than Industry Training and Employee Retention**

Client satisfaction is at the heart of our success and we rely on our employees to deliver consistent, highquality service. To ensure industry-leading service, we have cultivated a strong corporate culture that focuses on
personal career development and we reward long-term, quality service. We offer competitive compensation with
above-average security provider hourly wages, comprehensive training programs, career management tools,
leadership training and performance assessment processes for managers and executives to ensure that they are
attracting, engaging with, and retaining the highest quality security officers. We ensure that security professionals
have the appropriate training for each client need; for example, portions of our security professionals have military
service experience and CPR certification. Additionally, our commitment to the professional development of our
employees has resulted in 65% of managerial positions being filled through internal promotion. Lower employee
turnover rates reduce recruiting, screening, training costs and increases service quality for our customers, facilitating
long-term, stable relationships. Employee culture is also a key focus at G4S, where 84% of employees reported a
favorable view of the company in its 2019 global employee survey, with the results used to inform both local
engagement plans and company-wide initiatives.

In addition, Allied Universal has consistently been recognized for superior employee training and talent
development programs. Over the past several years, we received additional awards, including Chief Learning Officer
magazine’s LearningElite Award, The American Society for Training & Development Excellence in Practice Award,
Chief Executive Magazine’s Best Private Companies for Leaders Award, and Orange County Business Journal’s Best
Places to Work award.

Allied Universal’s digital employee engagement and safety solutions, including our proprietary Mercury
solution, provide consistent and reliable electronic communication channels with our approximately 250,000 security
professionals, ensuring collaborative interactions, including “on the clock” training, assignments delivery and
schedule modifications.

We have implemented an automated hiring and recruiting process, which includes an artificial intelligence
enhanced interview process and progresses applicants on a 24-7-365 basis. We use custom algorithms to qualify and
screen candidates based on top Allied Universal current security professionals, enabling managers and operators in
field to focus on client service rather than recruiting.

Finally, our proprietary business intelligence tool is utilized by thousands of managers in the business to
optimize pricing, staffing, safety and compliance.

**Stable and Predictable Financial Performance Coupled with Strong Free Cash Flow Generation**

_Consistent history of growth: Allied Universal has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to deliver growth,_
consistent and improving profitability, and strong cash flow. The nature of our customer contracts fosters a highly
visible financial model. Our recurring revenue base is supported by an above-average customer retention rate. To drive
revenue growth, both companies target new client wins, in particular the expansion of the premier customers portfolio
within Allied Universal, expanded scope of work and customer penetration with existing clients, added
complementary technology solutions, and consistent increases in price in line with wage rate growth and the delivery
of high- quality services. These organic growth drivers, coupled with our ability to execute upon accretive acquisition
opportunities, have contributed to strong revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth. From 2005 to 2020, Allied
Universal’s standalone organic revenue CAGR was approximately 6% and from 2017 to 2020, Allied Universal
consistently grew the spread between bill rates and wage rates per hour by approximately 4.5%. Allied Universal’s
disciplined acquisition strategy combined with strong organic growth has allowed us to become the fastest growing
security services company in the industry while maintaining strong free cash flow generation. The combination
between Allied Universal and G4S is expected to drive further topline and profitability growth through significant
cross-selling and cost synergy opportunities.

_Highly-variable cost structure drives predictable margins: Bill rate, which is the price we charge to our_
customers per hour per security officer, is priced as a mark-up on security officer pay rates, which is the wage we pay
to security guards per hour. From 2016 to 2020, Allied Universal’s mark-up has remained constant at 1.48x. This
stable mark-up reflects the strong track record of passing on cost increases to clients and expanding margins. Our
ability to pass through labor costs and other variable expenses to our clients allows us to generate consistent
profitability and produce cash flows with low volatility. This consistency helps us maintain stable operating margins
and provides a baseline level of profitability from which further margin expansion can be achieved as we continue to
increase our operating leverage and scale, while reducing general and administrative expenses.

_Capital-light business model supports strong cash flow: Our minimal capital requirements and strong_
working capital management support our strong cash flow profile. Capital expenditures over the past three years were
approximately 1.8% of annual revenue on average, with cash capital expenditures representing about half of such
capital expenditures and the remaining portion funded through capital leases. We also have minimal and predictable
net working capital needs, which provides further visibility into free cash flow.

**Proven Platform for Continued Organic Growth and Disciplined Approach to M&A**

We have demonstrated consistent growth, both organically and inorganically. We have historically grown
approximately 6% organically, driven by our best-in-class service offering, continued scale increase, technologically
advanced offerings and strong secular tailwinds. Utilizing a disciplined approach, we have demonstrated a strong track
record of sourcing, executing and integrating both tuck-in and transformative acquisitions. Through these acquisitions,
we have achieved meaningful cost synergies as well as customer, end market and geographic diversity. We have
completed 72 acquisitions since 2007 with a majority being proprietary opportunities acquired at mid-single digit
purchase multiples. We have historically achieved approximately 98% revenue retention within the 12 months postacquisition, further demonstrating our ability to successfully integrate targets onto our platform while continuing to
provide high quality service to customers. We continue to maintain a propriety pipeline of potential targets as we
continue to execute our roll-up strategy.

**Highly Experienced Management Team**

We have a highly experienced and well-respected management team with a proven track record and
meaningful equity ownership. Management was responsible for developing and implementing the expansion strategy
that has led to industry-leading growth for the company. The team has a strong track record of continuously evolving
and growing the business through both organic and M&A strategies, and is experienced in integrating accretive
acquisitions. The team is committed to delivering continued growth, and has significant equity ownership in Allied
Universal. Outside of the executive management group, there is a deep bench of leadership and operational talent
throughout the organization given the selection of the best security specialists in connection with the merger of
AlliedBarton and Universal in 2016.

**Growth Strategy**

**Proven Ability to Win New Clients and Grow with Existing Clients**

Our underlying organic growth has historically been driven by hours growth attributable to (i) developing a
world-class sales and marketing organization, (ii) leveraging our competitive advantages to win new customers,
including premier customers, (iii) expanding customer penetration and leveraging cross-selling opportunities with
clients by delivering customized service offerings specific to customer needs, and (iv) maintaining steady underlying
customer retention rates in the 90% range in the long term, and pricing growth driven by passing on pay rate increases
to customers. In order to drive new customer wins for Allied Universal, our sales organization is structured by
salespeople focused on premier customers, salespeople focused on regional and local accounts, vertical market
specialists, and regional specialists. Our sales pipeline is robust, with the pipeline typically representing a multiple of
the annual new starts target. Premier customers sales efforts target customers with facilities in multiple locations
throughout the United States, who increasingly desire consistency of service, fewer points of contact and alignment
with a national partner providing a full suite of capabilities. As we have expanded our geographical footprint and
adapted sales and client service capabilities, we have become well-positioned to be the leading provider to premier
customers . With our existing customers, we seek to grow customer penetration by increasing the number of customer
sites served and thus the hours that our security officers cover, and adding on different types of security services. Our
organic growth is supported by underlying customer retention rates in the 90% range over the past 10 years. Given
the multi-year contractual nature of many of our large contracts, we have visibility over a significant portion of our


-----

revenue . We proactively manage contracts in advance of renewal, rebid or expiration. Finally, organic growth has
been driven by increasing pricing in line with security officer pay rate increases. We have demonstrated a history of
successfully increasing bill rates with pay rates, as evidenced by stable mark-up rate and increasing mark-up spread
over the long term.

We have grown our revenue at a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2005 and 2020. We believe we are
well-positioned to continue achieving measured growth by capitalizing on our strong reputation, enhanced operational
capabilities, vertical-specific service expertise and premier customers platform. In addition to increasing hours by
adding new accounts, benefiting from increased outsourcing, we will continue to leverage our significant experience
managing pricing dynamics to drive growth.

**Service Line Expansion**

The combination of Allied Universal and G4S is expected to generate meaningful cross-selling opportunities.
The combined comprehensive offering of security solutions across a global platform will allow the combined business
to serve as a one-stop-shop for existing customers served by the combined group, as well as new clients looking for a
global provider to serve their security needs. The expertise of each organization in serving specific end markets and
geographies will increase the overall reach and ability to serve global clients across a range of industries with a host
of complimentary services.

Our industry-leading manned guarding services provide a platform from which to continue offering
additional services. To date, we have utilized this platform to offer additional services, such as physical technology
systems, including video surveillance, CCTV picture capture and monitoring, robot patrolling, GPS based patrol and
reporting, online threat monitoring, and managing access control points and centralized security operation.
Additionally, we also offer integration services to design, install and service fully integrated technology-based
monitoring systems. Finally, we provide digital solutions and remote monitoring through MaRC.

Our acquisition of Securadyne Systems (“Securadyne”) in April 2019 further strengthened our ability to
consult, design, deploy, integrate and maintain electronic security systems for our customers. We believe the
Securadyne acquisition provided us with the footprint and scalable infrastructure that enables us to deliver
complementary security integration services to a significantly larger portion of the existing approximately 50,000
client sites where we provide manned guarding services today.

In addition to system installation, maintenance, robots, and monitoring, we have integrated technology into
our manned guarding services and are in the process of deploying a custom Incident Management System (“IMS”)
that provides real-time incident data reporting and situational awareness information powered by artificial intelligence.
The proprietary application, HeliAUS, provides in-depth incident reporting, data collection, and predictive analytics,
allowing managers and clients to spot trends and react quickly, while improving workforce supervision and improving
liability management. The highly scalable platform is delivered to customers via a monthly subscription and is billed
directly to users as a supplement to manned guarding services.

Beyond our technology offerings, we intend to continue to grow our janitorial and staffing services, which
are a portfolio of offerings including cleaning services and a provider of skilled talent across a diverse set of industries
such as traditional janitorial functions as well as highly specialized cleaning services such as bio- hazard disposal, IT
room cleaning, and recycling programs.

**Proven Platform for Disciplined M&A**

We benefit from our significant experience in successfully integrating acquisitions while maintaining
relationships with both existing and acquired customers. The largely fragmented security services industry has
historically provided opportunities to supplement our strong organic growth with a disciplined acquisition strategy. A
large and fragmented international market, as well as relevant adjacent markets, provides additional opportunity for
targeted expansion. Our approach to acquisitions has been highly methodical and focused on scale-building and infill
acquisitions. Integration occurs quickly, generally within 30 days for a typical tuck-in acquisition, making for a
seamless transition for customers.


-----

Allied Universal has proven experience executing all types of transactions, including 72 small tuck-ins and
large transformational acquisitions since 2007. On average, these acquisitions were completed at credit accretive, midsingle digit multiples. In addition to many small and medium tuck-ins, we have a proven track record of successfully
executing and integrating transformative acquisitions, as evidenced by the combination of AlliedBarton and Universal
in August 2016, as well as the large tuck-in acquisition of USSA, formerly the fourth-largest manned guarding
provider in the United States in 2018. The combination of our smaller tuck-in acquisitions along with our ability to
acquire targets of scale, such as USSA, demonstrate our disciplined ability to take advantage of growth opportunities
as they become available.

We believe we are an “acquirer of choice” due to our strong reputation and track record and are the bestpositioned consolidator in a highly fragmented market. A significant portion of our past acquisitions have been
completed on a proprietary basis. Additionally, we estimate that over 40% of the outsourced manned guarding services
market in the United States is comprised of over 7,000 firms and roughly 60% of the security technology services
market is comprised of over 3,000 firms, providing a large opportunity set for further accretive consolidation. We
benefit from significant industrial logic from on-boarding sub-scale providers onto our scalable platform which drives
the ability to expand margins of acquired companies. We believe the combination of Allied Universal and G4S will
allow us to execute further our disciplined and well-demonstrated M&A playbook in key markets globally.

**Recent Developments**

**The Transactions**

On April 6, 2021, we completed the G4S Acquisition. See “—G4S Acquisition.” In connection with the G4S
Acquisition, on April 8, 2021, we entered into the new senior secured credit facilities (the “New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities”), which consist of (i) a $950.0 million seven year senior secured U.S. dollar term loan facility (the “New
First Lien USD Term Facility”) and a €715.5 million seven year senior secured euro term loan facility (the “New First
Lien Euro Term Facility” and, together with the New First Lien USD Term Facility, the “New First Lien Term Loan
Facilities”) and (ii) a €300.0 million five year senior secured euro revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving Credit
Facility”). In addition, we entered into (i) a new senior secured bridge loan credit facility, pursuant to which secured
bridge loans in the amounts of $900,000,000, $775,000,000, €813,008,135 and £367,647,060 were made available to
us for borrowing (the “Secured Bridge Loan Credit Facility”) and (ii) a new senior unsecured bridge loan credit
facility, pursuant to which unsecured bridge loans in the amount of $1,285,000,000 were made available to us for
borrowing (together with the Secured Bridge Loan Credit Facility, the “Bridge Credit Facilities”). As of the date of
this offering circular, we have incurred secured bridge loans in the amounts of $900,000,000, $775,000,000 and
£367,647,060 and unsecured bridge loans in the amount of $1,285,000,000, and we may borrow up to €813,008,135
under the Secured Bridge Loan Credit Facility.

On April 8, 2021, we also increased the total availability under our five year asset based lending credit facility
from $750.0 million to $1,000.0 million and expect to further increase such facility to $1,500.0 million (such further
increase, the “ABL Credit Facility Increase” and such facility as further amended by the ABL Credit Facility Increase,
the “ABL Credit Facility”). However, there can be no assurance that such increase will be consummated, and this
offering of the notes is not conditioned upon the completion of the ABL Credit Facility Increase.

The amounts borrowed under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Bridge Credit Facilities,
together with cash on hand and certain equity contributions, were used to (i) pay the acquisition consideration in
connection with the G4S Acquisition and (ii) pay related fees, costs, premiums and expenses in connection therewith.
Such net proceeds will also be used for the voluntary or mandatory repayment, redemption, defeasance, tender or
acquisition by Allied Universal in full of certain existing third party indebtedness of G4S (the “Existing G4S Debt”
and such repayment, redemption, defeasance, tender or acquisition, the “G4S Refinancing”). See “Description of
Certain Other Indebtedness” for a description of the Existing G4S Debt. We expect approximately $2,746 million of
the Existing G4S Debt will remain outstanding on the issue date of the notes offered hereby, with all such indebtedness
expected to be repaid within approximately 150 days following the issue date of the notes offered hereby. However,
certain of the Existing G4S Debt may not be capable of voluntary prepayment on its terms, except in connection with
certain adverse changes in taxation and as a result such repayment would be subject to the implementation of a tender
offer in respect of such Existing G4S Debt and/or certain amendments to the instruments governing such Existing
G4S Debt.


-----

The proceeds from this offering of the notes will be used to (i) repay in full borrowings outstanding under
the Bridge Credit Facilities and terminate all available borrowings thereunder and (ii) pay related fees, costs, premiums
and expenses.

In this offering circular, we collectively refer to the entry into the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
G4S Refinancing, the ABL Credit Facility Increase, the entry into and the subsequent repayment of the Bridge Credit
Facilities and the termination of all available borrowings thereunder using the net proceeds of this offering of the
notes, and in each case, the use of proceeds therefrom, as the “Financing Transactions” and the Financing Transactions,
together with the related transactions in connection with the G4S Acquisition, the “Transactions.” See “Use of
Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” for more information.

**Recent and Expected Acquisitions**

On January 16, 2021, we completed a purchase of the outstanding equity interests in SecurAmerica, LLC,
SecurAmerica Corporation and ERMC LLC (collectively, “SecurAmerica”) for a preliminary purchase price subject
to certain post-closing adjustments of approximately $352 million. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, SecurAmerica is a
provider of security, asset protection and janitorial services with offices located throughout the United States. In
connection with the purchase of SecurAmerica, we also deposited $31.5 million into an escrow account to fund the
future purchase of substantially all of the assets of SecurAmerica TN LLC and ERMC TN LLC (collectively,
“SecurAmerica TN”). Also based in Atlanta, Georgia, SecurAmerica TN is a provider of security and janitorial
services. The transaction is expected to close during 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

Subsequent to December 31, 2020 and prior to the date of this offering circular, we completed two other
tuck-in acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $10.8 million.

Guarantees ........................................................ On the issue date, the notes will be fully and unconditionally
guaranteed, jointly and severally, by (i) each of the Allied
issuer’s existing and future wholly-owned U.S. restricted
subsidiaries that guarantee the Existing Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or that
guarantee certain capital markets debt securities of the issuers
or any guarantor and (ii) each Issue Date Foreign Subsidiary
Guarantor (subject to certain exceptions and in accordance with
certain agreed security principles). See “Business—

issuer as well as certain foreign subsidiaries incorporated in
either Luxembourg or England and Wales will guarantee the
notes by the later of (i) 150 days after the issue date and (ii) the
date on which such foreign subsidiaries provide a guarantee
under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities (subject to certain exceptions
and in accordance with certain agreed security principles). The
guarantees are subject to contractual and legal limitations and
may be released under certain circumstances. See “Description
of Secured Notes—Guarantees,” “Description of Unsecured
Notes—Guarantees” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes.”

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Allied
Universal co-issuers and guarantors (exclusive of G4S and its
consolidated subsidiaries) represented approximately 95.6% of
Allied Universal’s total revenues, 85.0% of Allied Universal’s
total assets and 95.6% of Allied Universal’s total liabilities,
after excluding intercompany transactions and balances. In
addition and subject to certain exceptions and certain agreed
security principles, G4S and each of G4S’s material subsidiaries
incorporated in the United States, Luxembourg and England
and Wales will guarantee the notes offered hereby by the later
of (i) 150 days after the issue date and (ii) the date on which


-----

such U.S. or foreign subsidiaries provide a guarantee under our
Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. As of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020, G4S entities organized in the United
States, Luxembourg and England and Wales represented
approximately 49.0% of G4S’s total revenues and 61.0% of
G4S’s total assets.

Ranking:
Secured notes .............................................. The secured notes will be the issuers’ and the related guarantees
will be the guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will:

                      - rank equally in right of payment with all of the issuers’ and
each guarantor’s existing and future senior indebtedness,
including the unsecured notes, the Existing 2026 Secured
Notes, the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes, the Existing
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities;

                      - be effectively senior to all of the issuers’ and each
guarantor’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness,
including the unsecured notes, the Existing 2027
Unsecured Notes and junior lien indebtedness to the extent
of the value of the assets securing the secured notes and
effectively junior to the ABL Credit Facility to the extent
of the value of the ABL Collateral;

                      - be pari passu with all of the issuers’ and each guarantor’s
existing and future obligations secured on a first lien basis
(other than the obligations secured on a first lien basis on
the Excluded Assets and ABL Collateral);

                      - be effectively junior to all of the issuers’ and each
guarantor’s existing and future obligations secured on a
first lien basis on the Excluded Assets or ABL Collateral,
including obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the
extent of the value of such assets;

                      - rank senior in right of payment to all of the issuers’ and
each guarantor’s future subordinated indebtedness and
other obligations that expressly provide for their
subordination to the secured notes and the related
guarantees; and

                      - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future
indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other
liabilities of any subsidiary of the issuers that are not
guarantors of the secured notes.

Unsecured notes .......................................... The unsecured notes will be the Allied issuer’s and the Allied
co-issuer’s and the related guarantees will be the guarantors’
senior unsecured obligations and will:

                      - rank equally in right of payment with all of the issuers’ and
the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness,


-----

including the secured notes, the Existing 2026 Secured
Notes, the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes, the Existing
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities;

                      - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
secured indebtedness of the issuers and the guarantors,
including the secured notes, the Existing 2026 Secured
Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, to the extent of the
value of the assets securing such secured indebtedness;

                      - rank senior in right of payment to all of the issuers’ and
each guarantor’s future subordinated indebtedness and
other obligations that expressly provide for their
subordination to the unsecured notes and the related
guarantees; and

indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other
liabilities of any subsidiary of the issuers that is not a
guarantor of the unsecured notes.

As of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions, the issuers and the guarantors would
have had $11,457.0 million in total indebtedness outstanding,
none of which would have been subordinated and of which
$9,120.0 million would have been senior secured indebtedness
(in each case excluding capital lease obligations), consisting
entirely of borrowings under the Existing Senior Secured Credit
Facilities (after giving effect to the ABL Credit Facility
Increase and excluding approximately $275.0 million of
expected outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Credit
Facility), the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing
2026 Secured Notes and the secured notes. In addition, as of
December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to
the Transactions, the issuers had an additional $300.0 million of
availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility, an additional €300.0 million
of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under
the New Revolving Credit Facility and $1,500.0 million
(subject to a borrowing base) of availability to incur additional
secured indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility (after
giving effect to the ABL Credit Facility Increase and excluding
approximately $275.0 million of expected outstanding letters of
credit).

Security:
Secured Notes ............................................. The secured notes and related guarantees will be secured on a
first lien basis by substantially all assets of the issuers and the
guarantors (subject to certain agreed security principles and
other than any Excluded Assets or ABL Collateral), which
assets will also secure the issuers’ and the guarantors’
obligations under our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
our New First Lien Term Loan Facilities and our New


-----

Revolving Credit Facility ratably on a pari passu basis, subject
to permitted liens. The secured notes and related guarantees will
also be secured on a second-lien basis ratably on a pari passu
basis with our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our
New First Lien Term Loan Facilities and our New Revolving
Credit Facility, subject to permitted liens, by the ABL
Collateral that secures the ABL Credit Facility on a first lien
basis. See “Description of Secured Notes—Security for the
Sterling Secured Notes.”

Unsecured Notes ......................................... The unsecured notes and the related guarantees will not be
secured by any collateral.

Additional Amounts; Redemption for
Taxation Reasons ............................


If payments made by any issuer or any guarantor on the sterling
secured notes, USD secured notes tranche 2 and euro secured
notes are subject to any withholding or deduction of taxes by
certain relevant tax jurisdictions, subject to certain exceptions,
the issuers and guarantors will be required to pay the additional
amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the
holders of the notes after the withholding or deduction is not
less than the amount that they would have received in the
absence of the withholding or deduction. See “Description of
Secured Notes—Additional Amounts.” In the event that certain
changes in the tax law of any relevant jurisdiction would
impose withholding taxes on payments on the notes and any
additional amount is required as a result, the issuers may
redeem the relevant note in whole, but not in part, at any time,
at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if
any, to the date of redemption. See “Description of Secured
Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” and “Description of
Unsecured Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”


Optional redemption ......................................... At any time prior to      , 2024, the issuers, as applicable,
may, at their option, redeem each series of notes, in whole or in
part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal
amount plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption
date.

From and after      , 2024, the issuers, as applicable, may,
at their option, redeem each series of notes, in whole or in part,
at the applicable redemption prices specified under “Description
of Secured Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description of
Unsecured Notes—Optional Redemption,” together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding,
the redemption date.

In addition, at any time prior to      , 2024, the issuers, as
applicable, may, at their option, redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of each series of notes with an
amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity
offerings at the applicable redemption prices specified under
“Description of Secured Notes—Optional Redemption” and
“Description of Unsecured Notes—Optional Redemption,”
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

In addition, on or before       , 2024, the issuers, as
applicable, may redeem up to 10% of each series of the secured
notes during each of the twelve-month periods ending after the
issue date, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. See
“Description of Secured Notes—Optional Redemption” and
“Description of Unsecured Notes—Optional Redemption.”


-----

Change of control offer .................................... Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of changes of control, if
we do not redeem the notes, you will have the right, as holders
of the notes, to require the issuers to purchase some or all of
your notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the purchase
date. See “Description of Secured Notes—Change of Control”
and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Change of Control.”

Certain covenants ............................................. Each series of notes will be issued under an indenture that will
contain covenants that, among other things, limit the issuers’
ability and the ability of their restricted subsidiaries to:

                      - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue
disqualified stock or certain preferred stock;

                      - pay dividends and make other distributions or repurchase
stock;

                      - make certain investments;

                      - create or incur liens;

                      - sell assets;

                      - enter into restrictions affecting the ability of restricted
subsidiaries that are non-guarantors to make distributions,
loans or advances or transfer assets to the issuers or the
guarantors;

                      - enter into certain transactions with the issuers’ affiliates;

                      - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted
subsidiaries; and

                      - merge, consolidate or transfer or sell all or substantially all
of the issuers’ or the guarantors’ assets.

These covenants are subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions. Most of these covenants will not
apply to the issuers and their restricted subsidiaries during any
period in which the applicable notes are rated investment grade
by two of Fitch Ratings, Inc., Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. See “Description of
Secured Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of
Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants.”

Transfer restrictions; no registration rights ...... The notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws.
The notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and resale and

state securities laws. We will not be required to complete a
registered exchange offer or file a shelf registration statement


-----

for resale of the notes. For more details, see “Transfer
Restrictions.”

No prior market ................................................ The notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
market. Although the initial purchasers of the notes have
advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes, they
are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market
making at any time without notice. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the
notes.

Listing .............................................................. Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of the
non-USD notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can
be no assurance that the non-USD notes will be listed on the
Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in
the non-USD notes will be granted or that such listing will be
maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to
the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial
instruments, as amended. We do not intend to apply for listing
of the USD notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of
the USD notes in any automated dealer quotation system.

secured notes (the “Secured Notes Trustee”).

Unsecured notes trustee .................................... Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee for the
unsecured notes (the “Unsecured Notes Trustee” (and together

Facilities and terminate all available borrowings thereunder and
(ii) pay related fees, costs, premiums and expenses. Borrowings
under the Bridge Credit Facilities and the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, together with cash on hand and certain equity

relating to the G4S Acquisition and (ii) pay related fees, costs,
premiums and expenses in connection therewith. See “Use of
Proceeds.”

Denominations ................................................. The USD notes will be issued in minimum denominations of
$200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
The euro secured notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof. The sterling secured notes will be issued in


-----

minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of
£1,000 in excess thereof.

Governing law .................................................. The notes and the indentures under which they will be issued
will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. Each
security document is governed by applicable local laws. For the
avoidance of doubt, the application of articles 470-1 to 470-19
(inclusive) of the Luxembourg law on commercial companies,
dated 10 August 1915, as amended, is expressly excluded.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED AND PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL**

**INFORMATION**

The following tables set forth Allied Universal’s summary historical consolidated and unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information for the periods and dates indicated. The summary historical consolidated
statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and balance sheet data as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019 have been derived from Allied Universal’s audited consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this offering circular.

The summary unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations data for the year ended December 31,
2020 reflect the G4S Acquisition and related financing transactions as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information,” as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2020. The summary
unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet data as of December 31, 2020 reflect the G4S Acquisition and related
financing transactions as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” as if
such transactions had occurred on December 31, 2020. The summary unaudited pro forma combined statements of
operations data were prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of the G4S Acquisition and related financing
transactions as described under “Unaudited Pro forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” as if such
transactions had occurred on January 1, 2020. For each of the periods presented, the pro forma financial information
reflects the combination of historical financial information of Allied Universal and G4S, adjusted to give effect to a
preliminary purchase price allocation as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
information.” Furthermore, additional pro forma adjustments have also been reflected to address differences in
reporting currencies, differences in bases of accounting and differences in the classification and presentation of certain
financial information. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we
believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our actual
combined results of operations or combined financial condition would have been had the G4S Acquisition described
under the section “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” actually occurred on the dates
indicated, nor do they purport to project our consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition for
any other period or as of any other date. All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described
more fully in the notes under the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

The following historical consolidated and unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is
only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes
thereto included elsewhere in this offering circular, as well as the information included under the section entitled
“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

(1) We define Allied Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax (benefit)
expense and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items and certain
cash expenses management considers non-recurring, unusual or otherwise not indicative of our ongoing
operating performance and to reflect the full expected effect of cost reduction and profit-enhancing initiatives,
acquisitions, disposals and related cost and revenue synergies. Specific adjustments for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020 include adjustments for transaction, integration and restructuring costs, sponsor
and director fees, non-cash equity-based compensation, legal settlements and related fees, certain adjustments
related to the implementation of Allied Universal’s accounting standards, loss on disposal of property and
equipment, loss on early extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on disposal of businesses, and miscellaneous
other non-recurring adjustments, as further adjusted to give effect to start-up costs and lease costs, profitimprovement initiatives, unrealized synergies from certain acquired businesses, management’s estimates of
EBITDA from certain acquired businesses generated prior to their acquisition date, management’s estimates
of EBITDA from certain businesses acquired in 2021, profits related to disposed businesses, and other nonrecurring adjustments, which are described in further detail below. Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA
has been determined based on the combined statements of operations of Allied Universal and G4S for the
year ended December 31, 2020 as adjusted as described under ”Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial Information,” and as further adjusted to reflect certain non-recurring adjustments and unrealized
synergies in connection with the Financing Transactions and G4S Acquisition as described in further detail
below. We define Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenue as Allied Universal’s historical revenue, as
adjusted to give effect to businesses acquired during 2020 and 2021 by Allied Universal, plus G4S’s


-----

historical revenue, as adjusted to give effect to revenue from businesses held for sale by G4S, onerous
contracts, revenue from businesses disposed of by G4S during 2020 and 2021 and constant currency
exchange rate adjustments. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider
them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures, you
should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the
adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures should not be
construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

We present these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures because we believe they assist management and
investors when analyzing our performance by providing meaningful information that facilitates the
comparability of underlying business results from period to period. We recognize these measures are not
measurements of financial performance under GAAP and IFRS and there are limitations associated with the
use of non-GAAP and non-IFRS financial measures. Some of these limitations are:

 - other companies may use different methods to calculate similar non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures,
and the measures we present may not be directly comparable with the measures presented by these
other companies as a result;

 - such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

 - such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

 - such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to
service interest payments, on our debts;

 - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash
requirements for such replacements;

 - non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive
compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating
performance for a particular period;

 - such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not
to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

 - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

Allied Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA are adjusted to reflect certain
acquisitions and certain unrealized acquisition synergies anticipated to be achieved in connection therewith.
We present these adjustments as they will be permitted as adjustments to “EBITDA” under the indentures
that will govern the notes offered hereby, although the non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures included herein
may be defined differently than the corresponding terms under such indentures, and to enable investors to
understand the covenants that will apply to us, and not as a projection of future results. We will be required to
make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, and these cash costs are not reflected in Allied Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we will not fully realize such cost
savings within 12 months of the completion of the Financing Transactions and the G4S Acquisition, and may
not do so at all. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment as a projection that we
will achieve these acquisition synergies. Our ability to realize these acquisition synergies is subject to
significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our
anticipated results. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—We may not realize
the expected benefits, revenue or cost synergies related to recently completed or future acquisitions” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the G4S Acquisition—We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits


-----

of the G4S Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter
significant difficulties in integrating the G4S business.”

Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP and non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in
isolation or as substitutes for, or as superior to, the presentation of results determined in accordance with

**Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA[(r)] .....................................** $1,955,925

(a) Represents transaction, integration and restructuring related costs primarily associated with
professional service fees paid to third parties for pre-acquisition due diligence and post-acquisition
integration services, including operational, information technology, financial and other support
services, as well as costs from re-branding of uniforms, vehicles, facilities and other materials,
employee retention and discretionary bonuses as well as severance payments, costs incurred to
consolidate facilities, employee travel costs and other items attributable to the acquisitions. For the
year ended December 31, 2020, this adjustment includes $14.6 million in transaction costs related to
the G4S Acquisition, as well as other costs associated with tuck-in acquisitions completed during 2020
and the first quarter of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the figure reflects $84.7 million
in transaction costs related to the investments by CDPQ in Allied Universal, completed on December
12, 2019, as well as other costs associated with the acquisition of SOS Security and other tuck-in
acquisitions. The pro forma transaction, integration and restructuring costs also include $43.7 million
in costs incurred by G4S during 2020 for bid defense related to offers received from Garda World


-----

Security Corporation and Allied Universal in 2020, $74.5 million in costs incurred by G4S for its
2018-2020 restructuring program and other transaction costs as if the Financing Transaction and G4S
Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020.

(b) Represents $6.8 million and $5.6 million in fees incurred from our sponsors for services rendered for
strategic planning, management control matters, external financing and other services in 2020 and
2019, respectively. Additionally, $1.7 million and $1.4 million in director fees were paid in 2020 and
2019, respectively. The pro forma sponsor and directors’ fees adjustment for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2020 includes $8.5 million in sponsor and director fees as reported by Allied Universal
for 2020 and $3.8 million in director fees incurred by G4S in 2020.

(c) Represents non-cash equity-based compensation expense.

(d) Represents non-recurring charges related to the settlement of class action lawsuits in excess of our
insurance coverage, in addition to third party fees in connection with such litigation matters. This
includes $14.2 million and $10.9 million related to the settlement of class action suits for unpaid
wages, overtime, meal breaks and other items, in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The pro forma figure
includes the 2020 legal settlements and related fees of Allied Universal and $134.8 million of legal
settlements and related fees incurred by G4S during 2020, of which $66.8 million relates to the
Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into with the UK’s Serious Fraud Office, which was
announced on July 10, 2020.

(e) Represents charges related to non-cash write offs of property and equipment. The pro forma figure
includes $3.8 million in loss on disposal of fixed assets related to G4S in addition to the $4.3 million
reported by Allied Universal for 2020.

(f) Represents charges related to the refinancing of the Company’s debt facility in July 2019. In
connection with the refinancing, the Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of
$88.3 million, which includes the write-off of existing deferred financing fees that had a carrying value
of $62.4 million, $17.7 million of un-accreted original issue discount and $8.2 million of fees paid to
noteholders in connection with the notes redemption.

(g) Represents a gain recognized by G4S during 2020 in relation to the sale of the majority of G4S’s
conventional cash businesses to The Brink’s Company in February 2020.

(h) Represents other miscellaneous non-recurring costs. In 2020, other miscellaneous costs includes
COVID-related costs of $8.5 million, discretionary deal incentives of $7.8 million, deferred
compensation and severances of $3.4 million, consulting fees paid to third-parties for non-recurring
projects of $2.3 million and other costs. In 2019, these costs include unusual workers’ compensation
premium adjustments of $7.7 million, deferred compensation and severances of $2.9 million,
consulting fees paid to third-parties for non-recurring projects of $2.8 million, one-time software
development costs of $2.7 million and other costs. The pro forma figure includes Allied Universal
amounts as reported, $11.0 million in one-time costs incurred by G4S as a result of COVID-19, $2.6
million in Guaranteed Minimum Pension benefit equalization charges as required by UK law, and
other non-recurring costs incurred by G4S, which are partially offset by $5.1 million in income from
joint ventures.

(i) Represents management’s estimate of start-up costs incurred to onboard and train security
professionals at the commencement of a new job. Start-up costs include an estimate for employees’
time, recruitment, travel and other related costs. Start-up costs fluctuate based on win rates and new
job characteristics (e.g., location, type of customer, service provider requirements, etc.).

(j) Represents adjustments for the estimated amortization of assets leased under operating leases based on
the new lease standard adopted by Allied Universal during 2021. Pro forma lease costs include
estimated lease costs incurred by G4S to conform to Allied Universal’s accounting policies. Pro forma


-----

depreciation expense for G4S was adjusted by an equal and offsetting amount as G4S had already
adopted IFRS 16, the new lease accounting standard, and had previously recognized lease costs as
depreciation expense.

(k) Represents adjustments to reflect the estimated impact of our profit-improvement initiatives including
both revenue and cost savings initiatives. Based on our current initiatives, we expect to realize cost
savings related to employee medical insurance, telecommunications, background checks incurred in
recruiting process, workers’ compensation and other operating costs which on a combined basis would
have resulted in estimated cost savings of approximately $9.0 million and $17.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, adjustments include the estimated
impact of our margin improvement plan initiatives for which actions have been taken to increase bill
rates, reduce non-billable overtime, increase customer billbacks for costs incurred on customers’
behalves, reduce fleet, travel and other recurring costs, and enhance staffing alignment in an effort to
improve margins, which would have led to increased profitability totaling $42.0 million and $25.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(l) Represents adjustments to reflect the estimated impact of unrealized cost saving synergies related to
acquired businesses. Leveraging our existing infrastructure, we expect to realize cost savings primarily
related to the elimination of redundant overhead personnel, consolidation of facilities, and other
synergies from leveraging our scale, including lower insurance premiums and per employee benefit
costs. Acquired businesses and timing of run-rate effect periods for synergies include Securadyne,
from January 1, 2019 to April 14, 2019, Midstate Security Company, LLC (“Midstate”), from January
1, 2019 to August 25, 2019, SOS Security, from January 1, 2019 to December 30, 2019, Advent
Systems, Inc. (“Advent”), from January 1, 2019 to November 2, 2019, APG Security (“APG”), from
January 1, 2019 to November 24, 2019, Phoenix Systems & Service, Inc. (“PSSI”), from January 1,
2020 to July 16, 2020, Summit Security Services, Inc. (“Summit”), from January 1, 2020 to August
30, 2020, Service Works Inc. (“Service Works”), from January 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020, and Safe
Environment Business Solutions, Inc. (“SEB”), from January 1, 2020 to October 15, 2020.

(m) Represents adjustments to include the impact of EBITDA, adjusted for unusual, out-of-period and

certain other items, from acquired businesses generated prior to their acquisition date. Acquired
businesses, and the related pre-acquisition adjustment period, for the fiscal year ended December 30,
2019 include (i) Securadyne, from January 1, 2019 to April 14, 2019, (ii) Point 2 Point, from January
1, 2019 to May 2, 2019, (iii) Cypress, from January 1, 2019 to June 20, 2019, (iv) Shetler, from
January 1, 2019 to July 11, 2019, (v) Midstate, from January 1, 2019 to August 25, 2019, (vi) Advent,
from January 1, 2019 to November 2, 2019, (vii) Vinson, from January 1, 2019 to November 14, 2019,
(viii) APG, from January 1, 2019 to November 24, 2019, and (ix) SOS Security from January 1, 2019
to December 30, 2019. Pre-acquisition adjusted EBITDA related to the SOS Security Acquisition was
$42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Acquisition adjusted EBITDA related to the
other completed acquisitions were a combined $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Acquired businesses, and the related pre-acquisition adjustment period, for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2020 include (i) PSSI, from January 1, 2020 to July 16, 2020, (ii) Service Works, from
January 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020, (iii) Summit, from January 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020, (iv)
Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (“BWI”) contract assets, from January
1, 2020 to September 30, 2020, (v) SEB, from January 1, 2020 to October 15, 2020, and (vi) Platt
Security, from January 1, 2020 to November 19, 2020. Acquisition adjusted EBITDA related to the
completed acquisitions were a combined $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

(n) Represents adjustments to include the impact of EBITDA, adjusted for the realization of expected
synergies, from acquired businesses in the first quarter of 2021. Acquired businesses includes
SecurAmerica, acquired on January 16, 2021, and two other tuck in acquisitions completed during the
first quarter of 2021. Acquisition adjusted EBITDA related to these completed acquisitions were a
combined $55.9 million on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2020.


-----

(o) Represents pro forma adjustments to remove EBITDA earned by G4S on the conventional cash
business sold to The Brink’s Company in February 2020 and for businesses held for sale during 2020
but for which the sale was not yet final as of December 31, 2020.

(p) Reflects other non-recurring adjustments allowed by the Company’s debt covenants for integration
costs incurred by administrative and shared service personnel and other miscellaneous non-recurring
items, offset by EBITDA for the non-controlling interests in Allied Universal’s janitorial business.

(q) For the year ended December 31, 2020, represents expected synergies related to the G4S Acquisition
developed during our quality of earnings and due diligence process, which represents approximately
$124 million of synergies driven by overlapping functions in North America (including approximately
$11 million for facilities expenses, $22 million for field operations headcount, $20 million for sales
headcount, $28 million for corporate headcount, $28 million for non-headcount and $14 million for
direct labor cost improvements) and approximately $31 million of synergies from global G4S
corporate cost, including general and administrative expenses and expenses in functional support areas
that support G4S’s status as a public listed company. The synergies represent approximately one-third
of addressable cost structure. We expect that approximately 60% of these synergies will be realized
within the next 12 months, including all global G4S corporate costs, with the remainder expected to be
realized by the end of 2022. To achieve these synergies, we expect to incur one-time costs of
approximately $250 million. Our ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the G4S
Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control,
see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the G4S Acquisition—We may fail to realize all of the anticipated
benefits of the G4S Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may
also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the G4S business.”

(r) The average exchange rate used for translation of the reconciliation for the G4S portion of the pro

forma combined amounts is 1.36 GBP to USD, which reflects the exchange rate related to hedges that
were entered into prior of the submission of the Allied Universal’s offer for G4S and results in G4S
Adjusted EBITDA of $862.6 million. Utilizing the average exchange rate during 2020 of 1.284 GBP to
USD would result in G4S Adjusted EBITDA of $814.4 million.

(2) The Company defines pro forma net secured debt as secured debt outstanding (after giving effect to the ABL
Credit Facility Increase and excluding approximately $275.0 million of expected outstanding letters of credit
under the ABL Credit Facility and approximately $92.0 million of capital leases, in each case as of December
31, 2020) less cash on a pro forma basis for the notes issued hereby. The Company defines pro forma net total
debt as total debt outstanding (after giving effect to the ABL Credit Facility Increase and excluding
approximately $275.0 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility as
of December 31, 2020) less cash on a pro forma basis for the notes issued hereby. Cash on a pro forma basis
represents $1,704 million of Pro Forma Combined Cash as determined under “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information” plus approximately $71 million for short term
investments/marketable securities of G4S, less approximately $497 million of overdrafts and liabilities to
customers for G4S as of December 31, 2020, $372 million of cash associated with tuck-in acquisitions
completed during the first quarter of 2021 and $93 million of other transaction costs, net of the impact of
foreign currency adjustments.

We present G4S Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of G4S’s performance that is not required by
or presented in accordance with IFRS. We define G4S Adjusted EBITDA as profit / (loss) before interest expense,
net, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash
items and certain cash expenses management considers non-recurring, unusual or otherwise not indicative of our
ongoing operating performance and to reflect the full expected effect of cost reduction and profit-enhancing
initiatives, acquisitions, disposals and related cost and revenue synergies. Specific adjustments for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020 include adjustments for transaction and integration costs, director fees, non-cash
equity-based compensation, legal settlements and related fees, loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment,
loss (gain) on contingent consideration, certain IFRS adjustments, start-up costs, lease costs, management’s
estimates of EBITDA related to disposed businesses, constant currency exchange rate adjustments and other nonrecurring adjustments described below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we
consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating these non-IFRS measures, you should be aware
that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this
presentation. Our presentation of these non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that our future
results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

We present G4S Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it assists management and investors when analyzing
our performance by providing meaningful information that facilitates the comparability of underlying business
results from period to period. We recognize G4S Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance
under IFRS and there are limitations associated with the use of non-IFRS financial measures. Some of these
limitations are:

    - other companies may use different methods to calculate similar non-IFRS measures, and the measures
we present may not be directly comparable with the measures presented by these other companies as a
result;

    - such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

    - such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to
service interest payments, on our debts;

    - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash
requirements for such replacements;


-----

  - non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive
compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating
performance for a particular period;

  - such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not
to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

  - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as
substitutes for, or as superior to, the presentation of results determined in accordance with IFRS.

G4S Adjusted EBITDA in USD[(m)] ............................................ $ 863 $ 860

(a) Reflects costs of £34 million incurred by G4S during 2020 for bid defense related to offers received
from Garda World Security Corporation and Allied Universal in 2020 and restructuring and separation
charges of £58 million incurred by G4S for the year ended December 31, 2020, which include
restructuring costs of £37 million incurred by G4S for its 2018-2020 restructuring program among
other costs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this adjustment reflects restructuring and
separation charges of £57 million, which include restructuring costs of £19 million incurred by G4S
for its 2018-2020 restructuring program.

(b) Represent director fees incurred by G4S in the period indicated.

(c) Represents share-based payments.

(d) Represents non-recurring charges related to the settlement of class action lawsuits in excess of
insurance coverage, in addition to third party fees in connection with such litigation matters. For the


-----

year ended December 31, 2020 includes £105 million of legal settlements and related fees incurred by
G4S, of which £52 million relates to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into with the UK’s
Serious Fraud Office which was announced on July 10, 2020.

(e) Represents a pro forma gain recognized by G4S during 2020 in relation to the sale of the majority of
G4S’s conventional cash businesses to The Brink’s Company in February 2020.

(f) Represents charges related to non-cash write offs of property and equipment.

(g) Represents an estimate of IFRS to GAAP accounting policy adjustments, which are primarily related
to the reversal of impairment charges that would not have been recorded under US GAAP and uniform
costs. Uniform costs are included in G4S cost of sales and are added back to arrive at Adjusted
EBITDA.

(h) Represents other miscellaneous non-recurring costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other
miscellaneous costs includes £8.6 million in one-time costs incurred by G4S as a result of COVID-19,
£2 million in Guaranteed Minimum Pension benefit equalization charges as required by UK law, and
other non-recurring costs, which are partially offset by £4 million in share of profit after tax from joint
ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2019, other miscellaneous consists primarily of £5 million
of share of profit after tax from joint ventures and other miscellaneous income partially offset by other
miscellaneous costs.

(i) Represents management’s estimate of start-up costs incurred to onboard and train security
professionals at the commencement of a new job. Start-up costs include an estimate for employees’
time, recruitment, travel and other related costs. Start-up costs fluctuate based on win rates and new
job characteristics (e.g., location, type of customer, service provider requirements, etc.).

(j) Represents adjustments for the estimated amortization of assets leased under operating leases on a pro
forma basis as if G4S had adopted the new U.S. GAAP lease standard. Adjustment is a reclassification
from depreciation expense and has no impact on G4S Adjusted EBITDA.

(k) Represents pro forma adjustments to remove profits earned by G4S on the conventional cash business
sold to The Brink’s Company in February 2020 and for businesses held for sale during 2020 but which
the sale was not yet final.

(l) Represents adjustment to restate the financial data for the year ended December 31, 2019 using the
average currency exchange rate applicable to the year ended December 31, 2020.

(m) The average exchange rate used for translation of the reconciliation for the G4S Adjusted EBITDA is

1.36 GBP to USD, which reflects the exchange rate related to hedges that were entered into prior of the
submission of Allied Universal’s Offer for G4S and results in G4S Adjusted EBITDA of $862.6
million for 2020 and $859.5 million for 2019. Utilizing the average exchange rate during 2020 of
1.284 GBP to USD would result in G4S Adjusted EBITDA of $814.4 million for 2020 and $811.6
million for 2019.

_discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this_
_offering circular._

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industries**

**The COVID-19 pandemic, its scope and duration and the uncertainty related thereto may adversely affect**
**our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.**

The Company continues to closely monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess any
potential impact on its business. While the Company currently does not anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will
have a material adverse impact on its business, as a result of the evolving and highly uncertain nature of the COVID19 pandemic, no assurance may be made regarding potential exposure or the indirect effects of the outbreak on the
Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.

The COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the potential adverse effects of the other risks on our business,
including, but not limited to, the likelihood of and impact from:

  - overall economic conditions, globally and in the United States, which have been and will likely continue to
be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns;

  - our ability to maintain sufficient key personnel due to employee illness, quarantine requirements, worker
absences, enhancements to unemployment compensation benefits and other government relief programs,
social-distancing, travel or other restrictions;

  - reduced availability and productivity of labor;

  - continued or expanded closures of our customers’ facilities;

  - our customers’ demand and ability to pay for our services, or attempts by our customers to defer payments
owed to us;

  - our ability to obtain new customers, expand, or otherwise execute strategic plans;

  - our ability to comply with new legal or regulatory requirements enacted in connection with the COVID-19
pandemic;

  - legal actions, claims or proceedings related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and

  - the ability of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers and business partners, to timely meet
their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so.

**The industries in which we operate are intensely competitive and price-sensitive. If we cannot successfully**
**compete with new or existing providers of products and services similar to ours or enhance our existing**
**products and services, our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.**

The industries in which we operate are intensely competitive. We directly compete with companies that are
national and international in scope. Our competitors may expand their current product and service offerings more
rapidly, including by bundling the products and services they offer, adapting to new or emerging technologies more
quickly, taking advantage of acquisitions or devoting greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and
services than we do. We also compete with smaller local and regional companies that may have better knowledge of
the local conditions in their regions, are better known locally and are better able to gain customers in their regions.
There are relatively low barriers to entry in the industries in which we operate, and we have faced and expect to
continue to face additional competition from new entrants. In addition, it has become more common for our customers
to select service providers through competitive bid processes intended to procure quality services at lower prices.
Some of our competitors may be willing to provide services at lower prices, accept a lower profit margin or expend
more capital in order to obtain or retain business. We may not be able to retain customer accounts at historic levels in
an increasingly competitive market or acquire new customer accounts and retain existing customer accounts on terms
as favorable as those previously available, and if we are unable to do so our business, financial condition and results
of operations will be adversely affected. Rapid technological advances, changing delivery models and evolving
standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and
increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the
industries in which we compete. As digital advancement develops, we may also face increased competition from
technology companies.

If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated, high quality products and services, respond to
trends in the market, enhance and improve our product and service offerings in a timely manner or at all or position
and price our products and services to meet demand, we may have difficulty retaining existing customers or growing
our customer base.

**As a contractor with national and local governments, public sector bodies and agencies and government**
**regulated customers, we are subject to procurement rules and regulations, procurement delays and service**
**criteria.**

As a contractor with governments, public sector bodies and agencies, and government-regulated customers,
we must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements, which can change from time to time.
We may also be subject to additional data protection and confidentiality requirements in relation to government
contracts.

These requirements, although customary when entering into contracts with public sector bodies, increase our
bidding, performance and compliance costs. There is also a risk that procurement requirements or “eligibility to bid”
criteria may change, which could affect our eligibility to bid for such contracts and increase the costs of bidding for,
or complying with, such contracts. Failure to comply with or satisfy bid criteria, procurement rules and regulations,
to meet service levels and performance obligations, or to meet data protection and confidentiality requirements, could
result in reductions in the number or value of contracts to be awarded to us and in not being allowed to participate in
future tenders with government, public sector and government regulated customers, or contract modifications or
terminations. In addition, inaccurate billing or pricing may lead to fraud claims from governments.

Our inability to contract with public sector bodies at all or for a period of time could negatively impact our
reputation and ability to procure public sector work in the future.

Public sector projects may also require relevant governmental or other approvals. Difficulties in obtaining
such approvals may lead to projects being delayed before procurement has started, during the tender stage or during
the period between being appointed as the preferred bidder and execution of final contracts. Delays in awarding public
contracts may also arise from challenges to the award of the contracts by competitors. These matters are beyond our
control and any resulting delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.


-----

**Our business is susceptible to economic downturns.**

While we have a diversified customer base across multiple geographies, as well as a network of blue chip
accounts, many customers are located in urban centers and major metropolitan areas. As a result, periods of economic
downturn can increase our attrition rate among existing customers. In the small business segment, customers were
particularly impacted by the economic downturn and sought to reduce their costs or were forced to close their
businesses. Small business subscriptions are more directly correlated to economic conditions. A recession or period
of economic uncertainty could lead to increases in our attrition rate and could reduce the inflow of new customers
purchasing our services and products. In addition, a recession or economic downturn could result in increased defaults
or bankruptcies by our customers, reducing the likelihood of collecting accounts receivable from such customers.
Periods of economic downturn can also negatively impact our ability to sell new products and services.

A decline in outsourcing by clients, a reversal of the trend towards globalization in large corporations, any
deterioration of the current economic situation in the market segments in which we operate, or in the global
economy as a whole, and major changes in market dynamics, including new technologies, government legislation or
customer consolidation could have a negative impact on our revenues and increase our financing costs,
circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and our results of
operations.

**Our standard customer contracts for security officer services are short-term, and if we are unable to retain**
**our existing security officer service contracts or obtain new security service contracts, our results of**
**operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.**

Our standard customer contracts for security officer services are short-term, and if we are unable to retain
our existing security officer service contracts or obtain new security service contracts, our results of operations and
financial condition will be adversely affected. Our standard customer contract has a one-year term but may be
terminated by either our customer or us with 30 days’ advance notice. Many of our larger contracts are multi-year but
also allow for cancellation by either party with 30 to 90 days’ advance notice. We serve certain of our customers under
month-to-month extensions of these written contracts. If we are not able to maintain our existing security service
contracts or obtain additional security service contracts, our business, financial condition and results of operations will
be adversely affected.

**The nature of our business exposes us to significant risks related to legal proceedings, claims, governmental**
**inquiries and investigations, and negative press and media investigations that could have a material adverse**
**effect on our reputation, business, and results of operations.**

The nature of our business exposes us to significant risks related to legal proceedings, claims, governmental
inquiries and investigations, and negative press and media investigations. In particular, the services we provide, the
customers and facilities we serve, our employees, and our interactions with members of the public result in our facing
significant inherent business, economic and reputational risks. The success of our business depends to a large extent
on our reputation and our ability to maintain good relationships with our customers.

In recent years, both Allied and G4S have been involved in numerous incidents that have resulted in lost
business, reductions in revenue, legal and regulatory proceedings, governmental inquiries and investigations, fines
and penalties, negative publicity and constraints on both companies’ ability to raise capital. Given the nature of our
ongoing business, there can be no assurances that similar or more significant events will not happen in the future. The
following are among such incidents in recent years:

In 2019, Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund banned all financial holdings in G4S on the basis that the group
contributes to or is responsible for serious or systematic human rights violations, noting that G4S takes custody of
employment passports in certain geographies and certain employees had to take large loans to pay employment referral
fees.

In 2019, G4S lost its contract to run Birmingham Prison as a result of operational failures. Among others,
the British government alleged that the Birmingham facility had the highest assault rate of any prison in England and


-----

Wales. In 2017, BBC’s Panorama program obtained undercover footage of detainees allegedly being abused at Brook
House, an immigration center operated by G4S. As a result of G4S’ investigation and the BBC program, 14 of the 21
staff members allegedly involved either resigned or had their employment terminated. There have been (and continue
to be) various public inquiries and investigations into these events. G4S did not seek to renew its contracts to run
Gatwick’s immigration removal centers, including Brook House, which expired in May 2020. Further, in 2016, BBC’s
Panorama program accused G4S staff of allegedly using unnecessary force and inappropriate language with teenage
boys at the Medway Secure Training Centre, Rochester. Sixteen people were later arrested, however there were no
convictions. G4S held the contract to run the Medway Secure Training Centre, Rochester, from 1998 to 2016, at which
point G4S’s contract was not renewed.

Claims have been brought on behalf of American service members alleging that G4S, as well as a number of
other multinational companies operating in Afghanistan, including U.S. companies, provided support to the Taliban
in Afghanistan. The claims have been brought under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act on behalf of American service
members and civilians who were killed or injured in Afghanistan. There are approximately 900 plaintiffs as of April
2021. G4S’s motion to dismiss is currently pending and potential monetary damages, if any, are not yet known.

G4S’s executives, managers and guards are alleged to have failed to secure weapons owned by G4S despite
warnings that its missing weapons have been used in crimes. We believe that more than 600 G4S weapons have been
reported lost or stolen since 2009.

In 2016, a G4S employee who had passed G4S background checks despite being placed on a terror watch list
committed a nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people and injured another 53. Although the
employee was off-duty and used his own weapon, the incident resulted in negative publicity. Florida’s Fourth District
Court of Appeal upheld a 2018 trial court’s dismissal of a negligence lawsuit against G4S brought by survivors of
relatives of the deceased.

In 2013, the UK Serious Fraud Office (“SFO”) commenced a criminal investigation of G4S Care and Justice
Services Limited (“G4S C&J”) based on allegations that it had been overcharging and providing fraudulent invoices
and financial reporting to the Ministry of Justice for services related to electronic monitoring. In 2014, G4S C&J
reported to the SFO that it had failed to provide accurate financial reports to the Ministry of Justice and later settled
with the Ministry of Justice. The SFO then charged G4S C&J with three past offenses of fraud. In July 2020, G4S
C&J entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the SFO, which is set to conclude in July 2023 and G4S plc
made a binding undertaking to ensure compliance. In 2019, shareholders brought a class action claim seeking damages
for alleged losses following G4S’s share price decline in 2013 as a result of omitting information about wrongful
billing practices with respect to G4S’s contract with the UK government. Although G4S won a motion to strike 90%
of the claimants from the case on procedural grounds, the judge is allowing these institutional investors to challenge
his decision to bar most of them from suing G4S.

The Belgian Competition Authority (BCA) and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice (DOJ) are conducting investigations into G4S’s Belgian business and allegations of price fixing with respect
to government contracts. These investigations are ongoing.

G4S is subject to a number of claims in India, mainly related to periods prior to 2011, regarding payments to
the India Provident Fund (India’s retirement plan that is regulated on a state-by-state basis). The issue is whether G4S
was correct to make payments based on basic wages, excluding other parts of the salary (such as bonuses), prior to
2011.

In 2013, video footage from the Mangaung Correctional Centre showed alleged mistreatment of South
African prisoners by G4S employees providing services there. G4S denied the allegations. In December 2013, South
African government officials took over the maximum-security facility after G4S allegedly failed to effectively control
the facility. Within ten months, G4S regained responsibility for servicing the prison from the government. In 2015, a
group of South African prisoners sued G4S with respect to alleged mistreatment.

G4S took over a contract with Israeli prisons in the West Bank after buying a competitor in 2002.
International investors divested stakes in G4S amid accusations by international NGOs that G4S was complicit in war
crimes. In 2015, G4S allowed certain Israeli contracts to expire.


-----

Between October 2012 and March 2014, G4S Australia Pty. Ltd. operated the Manus Island Regional Centre
in Papua, New Guinea, which was used to hold immigrants awaiting deportation. There were press reports of alleged
human rights issues at such facility and a complaint by an international development organization, litigation brought
by former employees and a class action brought by detainees relating to conditions at such facility. In March 2014,
G4S Australia’s contract expired and it ceased its operation of the center and subsequently claims related to this matter
were settled.

Allied and G4S have taken significant steps to mitigate the consequences of all the above incidents. However,
as set out above and in “Business—Legal Proceedings,” a number of these incidents are still subject to ongoing review,
investigation and litigation. We can also make no assurances that similar, or more significant, incidents will not happen
in the future.

Such events in the past or future could result in negative publicity relating to the quality of our services or
our brand, including as a result of a security incident or breach at one or more of our customers’ locations or shortfalls
in our customer service. Such events could also result in damage to our reputation and the loss of existing or new
customers legal proceedings, claims and governmental inquiries and investigations. Such incidents can accordingly
have a negative effect on our revenues, exposure to significant litigation and regulatory risk, and result in overall
reputational harm, all of which individually or in the aggregate can have and, in the past, had significant consequences
for our business that could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

**We are subject to increasing operating costs, including labor costs, and inflation risk which may adversely**
**affect our earnings.**

We are subject to increasing operating costs. We are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries,
wages, benefits and other administrative costs. Price increases are also associated with expenses, in particular, labor
costs. As a result, our operating costs may increase faster than our associated revenues, resulting in a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Minimum wage legislation, complex labor legislation, shortages of qualified workers, termination benefits,
payroll, payroll taxes and employee related benefits may also affect our ability to control labor costs. Specifically, we
believe that we have higher wages and related payroll taxes and benefits costs than other participants in our industry
due to our focus on attracting and retaining a highly qualified workforce. Furthermore, our payroll tax expenses
historically are higher in the first half of the year because a significant number of employees do not reach their taxable
wage limits for employer related federal and state unemployment taxes until the second half of the year. In the event
that we experience a significant or material increase in labor costs and are not able to pass some or all of those costs
on to our customers due to fixed hourly bill rates or fixed fee contracts, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Such fixed price contracts are primarily related to some of our
government contracts.

Because our business is labor intensive, we rely on being able to attract and retain high quality employees
within all of the geographic regions and service areas in which we operate. On a combined basis after giving effect to
the Transactions, we employ approximately 740,000 security professionals. Labor is a key component of the daily
operation and continued growth of our business. While we believe that we have lower employee turnover than many
of our competitors, turnover of contract security officers and administrative staff is significant in our industry,
including at our Company. Any difficulties in attracting, training and retaining qualified personnel, including
successors for departing personnel, may have an adverse impact on our results.

A significant portion of our employees work under collective bargaining agreements. These existing
collective bargaining agreements may not be able to be extended or renewed on their current terms, and we may be
unable to negotiate collective bargaining agreements in a favorable and timely manner. We may also become subject
to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future or our non-unionized workers may unionize, any of which
may could have a material adverse effect on our costs, operations and business.


-----

**Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain the members of our management team, key**
**employees and other qualified personnel.**

Our success is dependent upon the continuing efforts, abilities and business generation capabilities of our
management team and other key employees. We have programs in place to motivate, reward and retain our
management teams and such key employees, including cash bonus and equity incentive plans. However, the loss or
departure of members of our management team or other key employee could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations, and we may not be able to attract and retain individuals with
the same or similar levels of experience or expertise. Additionally, screening and vetting of qualified personnel is a
challenge in some territories, which lack supporting infrastructure from the relevant authorities. Factors, such as
minimum levels of training and/or licenses for employees in certain positions in various countries and increasing
levels of regulation, may limit our ability to recruit new employees and replace leaving employees effectively, thereby
limiting our ability to expand our business. Any incident where our people fail to meet the expectations of our
customers and other stakeholders, including the effective sourcing, supervising, training and screening of staff, or nonadherence by employees and contractors to our culture and values as designed and expected, could lead to significant
reputational harm and material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Competition for qualified senior managers and other key employees in our industry is intense, and there is limited
availability of persons with the relevant experience. We could experience a delay or higher costs in order to attract,
train and retain qualified senior managers and such key employees from time to time.

**Our business operates in a regulated industry, and noncompliance with regulations could materially restrict**
**our operations and expose us to fines, penalties and other liabilities and negative consequences.**

Our operations and employees are subject to various laws and regulations, including a large number of city,
county, state and federal occupational licensing laws and regulations that apply to security officers. Relevant
regulation for our operations and employees includes such matters as consumer protection, wage and hour rules (or
“labor laws”), fair trade, jurisdiction-specific security industry regulation (including with respect to hardware
requirements or operational requirements), data privacy, marketing and competition law. Additionally, most states in
the United States have laws, or legislation pending, requiring qualification, training and registration of security
officers, regulating the use of identification cards, badges and uniforms and imposing minimum bond surety or
insurance standards. In order to install a security system, we generally must be licensed in the jurisdiction where we
are installing the system. Additionally, we generally must obtain operating certificates or permits for our security
systems, and provide specified levels of training to our employees at those centers. We are also governed by
regulations relating to when we can forward alarms to emergency providers, and are subject to certain consequences
if we forward false alarms to such emergency providers.

Any failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations (local or otherwise) in which we operate may result
in fines, penalties or a suspension or termination of our right to provide our security services in the relevant
jurisdiction. Additionally, changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could cause us to
incur significant costs and expenses to comply with such laws or regulations, or become unable to operate in the
security market segment within the localities in which such laws or regulations are implemented, or could impact our
sales channels. Such changes may also result in delays in commencement or completion of services for our customers
or the need to modify completed installations. Any limitation on our ability to operate our business due to legal or
regulatory reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we are subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to economic and trade sanctions
and bribery and corruption, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our failure to comply
with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations may expose us to reputational harm as well as
significant penalties, including criminal fines, imprisonment, civil fines, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and
debarment from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. We have adopted an anti-corruption policy
and we train selected employees on anti-bribery compliance. However, our current policies and procedures may not
address the full scope of all possible corruption-related risks, or employees or other persons acting on our behalf might
act in a manner contrary to our anti-corruption policies and procedures, potentially creating liability for us under one
or more anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act. Any such violation, even
if prohibited by our policies and procedures, could have material adverse effects on our financial condition or
reputation.


-----

**We could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery laws of various**
**jurisdictions, export controls, and economic and trade sanctions, and any investigation, and the outcome of any**
**investigation, by government agencies of possible violations by us, our employees, and our business partners of**
**these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.**

We operate a global business, including in parts of the world that have experienced elevated rates of
governmental corruption and have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies
or state-owned or affiliated entities, including state-owned entity customers and government contractors and as
participants in a highly regulated industry. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other applicable
anti-bribery laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from corruptly providing, offering, promising, or
authorizing, directly or indirectly, anything of value to government officials, political parties, or political candidates
for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. Our business must
be conducted in compliance with applicable export controls and economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations,
such as those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
(“OFAC”), the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council
and other relevant governmental authorities.

The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury, the SEC, and other federal agencies and
authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and
individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the FCPA, and other federal statutes and
regulations, including those established by the OFAC. In addition, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, or the Bribery Act,
prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. An
organization that fails to prevent bribery by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the Bribery
Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery.
Under these laws and regulations, as well as other applicable anti-corruption laws, anti-money laundering laws, export
control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies
may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business
activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs,
which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties and
other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results, prospects,
and financial condition.

We have implemented internal controls, policies, procedures, and training designed to ensure compliance by
us and our directors, managers, officers, employees, representatives, consultants and agents with the FCPA, economic
and trade sanctions, the Bribery Act and other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money-laundering and antiterrorism laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that our internal controls, policies, and procedures will protect
us from improper conduct committed by our employees or agents, nor can we assure you that our business partners
have not engaged and will not engage in conduct that could materially affect their ability to perform their contractual
obligations to us or even result in our being held liable for such conduct. Violations of these laws, or allegations of
such violations, could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export
privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S.
government contracts, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating
results, prospects and financial condition. In addition, responding to any enforcement action or internal investigation
related to alleged misconduct may result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and
significant defense costs and other professional fees.

**Changes in available security technology may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial**
**condition.**

Changes in technologies that provide alternatives to security officer services or that decrease the number of
security officers required to perform effectively their services may decrease our customers’ demand for our security
officer services. In addition, if such technologies become available for use in the industry, these technologies may be
proprietary in nature and not be available for use by us in servicing our customers. Even if these technologies are
available for our use, we may not be able to integrate successfully such technologies into our business model or may
be less successful in doing so than our competitors or new entrants in the industry. A decrease in demand for our


-----

security officer services or our inability to effectively utilize such technologies may adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**The security services we provide may subject us to liability for substantial damages not covered by insurance.**

We provide security services at various customer locations both in the United States and internationally.
Under the laws of many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be held liable for the negligent acts or
misconduct of our agents or employees performed while on duty and in the course and scope of their employment. In
many cases, our security service contracts also require us to indemnify our clients or may otherwise subject us to
additional liability for events occurring on client premises. In addition, the laws of many states in the United States
make us responsible for the conduct of our agents and employees. We carry insurance of various types, including
claims, general liability, personal injury, death and property damage, and professional liability insurance, in amounts
management considers adequate for our industry. The majority of companies in which we have management control
are covered by our general liability insurance program, which provides coverage in respect of legal liability for
personal injury and loss or damage to third party property, and Cash in Transit insurance program, which provides
coverage in respect of cash, securities, bullion and precious stones or jewelry. We also maintain self-insured retentions
using captive insurance subsidiaries in order to take advantage of the pooling of risk to obtain optimum coverage and
terms as a group, while ensuring that each individual company’s potential liability is proportionate to the reward
afforded by its contracts. Some of our insurance policies, and the laws of some of the jurisdictions in which we operate,
may limit or prohibit insurance coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages, or liability arising from willful
or grossly negligent conduct.

In the United States, the SAFETY Act (The Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act
of 2002) designation has been renewed for G4S Secure Solutions Inc. from July 22, 2016. We and our customers are
protected against certain claims for damages being awarded as a result of declared acts of terrorism. No assurance can
be given in relation to the scope and extent of such protection.

We also hold claims reserves with wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey and the United
States which underwrite part of our cash solutions, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability policies.
The exposure of each captive is capped on an annual aggregate basis per risk and reinsured back to insurers.

As such, our insurance policies may be inadequate to protect us against liability from the hazards and risks,
including potential claims or damages, related to our business. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain adequate
insurance coverage in the future at rates we consider reasonable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by
insurance, or an event that we did not carry adequate insurance for, could result in substantial losses and could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the ordinary course of business, we experience a significant volume of claims and litigation asserting that
we are liable for damages as a result of the conduct of our employees or others. For example, G4S is facing a claim
under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act on behalf of American service members and civilians who were killed or injured
in Afghanistan, alleging that G4S provided support to the Taliban in Afghanistan. We may from time to time be subject
to claims that our officers have harmed individuals in the course of providing these services, or members of the public
may be otherwise injured by events occurring on client premises, including events that are not under the immediate
control of our security officers, such as terrorist attacks. Many of our employees carry weapons, which involves risk
of damage to people and property. Even though we train our employees to use weapons safely, there is a risk that they
will not follow proper procedures (either negligently or intentionally), or that safety procedures turn out to be
inadequate in particular instances. If so, we may face civil and potentially criminal liability. Liabilities as a result of
such claims or events, including terrorist attacks, may not be covered by insurance.

Furthermore, from time to time individuals bring personal injury lawsuits against us, in some cases seeking
substantial damages based on alleged negligence or other theories of liability relating to our provision of security
services, including with respect to injuries not directly caused by, or within the control of, our security officers or our
response centers. Under principles of common law, we generally can be held liable for wrongful acts or omissions to
act of our agents or employees during the course, and within the scope, of their agency or employment with us. We
are also subject to a significant number of wage and hour class actions and multi-plaintiff lawsuits, single-employee


-----

lawsuits, Private Attorneys General Act claims and attorney demands, in addition to wage and hour governmental
audits, and our liabilities as a result of such actions may be substantial.

**Our growth strategy includes the evaluation of selective acquisition opportunities, which may place**
**significant demands on our resources. We may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition**
**opportunities, obtaining acceptable financing for such acquisition opportunities, reaching agreeable terms**
**with acquisition candidates or successfully integrating acquired businesses.**

An element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of businesses that are complementary in
order to increase our density within certain geographic areas, capture market share in the markets in which we operate
and improve profitability or expand our service offerings. Accordingly, we are presently engaged in, and at any time
in the future we may be engaged in, evaluating potential acquisitions. We regularly make, and expect to continue to
make, non-binding acquisition proposals, and we may enter into letters of intent, in each case allowing us to conduct
due diligence on a confidential basis. As of the date of this offering circular, we have nine letters of intent pending,
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $509 million. The letters of intent are subject to customary
conditions, including due diligence investigations, that may not be satisfied, and any such acquisition is subject to
entry into definitive documentation with respect thereto. We cannot predict the timing of any contemplated acquisition
and any such transaction may be entered into shortly after closing of the offering of the notes.

We will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities, obtain
financing on acceptable terms, obtain approval from regulatory authorities for such acquisitions or reach mutually
agreeable terms with acquisition candidates. In addition, to the extent that consolidation becomes more prevalent in
our industry, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels, thereby limiting our
ability to grow.

Our growth through selective acquisitions may place significant demands on our management and our
operational and financial resources. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the diversion of our management’s
attention from other business concerns, the possibility that current operating and financial systems and controls may
be inadequate to deal with our growth, capital expenditures and accounting charges related to the acquisition and
integration and the potential loss of key employees.

We may encounter difficulties in integrating any businesses we acquire with our existing operations. The
success of these transactions depends on our ability to:

    - successfully merge corporate cultures and operational, financial, information technology and internal
control systems;

    - integrate and retain the customer base of the acquired business;

    - realize cost reduction and revenue synergies;

    - integrate accounting, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective
management, and the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies; and

    - as necessary, retain key management members and technical personnel of acquired companies.

To the extent that we engage in acquisitions in various countries around the world, we face additional risks,
including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the
particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with those jurisdictions.

If we fail to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to manage our growth, that failure could have a
material adverse effect on our business. Further, we may be unable to maintain or enhance the profitability of any
acquired business, consolidate our operations to achieve cost savings or maintain or renew any of our contracts.

In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due
diligence investigations on any company that we may acquire, or have recently acquired. Also, there may be additional


-----

costs relating to acquisitions including, but not limited to, possible purchase price adjustments. Any of our rights to
indemnification from sellers to us, even if obtained, may not be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope
or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities,
individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

**We may not realize the expected benefits, revenue or cost synergies related to recently completed or future**
**acquisitions.**

We have recently completed multiple acquisitions, including acquisitions of SOS Security in December 2019,
PSSI in July 2020, Service Works in August 2020, Summit in August 2020, SEB in October 2020, Platt Security
Incorporated in November 2020, SecurAmerica in January 2021, Eagle Systems in January 2021, Systems Integration,
Inc. in March 2021, and G4S in April 2021. In addition, we plan to continue with our acquisition strategy in the future.
We may not achieve the benefits, revenue and cost synergies related to these acquisitions within the anticipated
timeline or at all. These benefits, revenue and cost synergies are inherently uncertain, and are subject to significant
business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and are
beyond our control.

Our acquisition of Securadyne results in risks related to the growth and integration of our technology service
platform, which was rebranded as Allied Universal Technology Services following such acquisition. In addition, our
ongoing integration of SecurAmerica’s operations, management, personnel and technology may result in interruptions
in our business activities, a deterioration in our employee and client relationships, increased costs and harm to our
reputation with consumers. We are also in the process of integrating G4S Security into our enterprise resource planning
(ERP) systems and implementing new business controls and processes.

**Our growth strategy may fail and lead to a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,**
**financial condition and prospects.**

Our strategic priorities include investing in our people and values, growth and innovation, customers and
service excellence, productivity and operational excellence and financial and commercial discipline, with the aim of
delivering sustainable, profitable growth. Our strategy includes the delivery of cost savings through systems
transformation and our business portfolio program (including the disposal of certain businesses). There can be no
guarantee that our strategy will not be altered or will achieve the desired outcome. Risks in key aspects of our strategy
include not being able to deliver major systems implementations as expected, not being able to fully alleviate any
unanticipated events that affect business performance, not being in a position to finalize the disposal of certain
businesses as planned, not being able to achieve anticipated costs saving, failing to create higher value solutions that
differentiate us from local commoditized competitors, failing to deliver our core services effectively and consistently,
losing contracts or growth opportunities through price competition and market changes, failing to enter target markets
successfully, becoming over-reliant on large customers and government legislation changes potentially impacting on
our growth potential or force exit from markets and territories. Such risks or the materialization of such risks could
result in management distraction, or loss of key personnel or key customers or other events which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**We are involved in joint ventures over which we share control.**

Some of our operations are, or will be, conducted through jointly controlled entities and associated companies
where our degree of control, as well as our ability to identify and manage risks, may be reduced. Our joint venture
partners may (i) have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; (ii) be unable or unwilling
to fulfill their obligations under the relevant joint venture or other agreements; or (iii) experience financial or other
difficulties. In some instances, joint venture participants or contractual counterparties may be primarily responsible
for recruitment and screening. Further, we may not be able to control the decision-making process of the joint ventures
without reference to the joint venture partners and, in some cases, we do not have, or may not have, a majority control
of the joint venture. These risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.


-----

**Organized labor action or occupational health and safety laws and regulations could have a material adverse**
**effect on our operations.**

As of the date of this offering circular, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions,
approximately 26% of our employees were unionized. Although we believe that our relationships with our employees
are good, organized labor action at one or more of our facilities may occur, and any such activities, or any other labor
difficulties at our facilities or the facilities of any of our customers, could materially affect us.

In addition, we are subject to, among other laws and regulations, comprehensive occupational health and
safety laws and regulations and wage and hour laws, as applicable, in the various countries in which we operate. Such
laws and regulations may become more stringent and result in necessary modifications to our current practices and
facilities that could force us to incur additional costs that could materially affect us. Furthermore, any breach of
occupational health and safety laws and regulations could disrupt our business and have a negative impact on our
reputation, leading to financial and regulatory costs.

**Our business is at risk of criminal acts.**

Our business is subject to the threat of criminal acts of various types, such as robbery, attempted robbery and
theft, for example in connection with guarding and storing of valuable property, and also destruction and damage to
property, significant injury or loss of life of our employees, including as a result of terrorist attacks, armed attacks,
road safety, accidents on customer sites and mishandling or mismanagement of firearms. If the proportion of assets
and facilities stored or guarded by us that are lost or otherwise damaged through criminal acts increases or the amount
of incidents that occur while we are performing our services increases, the costs of our insurance may increase, and it
may also have a negative effect on our customers’ confidence in us. Particular criminal acts could result in us becoming
liable for compensation and costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations. Certain criminal threats, such as the threat of terrorist attacks, could also result in us incurring additional
personnel and other costs as a result of the need for enhanced security measures and compliance with expanded
security rules and regulations.

Furthermore, the products and services we sell to customers, and our servers and data centers on which our
data, and data of our customers, suppliers and business partners are stored, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data
protection breaches, malware, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering, despite our implementation of
network security measures. Our servers have in the past been subject to cyber-attacks. Any such event could
compromise the operations of our security services, our networks or those of our customers, and the information stored
on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could subject
us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, and could have a material adverse effect on
our business, operating results, and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation. Efforts to limit the
ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of our own security services efforts may be costly to
implement and met with resistance, and may not be successful.

Due to the type of services provided by us, we also face the risk of encountering losses due to employees
committing criminal acts. For example, our security business faces the risk of security guards attending alarm
responses committing theft at the customers’ premises. These factors may affect margins and profitability and
therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Any significant or prolonged disruption of our operations could constrain our ability to effectively serve our**
**customers.**

A disruption to our operations, including as a result of human error, inadequate internal or external processes
or systems, natural and other catastrophes, technological failure, external events and acts of third parties, could
constrain our ability to provide security services and fulfill our obligations to our customers, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business. We are exposed to various risks, such as outages and interruptions in the
connections between our alarms and our monitoring centers and larger-scale power failures or other catastrophes. We
are dependent on our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure. Telephone or other IT infrastructure failure,
incomplete backup routines, inadequate business continuity and disaster recovery plans, cyber security or other
external security breaches, viruses and other disruptive events could halt or delay out ability to service our customers,


-----

hinder our ability to conduct and expand our business, result in censures and fines by national governments in countries
in which we operate and result in significant remediation costs. Such disruptions could also cause loss of confidence
in our brand and loss of trust by our customers, especially those in government and financial sectors. In addition, given
the nature of our business, we continuously evaluate and implement upgrades to our IT infrastructure, as well as
develop new technology platforms to support new initiatives and product and service offerings. There are inherent
risks with upgrading such systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. While we believe we
are taking appropriate action to mitigate these risks through testing, training and staging implementation, we may not
be able to successfully launch these systems as planned or the systems may be implemented with disruptions to our
operations.

**Privacy concerns, such as consumer identity theft and security breaches, could hurt our reputation and**
**revenues, and our failure to comply with regulations regarding the use of personal customer data could**
**subject us to lawsuits or result in the loss of goodwill of our customers and adversely affect our business,**
**financial condition and results of operations.**

As part of our operations, we collect a large amount of private information from our customers, employees
and employee applicants. If we experience a breach of our data security, such private information may be at risk of
exposure. To the extent that any such exposure leads to credit card fraud or identity theft, or the misuse or distribution
of other data, including images taken by our photo detectors and cameras, we may experience a general decline in
customer confidence in our business, which may lead to an increase in our attrition rate or make it more difficult to
attract new customers. If we are unable to identify potential threats prior to a breach of our systems, customers may
lose confidence in our ability to protect their information. If customers become reluctant to use our services because
of concerns over data privacy, our ability to generate revenues would be impaired. In addition, if technology upgrades
or other expenditures are required to prevent security breaches of our network, boost general customer confidence in
our business, or prevent credit card fraud and identity theft, we may be required to make unplanned capital
expenditures or expend other resources. Any disruptions to our information technology system, breaches or
compromises of data or associated loss of confidence in our business or additional capital expenditure requirements
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**We may not be able to adequately protect our technologies or adequately enforce our intellectual property**
**rights; unauthorized use of or disputes involving our proprietary technology and processes may adversely**
**affect our business.**

Our success and competitive position depends in part on a combination of trade secrets and proprietary knowhow, as well as protection of our brands and trademarks. We use our in-house development team to design proprietary
products, including hardware and software protocols. We also cooperate with our network of manufacturing partners
to jointly develop new proprietary products and solutions. We have sought and received few patents covering such
proprietary technologies and therefore the legal protections covering our proprietary technologies from infringement
or other misuse may be inadequate. While we seek to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technologies and
trade secrets, through various methods such as entering into non-disclosure agreements with employees and third
parties and controlling access to our proprietary information, third parties nevertheless may try to copy or reverse
engineer portions our products, circumvent our security methods or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property.
The remedy for any breach of such protections may not be adequate to compensate us for the damages suffered.
Further, our competitors may independently develop competing technologies that are similar to our technologies
without misappropriating or infringing our intellectual property. Any access to or use by competitors of our technology
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we may be subject to claims of patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights infringement
by third parties. In developing technologies and systems, we may not adequately identify third party intellectual
property rights or assess the scope and validity of these third party rights. Accordingly, we may become subject to
lawsuits alleging that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others and seeking that we cease to use
the relevant technology. Intellectual property litigation could adversely affect the development or sale of the
challenged product or technology, require us to re-brand our products and offerings, or require us to pay damages or
royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Licenses may not be available to us on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all. Any such intellectual property litigation could represent a significant expense and divert


-----

our personnel’s attention and efforts and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**We are subject to risks from litigation or legal proceedings, as well as tax audits, which could adversely affect**
**our financial results and condition.**

From time to time we are involved in litigation and legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are difficult to
predict. For example, we face a number of wage and hour claims brought by former and current employees and
governmental agencies. We could become involved in legal disputes in the future that may involve substantial claims
for damages or other payments. These disputes may also divert management’s attention from the running of the
business and could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the company. In the event of a
negative outcome of any material legal proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a settlement agreement, we could
be obligated to make substantial payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Additionally, such outcomes could result in the withdrawal or non-renewal of
licenses, permits and/or permissions to operate or other penalties, fines or sanctions, and they could affect our relations
with current and potential customers and have an adverse impact on our reputation. In addition, the costs related to
litigation proceedings may be significant. Even in case of a positive outcome in such proceedings, we may still have
to bear part or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursed by the opponent, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be
subject to U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax audits. Any tax assessments, penalties, and interest, or
future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations.

During 2020, G4S Care and Justice Services (UK) Limited entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
(“DPA”) with the Serious Fraud Office (“SFO”) in the United Kingdom, in respect of the UK Care & Justice electronic
monitoring contract investigation which commenced in 2013. As part of the DPA, G4S agreed to pay an aggregate
amount of over £44 million. The DPA spans a period of three years, ending in July 2023, and requires G4S to take a
number of actions focused on strengthening the Care & Justice internal control environment. Failure to fulfil G4S’s
commitments as set out in the DPA could lead to the SFO seeking to prosecute the Care & Justice business. The SFO
is also conducting a criminal investigation into individual employees of G4S in relation to the above-described
conduct, in which three individuals were charged with seven offences of fraud. In 2019, a number of shareholders of
G4S brought a claim seeking damages for alleged losses following the reduction in G4S’s share price in 2013, as a
result of omitting information about the wrongful billing practices in respect of the G4S’s contract with the United
Kingdom government which is also subject to the DPA. In April 2020, G4S received requests for information from
the Belgian Competition Authority (“BCA”) and the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (“DoJ”) in
connection with G4S’ Belgian business. The BCA and the DoJ inquiries are ongoing and G4S is engaging and
cooperating fully with both authorities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, G4S recognized a charge of £43
million in respect of these inquiries after taking into account estimates of the potential financial penalties which might
arise on completion of the inquiry process ranging from £25 million to £50 million in the aggregate. There is a wide
range of possible outcomes in respect of these inquiries, including the potential imposition of material financial
penalties, third-party claims and/or debarment from certain tendering processes, which may lead to a potential
financial impact materially outside the currently estimated range of financial penalties.

G4S is also subject to various claims in the United States, including class action litigation accusing G4S of
performing employment-related background checks without fully complying with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and
claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act on behalf of American service members and civilians who were killed or injured
in Afghanistan, alleging that G4S provided support to the Taliban in Afghanistan. In January 2019, G4S also agreed
to settle a class action relating to claims for employee meal and rest breaks in California for a final payment of $110
million.

G4S is currently involved in a number of claims in India, mainly related to periods prior to 2011, in relation
to the interpretation of the basis for payments to the India Provident Fund. These disputes are currently awaiting court
resolution. G4S believes it has a strong legal position in defending against such claims, which amount to approximately
£50 million. While we cannot predict with any certainty the potential outcomes in respect of these proceedings, such
proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See
“Business—Legal Proceedings.”

**We rely on third party suppliers for certain parts of our security systems and any failure or interruption in**
**the provision of such products or failure by us to meet minimum purchase requirements could harm our**
**ability to operate our business.**

The security systems and other products that we install are manufactured by third party suppliers. Our
suppliers’ abilities to meet our needs are subject to various risks, including political and economic stability, natural
calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor issues. We are therefore susceptible to the
interruption of supply or the receipt of faulty products from our suppliers. For example, if suppliers for key
components fail to deliver products or experience delays in delivery, such difficulties may prevent us from upgrading
equipment, delivering products to our customer on time, or otherwise hinder our ability to install and upgrade systems
and provide replacement parts. This could result in higher costs to us and a potential decline in confidence in our
products and services among our customers.

We use these partnerships to supplement our own internal product development team. If these suppliers fail
to keep pace with technological innovations, we may incur increased product development costs or lose customers to
competitors with access to these technological innovations. Any interruption in supply, failure to produce quality
products or inability to keep pace with technological innovation by a supplier could adversely affect our operations,
as it may be difficult for us to find alternatives on terms acceptable to us, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**We are subject to risks associated with bidding for, entering into and mobilizing service contracts, many of**
**which are long-term contracts and/or on fixed price terms.**

The profitability of our contracts depends upon our ability to accurately price contracts to provide for a level
of return commensurate with the risks and the anticipated work involved. Our profitability also depends on our ability
to mobilize contracts effectively following awarding of a contract and to transition from mobilization to on-going
contract management.

Many service contracts we enter into, particularly those under which we provide more comprehensive
services and receive greater revenue, are complex, high-value contracts with multinational companies, governments
or strategic partners and are longer term commitments than our other contracts, which may result in us accepting
onerous contractual terms, may create on-going contract management issues, may result in inaccurate billing and may
result in ineffective management of subcontractors, and bidding for them requires us to make judgments on likely
future economics. Likewise, although contracts lasting several years generally include clauses that allow for price
adjustments due to inflation and other factors (such as increases in labor costs) we face the risk of not being able to
increase prices enough in order to fully compensate higher future costs, such as wages. Most of the sectors in which
we operate are price competitive, which can result in relatively thin margins under certain contracts, where even small
increases in costs or changes in scope relative to the assumptions in a bid may materially impact the profitability of
the relevant contract.

While we have recorded provisions in respect of certain contracts (some of which may be able to be extended
by the counterparty), no assurance can be given that such provisions will be sufficient to cover the losses ultimately
incurred under such contracts, that further provisions for such contracts will not be required in the future (particularly
in the event that any such contracts are extended by the customer), or that the costs of fulfilling other contracts will
not exceed the actual or expected economic benefit under such contracts resulting in further provisions for losses with
respect to certain contracts. If additional provisions and/or increased costs need to be recognized in the future, this
may result in lower returns, and economic, reputational and other impacts associated with onerous contracts which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**As an international business, we face various risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of**
**operations and financial condition.**

We have business operations in various jurisdictions around the world. Our international operations, which
represented approximately 33% of our pro forma combined revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 on
a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, subject us to complex and frequently changing laws and
regulations, including differing labor laws and regulations relating to the protection of certain information that we


-----

collect and maintain about our employees, clients and other third parties. Among these laws is the U.K. Modern
Slavery Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which
took effect in May 2018. Increasing regulatory scrutiny in relation to data protection may impose additional
compliance obligations and may also limit the extent to which customer data can be used to achieve our strategic
objectives. Such new or changing regulations may require modification of our processes and staff training and result
increased costs. The failure to comply with these laws or regulations could subject us to significant litigation, monetary
damages, regulatory enforcement actions, or fines in one or more jurisdictions. More generally, the economic,
political, monetary, and operational impacts of Brexit, including unanticipated impacts to the U.K. real estate market
and general economic conditions in the United Kingdom, could negatively impact our U.K. business, including
reducing our margins. These impacts remain highly uncertain, in particular, in respect of the U.K’s future access to
the European Union’s single market, its future regulatory environment and the free movement of capital and labor.
This market volatility may lead to an increase in our cost of borrowing and/or restrictions on the availability of credit
which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Additionally, the operating results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, and those
results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. There can be no assurance that the
foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our consolidated
financial condition and results of operations.

Further, as of the date of this offering circular, we operate in over 90 countries and have more than 550 legal
entities, with a significant number of local financial systems and processes. This can lead to an inherently diverse set
of processes and controls that rely on local capabilities for implementation and execution of controls. Due to
geographical span and decentralized structure of some of our international operations, coupled with the current
disparate systems landscape and evolving implementation and control environment, there can be no assurance that the
systems and controls in place will be effective in preventing or detecting any errors. If any errors are not prevented or
remain undetected, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects. In addition, as a result of our global presence, we face challenges in maintaining uniform culture, ethics
standards and values among our employees and customers.

**Geopolitical and political risks outside our control may adversely affect our business, financial condition,**
**results of operation and prospects.**

As of the date of this offering circular, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we operate
in over 90 countries across the world with wide-ranging government and political systems, differing cultural
landscapes and various degrees of rule of law, and within conflict and post-conflict zones. As a result, our present and
future operations could be adversely affected by factors such as general political volatility, revolution, military
intervention, insurgency, changes in government, changes in government policies, changes in laws and regulations
relating to foreign investment, trade and taxation, by social unrest and our ability to align with the environmental,
social and corporate governance expectations of our private sector clients as such expectations pertain to our
operations in certain jurisdictions, in addition to other political, economic and social risks. Such events could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on**
**our results of operations.**

We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or
more often if impairment indicators exist. We also review amortizing intangible assets and other long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. If the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or if as a result of a recoverability test
we conclude that the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, we would record an
impairment charge related to goodwill or intangible assets, respectively. The assumptions used to determine
impairment require significant judgment and the amount of the impairment could have a material adverse effect on
our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.

**In connection with the G4S Acquisition, we will be required to make cash contributions to our existing**
**pension obligations. In addition, we could be exposed to certain amounts of volatility associated with pension**
**deficits and employer contributions.**

In connection with the G4S Acquisition, Allied Universal, Allied Bidco and the trustee (the “G4S UK Pension
Trustee”) of G4S’s UK defined benefit pension scheme (the “G4S UK Pension Scheme”) entered into a memorandum
of understanding (the “Memorandum of Understanding”) dated December 8, 2020 setting out the parties’ intentions
with respect to the future funding of the G4S UK Pension Scheme. Under the terms of the Memorandum of
Understanding, in addition to certain support measures, Allied Universal will pay cash contributions to the G4S UK
Pension Scheme based on a funding shortfall of approximately £535 million reflecting the higher funding target agreed
with the G4S UK Pension Trustee. Allied Universal and the G4S UK Pension Trustee have also agreed on matters
relating to the potential impact of the Offer and certain possible future disposals on the G4S UK Pension Scheme.

In addition, calculating pensions requires our management to make assumptions in relation to various factors,
such as expected returns on plan assets and longevity of scheme members. Actual results could differ from the
assumptions made. We could be required to contribute additional amounts to our pension schemes, which could have
a negative impact on our future profitability.

**Risks Related to the G4S Acquisition**

**We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the G4S Acquisition or those benefits may take longer**
**to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the G4S business.**

Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the G4S Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our
ability to successfully integrate the G4S business. The integration of a business is a complex, costly and timeconsuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to
integrating our business practices and operations with the business practices and operations of G4S. The integration
process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the full realization of the anticipated
benefits from the acquisition. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the acquired business and to
realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could adversely impact the carrying value of the acquisition premium
or goodwill, could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our business activities, and could adversely
impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the overall integration of
G4S may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, loss of customers and diversion of the
attention of our management and employees. The challenges of integrating the operations of acquired businesses
include, among others:

  - difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from
the acquisition;

  - difficulties in the integration of operations and systems, including information technology systems;

  - difficulties in establishing effective uniform controls, standards, systems, procedures, business cultures,
compensation structures and accounting and other policies between the two businesses;

  - difficulties in the acculturation of employees;

  - difficulties managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company with a global presence;

  - difficulties in overseeing and ensuring compliance with complex and frequently changing laws and
regulations across multiple jurisdictions;

  - challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;

  - challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel, including personnel that are considered key to the future
success of the business; and


-----

  - challenges in keeping key business relationships in place.

Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs and
liabilities, decreases in the amount of expected revenue and earnings, and diversion of management’s time and energy,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
In addition, even if the operations of our business and G4S are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the G4S
Acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or cash flows that are
expected, and we will also be subject to additional risks that could impact future earnings. These benefits may not be
achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the
integration of G4S. In addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees,
inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain
relationships with our customer and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the G4S Acquisition. These
integration matters and our significant amount of indebtedness may hinder our ability to make further acquisitions and
could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period after the G4S Acquisition. All of these factors could
decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the G4S Acquisition or have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**We have incurred significant one-time transaction costs in connection with the G4S Acquisition.**

We have incurred, and expect to incur, significant one-time transaction and integration costs and capital
investments in connection with the G4S Acquisition. The substantial majority of these costs are non-recurring
expenses related to the G4S Acquisition. These costs and expenses are not fully reflected in the pro forma financial
information included in this offering circular.

**The future results of the combined company will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage**
**its expanded global operations following the G4S Acquisition.**

Following the G4S Acquisition, the size of the business of the combined company will have increased
significantly beyond the current size of either our business or G4S’s business. The combined company’s future success
depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for our
management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated
increased costs and complexity. We may not be successful in realizing the expected operating efficiencies, cost
savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated from the G4S Acquisition. Furthermore, we
have incurred and expect to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction
costs in connection with the G4S Acquisition. In addition, the continued integration of the two businesses could result
in additional costs and expenses that were not expected or anticipated, and such costs and expenses could materially
and adversely affect the prospects, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the combined
company.

**Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA contains anticipated benefits and adjustments that are necessarily**
**speculative and subject to certain management estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, no assurances can**
**be made that these benefits and adjustments will be realized in the amounts expected.**

Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA presented in this offering circular includes certain adjustments
related to anticipated benefits, synergies, improvements and cost savings relating to the G4S Acquisition. Adjustments
relating to the anticipated synergies resulting from the G4S Acquisition include cost savings as well as optimization
across the combined company. Such anticipated but unrealized benefits are necessarily speculative and subject to
certain management estimates and assumptions, as well as significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive
uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
Moreover, we estimate that the one-time costs to implement such synergies will be approximately $250 million. As a
result, no assurances can be made that the costs of achieving these benefits will not rise materially or that these benefits
or adjustments will be realized in the amounts expected. See “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro
Forma Combined Financial Information.”


-----

In addition, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA presented in this offering circular includes the effect of
certain run-rate adjustments as if they had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period presented, including
profit-improvement initiatives, unrealized acquisition synergies, pre-acquisition acquired EBITDA and other nonrecurring adjustments. We also present estimates of certain of these run-rate adjustments for prior fiscal periods. These
estimates have not been subject to any audit or review by any independent auditor, and they are based on certain
management assumptions and subject to uncertainty. We cannot guarantee that these amounts reflect the contribution
of these events if they had actually occurred at the beginning of the periods presented.

**The historical unaudited pro forma financial statements included in this offering circular are presented for**
**illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations**
**following the consummation of the Transactions.**

The historical unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements contained in this offering
circular are presented for illustrative purposes only, are based on various adjustments, assumptions and preliminary
estimates and may not be an indication of our actual financial condition or results of operations following
consummation of the Transactions. Our actual financial condition and results of operations following consummation
of the Transactions may not be consistent with, or evident from, these pro forma financial statements. In addition, the
assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information may not prove to
be accurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following consummation of
the Transactions. The Transactions may also give rise to unexpected liabilities and costs. The historical unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements have been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information.” The challenges associated with integrating previously independent businesses
makes evaluating our business and our future financial prospects difficult. Our potential for future business success
and operating profitability must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties typically
encountered following business combinations.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or our ability to operate our**
**business or react to changes in the economy or our industry, prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under**
**the notes offered hereby or our other indebtedness and divert our cash flow from operations for debt**
**payments.**

We have and, following the consummation of the Transactions, we will have a substantial amount of
indebtedness, which requires significant interest and principal payments. See “Description of Certain Other
Indebtedness.” As of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the issuers and
the guarantors would have had approximately $11,455.0 million in total indebtedness outstanding, none of which
would have been subordinated and of which approximately $9,120.0 million would have been senior secured
indebtedness (in each case excluding approximately $92.1 million of capital lease obligations), consisting entirely of
borrowings under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities (after giving effect to the ABL Credit Facility Increase
and excluding approximately $275.0 million of expected outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Credit Facility),
the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the secured notes offered hereby. In
addition, as of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the issuers would have
had $300.0 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, €300.0 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit
Facility and approximately $1,500.0 million (subject to a borrowing base) of availability to incur additional secured
indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility (excluding approximately $275.0 million of expected outstanding letters
of credit). Our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences to the holders of the notes offered
hereby, including the following:

  - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including debt service requirements under our outstanding
indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby;


-----

  - impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;

  - requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and
interest on our indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash
flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;

  - making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and limiting our
flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry;

  - compromising our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures as
compared to our competitors, including as a result of the restrictive covenants in the credit agreements that
govern the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture
governing the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the indenture governing the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and
the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby;

  - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to refinance indebtedness; and

  - causing potential or existing clients or vendors to not contract with us due to concerns over our ability to
meet our financial obligations.

In addition, any borrowings under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the secured notes offered hereby will be secured indebtedness and
therefore would be effectively senior to the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the unsecured notes offered hereby
and the related guarantees to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. See “Description of Secured Notes”
and “Description of Unsecured Notes.”

**Despite our indebtedness levels on the closing date after giving pro forma effect to the Financing**
**Transactions, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which could**
**further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ownership of the notes offered**
**hereby.**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including
secured indebtedness. The Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide aggregate availability of $2,020.0 million,
up to $300.0 million under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, all of which was undrawn as of the date of this
offering circular, and up to $1,500.0 million under the ABL Credit Facility (subject to a borrowing base), all of which
was undrawn as of the date of this offering circular (after giving effect to the ABL Credit Facility Increase and
excluding approximately $275.0 million of expected outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Credit Facility). The
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will provide aggregate availability of $1,819.3 million under the New First Lien
Term Loan Facilities and up to €300 million under the New Revolving Credit Facility, all of which was undrawn as
of the date of this offering circular.

Although the credit agreements that govern the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the credit
agreements that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the Existing 2026
Secured Notes, the indenture governing the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the indentures that will govern the
notes offered hereby contain or will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions
are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness that may be incurred in compliance
with these restrictions could be substantial. Furthermore, the restrictions in the credit agreements that govern the
Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the credit agreements that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the indenture governing the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the indenture governing the Existing 2027
Unsecured Notes and the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby do not prevent us from incurring
obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined in such debt instruments. If we incur
additional indebtedness above the levels that will be in effect on the closing date after giving effect to the Financing
Transactions, the risks associated with our leverage and the ownership of the notes offered hereby, including those
described above, would increase.


-----

If the issuers or the guarantors incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the secured notes
offered hereby and related guarantees, the holders of such additional indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with
the holders of the secured notes offered hereby in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency,
liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of the issuers or a guarantor, subject to any collateral
arrangements. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to the holders of the secured notes
offered hereby. Further, such secured debt would be effectively senior to the unsecured notes offered hereby and the
related guarantees to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service**
**obligations to increase significantly.**

Interest rates may fluctuate in the future. As a result, interest rates on the Existing Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or other variable rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than
current levels. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase
even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available
for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. In addition, a transition away from the London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as a benchmark for establishing applicable interest rate may affect the cost of
servicing our debt under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
the consequence of the phase-out of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted at this time.

**The credit agreements that govern the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the credit agreements that**
**will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the Existing 2026 Secured**
**Notes, the indenture governing the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the indentures that will govern the**
**notes offered hereby each impose or will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our**
**restricted subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.**

The credit agreements that govern the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the credit agreements that
will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the
indenture governing the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby
each impose or will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability
and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

  - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

  - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

  - make certain investments;

  - incur certain liens;

  - enter into transactions with affiliates;

  - merge or consolidate;

  - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments
to the issuers or the guarantors;

  - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

  - transfer or sell assets.

In addition, we and our restricted subsidiaries are and will be subject to covenants, representations and
warranties in respect of the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
including a financial covenant that governs and will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. See “Description of
Certain Other Indebtedness.”


-----

As a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to
raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.
The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We may not be able to
maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, there can be no assurance that we will
be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our existing
indebtedness and the notes offered hereby and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result
in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings
before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings as a result of the foregoing or otherwise, on less
favorable terms, or if we cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

**Our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of a**
**decline in our operating results or available cash or events beyond our control, could result in an event of**
**default that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.**

If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, such
as the failure to comply with the financial covenants contained in the credit agreements that govern the Existing Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the credit agreements that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable
immediately. By reason of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, other indebtedness may then become
immediately due and payable. Our assets or cash flows may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our
outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or
restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, including the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that
indebtedness. In addition, should an event of default occur, the lenders under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
our New Revolving Credit Facility and our ABL Credit Facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder,
cease making loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy
or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required
lenders under our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and New Senior Secured Credit Facilities to avoid being
in default. If we breach our covenants under our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs,
we would be in default under our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and New Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**Repayment of our indebtedness, including required principal and interest payments on the notes offered**
**hereby, is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond**
**our control.**

Our subsidiaries own a substantial portion of our assets and conduct all of our operations. Accordingly,
repayment of our indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our
subsidiaries and (if they are not guarantors of the notes offered hereby) their ability to make such cash available to us,
by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise.

Unless they are guarantors of the notes offered hereby, the issuers’ subsidiaries will not have any obligation
to pay amounts due on the notes offered hereby or to make funds available to the issuers or the guarantors for that
purpose. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable
us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby. Each non-guarantor subsidiary
is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to
obtain cash from our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

In the event that we are unable to receive distributions from subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required
principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby.


-----

**Claims of holders of the notes offered hereby will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of**
**certain of our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes offered hereby.**

The notes offered hereby will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. On the
issue date, the notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by (i) each of the Allied
issuer’s existing and future wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the Existing Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or that guarantee certain capital markets debt securities
of the issuers or any guarantor and (ii) each Issue Date Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor (subject to certain exceptions
and in accordance with certain agreed security principles). In addition, subject to certain exceptions and in accordance
with certain the agreed security principles) certain U.S. subsidiaries of the Allied issuer as well as certain foreign
subsidiaries incorporated in either Luxembourg or England and Wales will guarantee the notes by the later of (i) 150
days after the issue date and (ii) the date on which such foreign subsidiaries provide a guarantee under the Existing
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (subject to certain exceptions and in
accordance with certain agreed security principles). Claims of holders of the notes offered hereby will be structurally
subordinated to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and will not be
satisfied from the assets of these non-guarantor subsidiaries until their creditors are paid in full. As of and for the year
ended December 31, 2020, the Allied Universal co-issuers and guarantors (exclusive of G4S and its consolidated
subsidiaries) represented approximately 95.6% of Allied Universal’s total revenues, 85.0% of Allied Universal’s total
assets and 95.6% of Allied Universal’s total liabilities, after excluding intercompany transactions and balances. In
addition and subject to certain exceptions and certain agreed security principles, G4S and each of G4S’s material
subsidiaries incorporated in the United States, Luxembourg and England and Wales will guarantee the notes offered
hereby by the later of (i) 150 days after the issue date and (ii) the date on which such U.S. or foreign subsidiaries
provide a guarantee under our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, G4S entities organized in the United States, Luxembourg and
England and Wales represented approximately 49.0% of G4S’s total revenues and 61.0% of G4S’s total assets. In
addition, the guarantees of certain guarantors may be released under certain other circumstances, including in
connection with a transfer of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indentures that will govern the notes
offered hereby or upon certain other events described in “Description of Secured Notes—Guarantees” and
“Description of Unsecured Notes—Guarantees.” See “—There are circumstances, other than the repayment or
discharge of the notes offered hereby, under which the collateral will be released automatically, without your consent
or the consent of the collateral agent, and you may not realize any payment upon the release of such collateral.”

The indentures that govern the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and that
will govern the notes offered hereby permits or will permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain additional
indebtedness and does not or will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered indebtedness
thereunder.

**The unsecured notes offered hereby are unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our Existing Senior**
**Secured Credit Facilities, our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our Existing 2026 Secured Notes and our**
**secured notes offered hereby, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Existing Senior Secured**
**Credit Facilities, our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our Existing 2026 Secured Notes and secured**
**notes offered hereby.**

Our obligations under the unsecured notes offered hereby will be unsecured and will be effectively
subordinated to our secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured
indebtedness. Borrowings under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the secured notes offered hereby will be secured by substantially all
of the assets of the issuers and any existing and future subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exclusions), including
all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the issuers and certain of their wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries
directly owned by the issuers or the guarantors.

If an event of default occurs under the credit agreements that govern the Existing Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the credit agreements that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and/or the secured indenture
that will govern the secured notes offered hereby, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness will have a priority
right to the collateral that secures the secured notes offered hereby, to the exclusion of the holders of the unsecured
notes offered hereby, even if we are in default with respect to the unsecured notes offered hereby. In that event, such


-----

collateral would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by it (including all amounts
outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing
2026 Secured Notes and secured notes offered hereby), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to
satisfy the claims of the holders of the unsecured notes offered hereby and other unsecured indebtedness, including
the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any
foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the
unsecured notes offered hereby will participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and with all holders of
our unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as such notes, including holders of our Existing
2027 Unsecured Notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed
to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on
the unsecured notes offered hereby. As a result, holders of such unsecured notes offered hereby may receive less,
ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness.

As of December 31, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Financing Transactions, the issuers and the
guarantors would have had total indebtedness outstanding of $9,120.0 million other than the unsecured notes offered
hereby (excluding capital lease obligations), $5,102.9 million of which ranks senior in right of payment with the
unsecured notes offered hereby, consisting of secured indebtedness under the Existing Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the secured notes offered
hereby, and $2,335.0 million ranks equally in right of payment with the unsecured notes offered hereby, consisting of
unsecured indebtedness under the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Financing Transactions, we would have had an additional $300.0 million of
availability under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, €300.0 million of availability under the New Revolving
Credit Facility and $1,500.0 million (subject to a borrowing base) of availability under the ABL Credit Facility (after
giving effect to the ABL Credit Facility Increase and excluding approximately $275.0 million of expected outstanding
letters of credit) to incur additional secured indebtedness. In addition, we will be permitted to add incremental facilities
under the credit agreements that govern the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, subject to certain conditions being satisfied. The indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby
will also permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness, which could be substantial.

**Sales of assets by the issuers and the guarantors could reduce the collateral and the related guarantees.**

The security documents that will relate to the secured notes offered hereby allow the issuers and the
guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of
any income from, the collateral. To the extent the issuers or a guarantor sells any assets that constitute such collateral,
the proceeds from such sale will be subject to the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related
guarantees only to the extent such proceeds would otherwise constitute collateral securing the secured notes offered
hereby and the related guarantees under the security documents. Such proceeds will also be subject to the security
interests of certain creditors other than the holders of the secured notes offered hereby, some of which may be senior
or prior to the liens held by the holders of the secured notes offered hereby (including with respect to the ABL
Collateral), or may have a lien in those assets that is pari passu with the lien of the holders of the secured notes offered
hereby (including the liens on the collateral held by the lenders under the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility, the
Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the Existing 2026 Secured Notes). To the extent the proceeds from any sale of collateral do not constitute
collateral under the security documents, the pool of assets securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related
guarantees will be reduced, and the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees will not be secured by
such proceeds.

**The obligations of the issuers and the guarantors under our ABL Credit Facility, which are secured by a**
**portion of the same assets that will secure the secured notes offered hereby, together with any additional**
**secured indebtedness permitted to be secured by the ABL on a first-priority basis, are senior to the secured**
**notes offered hereby to the extent of the value of the ABL Collateral securing such indebtedness on a first-**
**priority basis.**

Obligations of the issuers and the guarantors under our ABL Credit Facility are secured, subject to certain
limitations and exceptions and permitted liens, by a first-priority security interest in the ABL Collateral. The secured
notes offered hereby and the guarantees thereof will be secured, and the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility, the


-----

Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the Existing 2026 Secured Notes are secured, in each case, subject to certain limitations and exceptions
and permitted liens, by a second-priority lien on all of such ABL Collateral. Subject to the terms of the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement, the liens on the ABL Collateral held by the holders of the secured notes offered hereby will,
therefore, be fully subordinated to the liens on the ABL Collateral held by our creditors under our ABL Credit Facility,
together with any additional secured indebtedness permitted to be secured by the ABL Collateral on a first-priority
basis, to the extent of the value of the ABL Collateral securing such indebtedness. Only when our obligations under
our ABL Credit Facility, and all other permitted first-priority indebtedness that is secured by such ABL Collateral, are
satisfied in full will the proceeds of such ABL Collateral be available, subject to other permitted liens, to satisfy
obligations under the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility, the Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the
secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees and other parity lien indebtedness on a pari passu basis.

**The value of the collateral securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees may not be**
**sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the secured notes offered hereby.**

Obligations under the secured notes offered hereby will be secured, together with the Existing 2026 Secured
Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other than the ABL Credit Facility) and the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, by first-priority liens on the collateral (other than with respect to ABL Collateral, which is secured
on a second-priority basis with respect to the secured notes offered hereby, the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility,
the Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the Existing 2026 Secured Notes). No appraisal of the value of the collateral has been made in connection
with this offering, and we cannot assure you that the value of the collateral is equal to or greater than our obligations
with respect to the secured notes offered hereby, the guarantees, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition, the fair market value of the
collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions. The
amount to be received upon a sale of the collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited
to, the actual fair market value of the collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability
of buyers. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be
substantial delays in its liquidation. The secured indenture that will govern the secured notes offered hereby will allow
us to incur additional secured debt, including, under certain circumstances, secured debt that will share in the collateral
that will secure the secured notes offered hereby and the guarantees. Accordingly, in the event of a foreclosure,
liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the
proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the issuers’ and the guarantors’
obligations under the secured notes offered hereby and the guarantees, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing
Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any future debt that is secured by the
collateral.

To the extent that pre-existing liens, liens that will be permitted under the secured indentures and other rights,
such as those securing certain purchase money obligations and capital lease obligations granted to other parties (in
addition to the holders of obligations secured by first-priority liens), encumber any of the collateral, those parties have
or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the collateral that could adversely affect the value of the collateral
and the ability of the collateral agent or the holders of the secured notes offered hereby to realize or foreclose on the
collateral.

The security interests in the collateral also will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the consent of a third-party may be required to obtain or
enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that any such consent could be obtained. We also cannot
assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when and if required to facilitate a foreclosure on such
assets. Accordingly, the collateral agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the
collateral may be significantly impaired. In addition, our business requires compliance with numerous U.S. federal,
state, provincial and local license and permit requirements, as well as, after giving effect to the Transactions, foreign
license and permit requirements. Continued operation of our properties that are part of the collateral will depend on
the continued compliance with such license and permit requirements to the extent applicable, and our business and
the value of the collateral may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with these requirements or changes in these
requirements. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require


-----

us to incur significant cost and expense. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental
authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfer are not
obtained or are delayed, the foreclosure may be delayed, our operations may be shut down and the value of the
collateral may be significantly impaired.

There may not be sufficient collateral to pay off any amounts we may borrow under the Existing Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our Existing 2026 Secured Notes and any other
secured indebtedness we incur that ranks pari passu with or prior to the secured notes offered hereby.

Consequently, liquidating the collateral may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts
due under the secured notes offered hereby, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing First Lien Term Loan
Facility, the Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities after satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with prior liens. If the proceeds of the
sale of the Notes Collateral and the ABL Collateral (subject to prior discharge of obligations under the ABL Facility)
are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the secured notes offered hereby, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the
Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility, the Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility and the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the holders of the secured notes offered hereby (to the extent
not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against our and the
guarantors’ remaining assets, which may not be sufficient to repay our obligations under the secured notes offered
hereby.

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the issuers or any of the guarantors that have guaranteed the
secured notes offered hereby, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors
will assert that the fair market value of the collateral with respect to the secured notes offered hereby on the date of
the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the secured notes offered hereby and all of
our other outstanding obligations secured by a senior or pari passu lien on the collateral. Upon a finding by the
bankruptcy court that the secured notes offered hereby are undercollateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding
with respect to the secured notes offered hereby would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured
deficiency claim, and such unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. In such
event, the secured claims of the holders of the secured notes offered hereby would be limited to the value of the
collateral. In addition, the holders of the secured notes offered hereby would not be entitled to receive post-petition
interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the secured
notes offered hereby exceeded the value of the collateral (after taking into account all other debt that was also secured
by the collateral on a senior or pari passu basis, including the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing 2026 Secured Notes), or any “adequate protection” on account of any
undersecured portion of the notes offered hereby.

**The rights of holders of the secured notes offered hereby in the ABL Collateral may be adversely affected by**
**the ABL Intercreditor Agreement.**

Under the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the liens on the ABL Collateral securing the obligations
under the ABL Credit Facility (or any replacement facilities), together with any other obligations permitted to be
secured by the ABL Collateral on a first-priority basis, rank senior to the liens on such ABL Collateral that will secure
our and the guarantors’ obligations under the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees. The ABL
Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility (or any replacement
facilities), together with any other obligations permitted to be secured by the ABL Collateral on a first-priority basis
(including post-petition interest, fees and expenses, whether or not allowed or allowable in any bankruptcy case), will
be paid with the proceeds of the ABL Collateral prior to the obligations under the secured notes offered hereby and
the related guarantees in certain circumstances, including in the event of any foreclosure by the lenders under the ABL
Credit Facility or a bankruptcy event. The lenders under the ABL Credit Facility, as holders of first-priority liens on
the ABL Collateral, control substantially all enforcement matters related to such ABL Collateral, pursuant to the terms
of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The holders of the permitted first-priority liens on the ABL Collateral, including
under the ABL Credit Facility, may cause the collateral agent under the ABL Credit Facility (the “ABL Agent”) to
dispose of, release, or foreclose on, or take other actions with respect to, the ABL Collateral (including certain
amendments of and waivers under the security documents with respect thereto) with which holders of the secured


-----

notes offered hereby may disagree or that may be contrary to the interests of holders of the notes offered hereby, even
after a default under the notes offered hereby in the case of an enforcement action by the ABL Agent.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement prohibits parties with second-priority liens on the ABL Collateral,
including the holders of the secured notes offered hereby, from foreclosing on such collateral at any time prior to the
payment in full of the permitted obligations secured by the ABL Collateral on a first-priority basis, including all
obligations under the ABL Credit Facility. To the extent the ABL Collateral is released from securing the obligations
secured by the ABL Collateral on a first-priority basis, including all obligations under the ABL Credit Facility, the
ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in certain circumstances (including in connection with the exercise of
remedies by the ABL Agent or in connection with a sale or other disposition of the ABL Collateral permitted under
the terms of the ABL Credit Facility and the secured indenture that will govern the secured notes offered hereby), the
second-priority liens securing the secured notes offered hereby in the Notes Collateral will automatically also be
released. In addition, the secured indenture that will govern the secured notes offered hereby and the security
documents related to the holders of such notes’ second-priority lien on the ABL Collateral may not be amended in
any manner that is prohibited by or inconsistent with the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement without the consent
of the ABL Agent and each other collateral agent party to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that has a permitted firstpriority lien on the ABL Collateral until such first-priority lien obligations are paid in full. The ABL Intercreditor
Agreement further provides that, under certain circumstances, the holders of the secured notes offered hereby would
be required to turn over to the holders of obligations under the ABL Credit Facility amounts they receive from the
issuers with respect to the ABL Collateral. We cannot assure you that in the event of a foreclosure by the holders of
the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility or a bankruptcy event, the proceeds from the sale of ABL Collateral
would be sufficient to satisfy all or any of the amounts outstanding under the secured notes offered hereby after
payment in full of the obligations secured by such first-priority liens on the ABL Collateral, including all obligations
under the ABL Credit Facility. See “Description of Secured Notes—Security.”

In addition, in the event of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, if the lenders under the ABL Credit
Facility desire to permit any use of cash collateral consisting of ABL Collateral or debtor-in-possession (“DIP”)
financing that is secured at least in part by the ABL Collateral, the holders of the secured notes offered hereby would
(assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place with respect to their liens on the Notes Collateral in
connection with such use of cash collateral or DIP financing) be limited in raising objections to such use of cash
collateral or DIP financing. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement also limits the right of the holders of the secured notes
offered hereby to raise various other objections or take various other actions in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding with respect to the ABL Collateral prior to the payment in full of the obligations under the ABL Credit
Facility, including, among other things, seeking relief from the “automatic stay” with respect to the ABL Collateral,
and also places certain restrictions on their right to seek “adequate protection” of their interests in the ABL Collateral
from a bankruptcy court, even though such holders’ rights with respect to such collateral were being affected.

**The collateral agent may not be the controlling collateral agent under the Pari Passu Intercreditor**
**Agreement.**

The rights of the holders of the secured notes offered hereby with respect to the collateral that will secure the
secured notes offered hereby are subject to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement
of enforcement proceedings against such collateral or to control such proceedings, will be initially at the direction of
the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent (as defined under “Description of Secured Notes”) until 120 days after the
occurrence of an event of default under the agreement governing and acceleration of the series of obligations
representing the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority (as defined
under “Description of Secured Notes”) and applicable notice from the collateral agent with respect to such obligations;
provided that such 120-day period shall be stayed with respect to any collateral if the Credit Agreement Collateral
Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing an enforcement action with respect to such collateral, the grantor of
the security interest in such collateral (whether any of the issuers or the applicable guarantor) is then a debtor under
or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding or if the Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent is stayed under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement from pursuing enforcement action with respect to
such collateral. In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling
collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the


-----

lien securing the secured notes offered hereby and the guarantees on such collateral will be automatically released and
discharged.

If the issuers issue additional indebtedness that is senior to or equal in priority to the lien securing the secured
notes offered hereby in the future in a greater principal amount than the secured notes offered hereby, then the
authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the collateral agent. Accordingly, the collateral agent may never have the right
to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the collateral.

In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral
agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien
securing the secured notes offered hereby on such collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided
that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first-priority obligations with
respect to any non-ABL Collateral and, with respect to the ABL Collateral, applied first to the secured parties under
the ABL Credit Facility and second, ratably among all of the then outstanding second-priority obligations (including
the secured notes offered hereby, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility, the
Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities)). The collateral so released will no longer secure the issuers’ and the guarantors’ obligations under the
secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees. The holders of the secured notes offered hereby will also
waive, certain important rights otherwise available to secured creditors in a bankruptcy, as the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement prohibits the Trustee and the collateral agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition
to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the collateral or to the use of cash
collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured
parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the collateral could
materially deteriorate, and holders of the secured notes offered hereby would be unable to raise an objection.

Also, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the secured notes offered
hereby obtain possession of any collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such collateral at any
time prior to the discharge of each of the other senior or pari passu obligations, then such holders will be obligated to
hold such collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of such obligations and, subject to the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement, promptly transfer such collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the
controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement among all the holders of such obligations. Thus, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the holders
of the secured notes offered hereby may be obligated to turn over to the other holders of the senior or pari passu
obligations any collateral, proceeds or payments they may receive.

**Many of the covenants in the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby will not apply to us if the**
**notes offered hereby are rated investment grade by two of Fitch, Moody’s and S&P.**

Many of the covenants in the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby will cease to apply to the
notes offered hereby during any periods in which such notes offered hereby are rated investment grade by two of
Fitch, Moody’s and S&P, provided that at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. The
notes offered hereby may never be rated investment grade, or if they are rated investment grade, the notes offered
hereby may not maintain these ratings. However, any suspension of the covenants under the indentures that will govern
the notes offered hereby would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these
covenants were in effect. To the extent any suspended covenants are subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us
while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of default under the indentures that will govern the
notes offered hereby. See “Description of Secured Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of Unsecured
Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure.**

The issuers’ obligations under the secured notes offered hereby and the guarantors’ obligations under the
guarantees will be secured only by the collateral described in this offering circular. The collateral agent’s ability to
foreclose on the collateral on behalf of the Secured Trustee and the holders of the secured notes offered hereby may
be subject to perfection, priority issues, state law requirements, applicable bankruptcy law, and practical problems


-----

associated with the realization of the collateral agent’s security interest in or lien on the collateral, including cure
rights, foreclosing on the collateral within the time periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining
third-party consents, making additional filings, statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure.
The consents of any third parties and approvals by governmental entities or courts of competent jurisdiction may not
be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, foreclosure on the collateral may not be
sufficient to make all payments on the secured notes offered hereby.

**Rights of holders of the secured notes offered hereby in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure**
**to create or perfect the security interests.**

The collateral that will secure the secured notes offered hereby will include substantially all of the issuers’
and the guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets which assets also secure the issuers’ and the guarantors’
indebtedness under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
Existing 2026 Secured Notes, whether now owned or acquired or arising in the future. Applicable law requires that a
security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through
certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the collateral securing the secured notes offered hereby
may not be perfected if we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. We will have limited
obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the secured notes offered hereby in specified collateral
other than the filing of financing statements. To the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not properly
perfected on the date of the issuance of the secured notes offered hereby, such security interest might be avoidable in
bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the collateral. See “—Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee may
be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

If additional material wholly-owned domestic, Luxembourg or UK restricted subsidiaries are formed or
acquired and become guarantors under the secured indenture that will govern the secured notes offered hereby,
additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such
guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required
to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after
the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property and rights are acquired and
identified. Neither the Secured Trustee nor the collateral agent will be responsible to monitor, and the issuers may not
inform the Secured Trustee or the collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute
collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired
collateral. None of the Secured Trustee, the collateral agent and the collateral agent for the Existing Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and the collateral agent for the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have any obligation to
monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or monitor the perfection of, or make
filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of, any security interests therein. Such inaction may result in the loss of
the security interest in such collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the secured notes offered hereby
and the guarantees against third parties. Even if the collateral agent does properly perfect liens on collateral acquired
or arising in the future, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under
certain circumstances or as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer. See “—Any future pledge of collateral or
guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy” and “—U.S. federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer
laws permit a U.S. court, under certain circumstances, to avoid the notes offered hereby and the guarantees, and the
liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes
offered hereby, the guarantees and the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees and/or
require holders of the notes offered hereby to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the
liens in respect of the secured notes offered hereby and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes
offered hereby.”

**Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the collateral.**

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the collateral that will secure the secured notes offered hereby
and guarantees thereof will reveal any or all existing liens on such collateral. Any such existing lien, including
undiscovered liens, could be significant, could rank prior to the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and
guarantees thereof and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the notes collateral agent to realize or foreclose
upon the collateral securing the secured notes offered hereby and guarantees thereof.


-----

**The imposition of certain permitted liens, under certain circumstances, will permit the liens on the related**
**assets securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees to be either subordinated to such**
**permitted liens or released. There are also certain other assets that are also excluded from the collateral.**

The indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure
additional indebtedness, including purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and, in the case of
certain of such liens, the liens on the related assets securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees
may, under certain circumstances, be either subordinated to such permitted liens or released. Our ability to incur
additional indebtedness and liens on such additional indebtedness in favor of third parties is subject to limitations as
described herein under the headings “Description of Secured Notes” and “Description of Unsecured Notes.” In
addition, certain assets are excluded from the collateral securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related
guarantees, as discussed under “Description of Secured Notes—Security.” If an event of default occurs and the
maturity of the secured notes offered hereby is accelerated, the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees
will rank pari passu with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness, including the unsecured notes offered hereby,
of the relevant obligor with respect to such excluded assets. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security
for the secured notes offered hereby is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the secured notes offered
hereby, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid.

**U.S. federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a U.S. court, under certain**
**circumstances, to avoid the notes offered hereby and the guarantees, and the liens securing the secured notes**
**offered hereby and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes offered hereby, the**
**guarantees and the liens securing secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees and/or require**
**holders of the notes offered hereby to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the**
**liens in respect of the secured notes offered hereby and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on**
**the notes offered hereby.**

The issuances of the notes offered hereby and the guarantees and, in the case of the secured notes offered
hereby and the related guarantees, the grant of liens by the issuers and the guarantors (including any future guarantees
and future liens) may be subject to review under U.S. federal and state fraudulent conveyance and fraudulent transfer
statutes (including U.S. federal bankruptcy laws), if an action (either in connection with a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization case or under a lawsuit in which a bankruptcy is not involved), were commenced at some future date
by the issuers, by the guarantors or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor. While the
relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes offered
hereby and the guarantees and, in the case of the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, the grant of
liens will generally be a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuances
of the notes offered hereby or guarantees or, in the case of the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees,
the grant of liens were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding other creditors or (ii) the issuers
or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return
for issuing either the notes offered hereby or a guarantee or, in the case of the secured notes offered hereby and the
related guarantees, the granting of liens and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true:

  - the issuers or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes offered
hereby, the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the secured notes offered hereby and
the related guarantees);

  - the issuances of the notes offered hereby or guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the
secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees) left the issuers or any of the guarantors with an
unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business in which such issuer or such guarantor was
engaged or about to engage; or

  - any of the issuer, the co-issuer or the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur
indebtedness beyond our or its ability to pay as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuances of the notes offered hereby or a guarantee or, in the case of the
secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, the grant of liens was a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent


-----

transfer, the court could avoid the payment obligations under the notes offered hereby or such guarantee in total or in
part or further subordinate the notes offered hereby or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of
the issuers or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes offered hereby to repay any amounts received with
respect to the notes offered hereby or such guarantee or, in the case of the secured notes offered hereby and the related
guarantees, avoid the liens to secure the secured notes offered hereby or the related guarantees. In the event of a finding
that a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes offered
hereby. Further, the avoidance of the notes offered hereby could result in an event of default with respect to our other
debt and that of the guarantors that could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary
depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a
court would use to determine whether or not the issuers or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or,
regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the issuers or a guarantor was indeed
insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes offered hereby (including under the guarantees)
did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuances
of the notes offered hereby and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the issuers’ or any guarantor’s other
indebtedness.

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

  - the sum of its indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;

  - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable
liability on its existing indebtedness and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute
and mature; or

  - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation,
property is transferred or a valid antecedent indebtedness is satisfied. A court would likely find that the issuers or a
guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes offered hereby or such
guarantee and/or lien if such issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the
issuance of the notes offered hereby or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally
challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the issuers’ benefit,
and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less
than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could avoid the obligations under the
guarantees (and any related liens with respect to the secured notes offered hereby), subordinate them to the applicable
guarantor’s other indebtedness or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes offered hereby.

To the extent a court avoids (x) any of the guarantees as fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers or
holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the notes offered hereby or the related
guarantees would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable guarantor or (y) in the case of liens granted to
secure the secured notes offered hereby or the related guarantees, the holders of the secured notes offered hereby
would cease to have a secured claim against the issuers or the guarantors, as applicable. If a court were to hold a
guarantee unenforceable, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s
other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee of the notes offered hereby. Sufficient
funds to repay the notes offered hereby may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors,
if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the issuers or the
applicable guarantor.

Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes offered hereby will contain a provision
intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence
of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be
effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent


-----

transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee
worthless.

In addition, as noted above, any payment by the issuers pursuant to the notes offered hereby or by a guarantor
under a guarantee made at a time such issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be avoided and required
to be returned to the issuers or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the issuers’ or such guarantor’s creditors
if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any
non-insider party and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party (as the case may be) more than such
creditor would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the
notes offered hereby or the guarantees to other claims against the issuers or the guarantors under the principle of
“equitable subordination,” if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes offered hereby engaged in some type
of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair
advantage upon the holder of the notes offered hereby; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**Each guarantee and the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby will be subject to certain limitations**
**on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity**
**and enforceability.**

Each guarantor’s guarantee will provide the holders of the notes offered hereby with a direct claim against
such guarantor. In addition, the issuers and the guarantors will secure the payment of the secured notes offered hereby
by granting security under the relevant security documents. However, each security interest granted under a security
document will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest.
Furthermore, the security documents and the indentures will provide that the security interest in the collateral securing
the secured notes offered hereby and the guarantees of the notes offered hereby will be limited to the maximum amount
that can be provided without rendering the relevant security interest guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under
the applicable laws of Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, the United States or any other jurisdiction. Enforcement of
each guarantee or security document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses
include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally. See “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests
and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws,
guarantees and security interests can be challenged (by the bankruptcy receiver or trustee, in case of bankruptcy of the
relevant guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such guarantor outside bankruptcy), and a court could declare
unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any legal act performed by a
guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the guarantees of the notes or the security interests
granted to benefit the secured notes offered hereby under the security documents) and, if payment had already been
made under a guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a security document, require that the recipient (and
possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found, _inter alia,_
that:

      - the amount paid or payable under the relevant guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant security document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;

      - the relevant guarantee or security interest under a security document was incurred with actual intent
to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, even
when the recipient was simply aware that the guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant
guarantee or security interest;

      - the guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting the
relevant guarantee or security interest and the guarantor: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent


-----

because of such guarantee or security interest; (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized
because of such guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would
incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or

      - the relevant guarantees or security documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the
guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the guarantor.

The payment of dividends to the issuer to meet its obligations in respect of the notes or to provide a dividend
to our shareholders will reduce the distributable profits and reserves that would be available to the guarantors to satisfy
their obligations under the guarantees and security documents. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we will
have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the guarantees and security documents
whether or not we pay dividends. In addition, making a payment under the guarantees or enforcing security interests
under the security documents may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not
limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions. If such corporate formalities are
required in connection with enforcement of a security interest in the collateral securing the secured notes or making a
payment under a guarantee, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete these corporate formalities or
that we do so in a timely manner.

**The insolvency laws of Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to**
**you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the notes offered hereby from recovering**
**payments due on the notes offered hereby.**

The LuxCo co-issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Certain of the guarantors are
incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and England and Wales. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Luxembourg, the United Kingdom or another relevant jurisdiction.
Your rights under the notes offered hereby, the guarantees and the collateral securing the secured notes offered hereby
will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that
you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the LuxCo co-issuer’s and the
relevant guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with,
each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, rights of insolvency
administrators to challenge transactions, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain postpetition
interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into
question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights
under the notes offered hereby and the guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.
See “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain
Insolvency Law Considerations” with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above.

**Changes in, or uncertainty relating to, the EURIBOR and LIBOR calculation process may adversely affect**
**the interest we pay on the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.**

Certain of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will bear interest at interest rates based on EURIBOR
and/or LIBOR. See “Description of Certain Indebtedness—New Senior Secured Credit Facilities—Interest.”
EURIBOR and LIBOR are deemed to be “benchmarks” and have been the subject of recent national and international
regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be
implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely,
or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions,
to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the
EU (which, for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark
administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise
recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that
are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed).


-----

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities if the
methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks
Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting
the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national
reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering
or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements.

Specifically, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned as a result of the absence of relevant active
underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of benchmark reforms) for market
participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. The UK Financial Conduct Authority has indicated through
a series of announcements that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after
2021. Separately, the euro risk free rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and
high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro denominated cash products
(including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among other things, that continuing to
reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area
financial system.

It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, LIBOR and EURIBOR will continue
to be supported going forward. This may cause LIBOR and EURIBOR to perform differently than in the past, and
may have other consequences which cannot be predicted., Such factors may have (without limitation) the following
effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a
benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the
disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of
international or national reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in
reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay on borrowings under the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest
expense could correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow.

**Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.**

Collateral pledged or perfected upon, or guarantees issued, after the issue date of the notes offered hereby
may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were pledged or perfected upon to secure, or delivered to guarantee,
as applicable, previously existing indebtedness. Any future pledge or perfection of collateral or issuance of a guarantee
in favor of the holders of the secured notes offered hereby (including any Liens delivered or reinstated after the
Reversion Date and/or pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the issue date of the secured
notes offered hereby) or any future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the unsecured notes offered
hereby (including pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the issue date of the unsecured notes
offered hereby) may be avoidable by the ledger (as a debtor in possession), guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by
its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including,
among others, if (1) the ledger or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or perfection and/or issuance of the
guarantee, (2) the pledge or perfection and/or issuance of the guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the
secured notes offered hereby or the unsecured notes offered hereby (as applicable) to receive a greater recovery in a
hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if such pledge or perfection and/or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and
(3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the ledger or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge
or the perfection thereof as the case may be, and/or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain
circumstances, one year. Accordingly, if the issuers or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the
issue date of the notes offered hereby and any pledge of collateral not pledged, or any guarantees not issued, on the
issue date of the notes offered hereby had been pledged or perfected or issued (as applicable) less than 90 days before
commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such pledges or guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided
as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the issue date of the notes offered hereby (even if the other
guarantees or liens (as applicable) issued and/or perfected on the issue date of the notes offered hereby would no
longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant or perfection of any such security interest and/or guarantee
is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as
applicable) and could have to return payments or property to us.


-----

**Rights of holders of the secured notes offered hereby in the collateral may be adversely affected by**
**bankruptcy proceedings.**

The right of the collateral agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral securing the secured
notes offered hereby and the related guarantees is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by
federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against the issuers or the guarantors that
provide security for the secured notes offered hereby or the related guarantees prior to, or possibly even after, any
collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor,
such as the collateral agent, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a
bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court
approval (which may not be given under the circumstances or which could be delayed). Moreover, bankruptcy law
permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral,
even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given
“adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but
it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral and may include cash
payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion
determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or
disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court
may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if
the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term
“adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it
is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the secured notes offered hereby could be made
following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether
any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the collateral agent could or would repossess
or dispose of the collateral, the value of the collateral as of the commencement date of any bankruptcy proceedings or
any other date, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the secured notes offered hereby would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of the collateral through the requirements of “adequate
protection.”

Furthermore, any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of
business would also require approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances or
which could be delayed).

Also, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all
amounts due on the secured notes offered hereby and all of our other outstanding First Lien Obligations (as defined
under the headings “Description of Secured Notes”) the holders of the notes offered hereby would be “under-secured.”
U.S. bankruptcy laws do not provide for the payment or accrual of interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees on the
under-secured, “deficiency” portion of a creditor claims during a debtor’s bankruptcy case nor is a creditor entitled to
adequate protection on account of any under-secured portion of its claims.

In addition, as noted above, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the Secured Trustee and the
collateral agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to proposed debtor-in-possession financing
to be provided to us that is secured by the collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or
objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and
limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the
secured notes offered hereby would be unable to raise an objection.

**Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, avoided or released under**
**certain circumstances, the holders of the notes offered hereby may not receive any payments from some or all**
**of the guarantors.**

Holders of the notes offered hereby have the benefit of the guarantees of the guarantors. However, the
guarantees by the guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under
applicable law. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon (among
other things) the amount of other obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully
above, a court under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and fraudulent transfer statutes could avoid the obligations


-----

under a guarantee (and any related security interest) or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor.
See “—U.S. federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a U.S. court, under certain
circumstances, to avoid the notes offered hereby and the guarantees, and the liens securing the secured notes offered
hereby and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes offered hereby, the guarantees and the
liens securing secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes offered
hereby to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens in respect of the secured notes
offered hereby and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes offered hereby.” In addition, you
will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description
of Secured Notes—Guarantees” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Guarantees.”

**The Agreed Security Principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the notes**
**offered hereby.**

The Agreed Security Principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the notes offered
hereby to require granting of, or payment or enforcement under, a guarantee or security in certain circumstances. The
operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any
guarantee or security provided by any subsidiary being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or
class of assets and/or not perfected. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the guarantees
and Collateral provided by us and our subsidiaries. The validity and enforceability of the guarantees and security may
also be affected by local law limitations.

**We may not be able to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indentures that will**
**govern the notes offered hereby.**

Upon a change of control, as defined under the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby, holders
of the notes offered hereby will have the right to require the issuers to offer to purchase all of the notes offered hereby
then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes offered hereby plus accrued interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the
outstanding notes offered hereby, we expect that we would have to refinance the notes offered hereby. We may not
be able to refinance the notes offered hereby on reasonable terms, if at all. The issuers’ failure to offer to purchase all
outstanding notes offered hereby or to purchase all validly tendered notes offered hereby would be an event of default
under the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of
our other indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes. Our future debt
also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute
a change of control under the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain specified asset sales, the issuers will be required to offer to
purchase outstanding notes offered hereby, outstanding Existing 2026 Secured Notes, outstanding Existing 2027
Unsecured Notes, indebtedness under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and indebtedness under the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities, at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but excluding, the date of purchase. The source of funds for any such purchase of the notes offered hereby will be the
issuers’ available cash or cash generated from the issuers’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of
assets or sales of equity. The issuers may not be able to purchase the notes offered hereby upon such an asset sale
offer because the issuers may not have sufficient financial resources at the time of such asset sale to make the required
purchase of notes and such other indebtedness, or because restrictions in the issuers’ other indebtedness will not allow
such purchase of the notes offered hereby. Any of the issuers’ future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.
Accordingly, if such an asset sale were to occur, the issuers may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase
the notes offered hereby and such other indebtedness that the issuers would be required to offer to purchase or that
become immediately due and payable as a result. The issuers may require additional financing from third parties to
fund any such purchases, and we may not be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. See “Description
of Secured Notes—Asset Sales” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Asset Sales.” The issuers’ failure to pay
holders tendering notes and such other indebtedness upon such an asset sale would result in an event of default under
the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby.


-----

**We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged transactions**
**that do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the notes offered**
**hereby.**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indentures that
will govern the notes offered hereby, constitute a “change of control” that would require the issuers to purchase the
notes offered hereby, notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness
or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes offered hereby. Among other
things, the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby offered hereby provides that a sale of the majority of
the equity interest in Allied Universal will not constitute a change of control so long as the Investor Group owns at
least 35% of the equity interests following such sale. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations, which would not constitute a change
of control under the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby, but that could increase the amount of
indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.

**An active trading market may not develop for the notes offered hereby.**

There is currently no established trading market for the notes offered hereby, and there can be no guarantee
that an active trading market for the notes offered hereby will develop. The initial purchasers have advised us that
they currently intend to make a market in the notes offered hereby. However, they are not obligated to do so and they
may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the notes offered hereby at any time without notice.
Although we will make application to the Authority for the non-USD notes to be listed and to be admitted to trading
on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot guarantee the liquidity of any market that may develop for such notes.
In addition, we do not intend to apply for listing of the USD notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of such
notes in any automated dealer quotation system. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading
market for, any of the notes offered hereby.

The liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes offered hereby may also be adversely affected by, among
other things:

  - changes in the overall market for securities similar to the notes offered hereby;

  - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

  - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

  - the number of holders of the notes offered hereby;

  - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes offered hereby;

  - the conditions of the financial markets; and

  - prevailing interest rates.

The condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely
to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the notes offered hereby.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities that are similar to the notes offered hereby. The market, if any, for any
of the notes offered hereby may not be free from similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect
the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes offered hereby
may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar
notes, our performance, and other factors.


-----

**There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes offered hereby.**

The notes offered hereby are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes offered hereby in
the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite
period of time. The issuers are not obligated to register the notes offered hereby under the Securities Act or to offer to
exchange the notes offered hereby in an exchange offer registered under the Securities Act. As a result, for so long as
the notes offered hereby remain outstanding, they may be transferred or resold only in transactions exempt from the
registration requirements of federal and applicable state securities laws.

**A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may adversely**
**affect the market price or liquidity of the notes offered hereby.**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Credit
rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their overall
view of our industry. The notes offered hereby will have a non-investment grade rating on the issue date.
Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the notes
offered hereby. Such rating may not remain for any given period of time or be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a
rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as
adverse changes, so warrant. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the notes offered hereby,
and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect of risks
relating to the structure or marketing of the notes offered hereby. If the credit rating of the notes offered hereby is
subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your notes without a substantial
discount.

Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain
additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to the notes offered hereby is subsequently lowered or
withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your notes at a favorable price or at all.

**There are circumstances, other than the repayment or discharge of the secured notes offered hereby, under**
**which the collateral will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the collateral agent,**
**and you may not realize any payment upon the release of such collateral.**

Under various circumstances, the collateral will be released automatically, without action by, or consent of,
any holder of the secured notes offered hereby or the Secured Trustee under the secured indenture that will govern the
secured notes offered hereby, at the discretion of lenders under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including:

  - upon a sale, transfer or other disposition of such collateral (to a person that is not an issuer or a guarantor) in
a transaction not prohibited under the secured indentures will govern the notes offered hereby. See
“Description of Secured Notes—Release of Collateral;”

  - with respect to collateral held by a guarantor of the secured notes offered hereby, upon the release of such
guarantor from its guarantees;

  - pursuant to the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, upon any release in connection with a
foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to such Collateral by the controlling collateral agent in
accordance with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement;

  - pursuant to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, upon any release in connection with a foreclosure
or exercise of remedies with respect to such collateral by the controlling collateral agent in accordance with
the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement; and

  - if the secured notes offered hereby have achieved Investment Grade Status.


-----

The secured indenture that will govern the secured notes offered hereby also permits us to designate one or
more of the issuers’ restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the secured notes offered hereby as an unrestricted
subsidiary. If the issuers designates a guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the secured indentures,
all of the liens on any collateral owned by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the secured
notes offered hereby by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the secured indentures.
Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the collateral securing the secured notes
offered hereby to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In
addition, the creditors of any such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of the
unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries senior to the claim of the holders of the secured notes offered hereby.

You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the notes offered
hereby, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those
non-guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally senior to claims of noteholders.

**Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby by**
**beneficial owners with short positions in excess of their interests in the notes offered hereby will be**
**disregarded.**

By acceptance of the notes offered hereby, each holder of notes agrees, in connection with any notice of
Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or
take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written representation to the Issuers and the Trustee
that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its investment in the notes offered
hereby (other than screened affiliates) are not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is
being instructed solely by beneficial owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under
“Description of Secured Notes” and “Description of Unsecured Notes”) and (ii) provide the Issuers with such other
information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s
representation within five business days of request therefor. Holders of the notes offered hereby, including Holders
that have hedged their exposure to the notes offered hereby in the ordinary course and not for speculative purposes,
may not be able to make such representations or provide the requested additional information. These restrictions may
impact a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder Directions.

**We will not be subject to the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.**

Since we are not a public company and the notes offered hereby will not be registered under the Securities
Act after this offering, we will not be subject to the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”), which
requires, among other things, public companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures to
ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review the effectiveness of those controls on
a quarterly basis. SOX also requires public companies to have and maintain effective internal controls over financial
reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial
statements, and have management review the effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have the
independent auditor attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls). We will not be required to comply with these
requirements and therefore we may not have comparable procedures in place as compared to other public companies.

**The indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act,**
**and we are not, and we will not be, required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act.**

The indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act,
and we are not, and we will not be, required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore,
holders of the notes offered hereby will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust
Indenture Act except to the extent there are similar provisions in the indentures that will govern the notes offered
hereby.


-----

**The Investor Group controls us, and the Investor Group’s interests may conflict with ours or those of the**
**other holders of the notes offered hereby.**

The Investor Group collectively indirectly owns, through its ownership in Topco, the majority of our limited
liability company units. In addition, pursuant to the limited liability company agreement of Topco, the Investor Group
controls Topco. As a result, the Investor Group has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction
and has the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of the manager or equityholder of us or Topco,
regardless of whether the holders of notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For
example, the Investor Group could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness,
including secured indebtedness, or to sell assets, which may impair our ability to make payments under the notes
offered hereby. In addition, to the extent permitted by the credit agreements that govern our Existing Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, the credit agreements that will govern our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indentures
governing our Existing 2026 Secured Notes and Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the indentures that will govern
the notes offered hereby, the Investor Group may cause us to pay dividends rather than make capital expenditures or
otherwise use our funds for the benefit of our business.

In addition, the Investor Group is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to
time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The Investor Group may vote
in a manner so as to restrict us from expanding our business or entering into additional lines of business, which may
be related to the current or future operations of these investments. Also, the Investor Group may pursue acquisitions
that may be complementary with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to
us. So long as the Investor Group continues to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our
limited liability company units, even if such amount is less than 50%, the Investor Group will continue to be able to
strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.

**Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and**
**financial condition.**

We are subject to complex tax laws. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including
our effective tax rate or tax payments. We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and
regulations. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these
laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require
us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such
taxes, which could increase our costs of operations or our effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**While the issuers intend to treat interest paid on the USD secured notes tranche 2, the euro secured notes and**
**the sterling secured notes as foreign source interest, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service may treat it as U.S.**
**source.**

Although the issuers are co-issuing the notes, the net proceeds of the USD secured notes tranche 1 and the
unsecured notes will be received and used by, and all amounts due on those notes are expected to be paid by, the
Allied issuer, whereas the net proceeds of the USD secured notes tranche 2, the euro secured notes and the sterling
secured notes will be received and used by, and all amounts due on such notes are expected to be paid by, the LuxCo
co-issuer. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the issuers intend to treat the USD secured notes tranche 1 and the
unsecured notes as being issued by the Allied issuer and interest on such notes as U.S. source, and treat the USD
secured notes tranche 2, the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes as being issued by the LuxCo co-issuer
and interest on such notes as foreign source.  However, there is no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(the “IRS”) would not challenge such treatment. If the IRS were to successfully challenge such treatment, interest on
the USD secured notes tranche 2, the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes may be treated as U.S. source,
and any non-U.S. investor holding such notes may be subject to withholding at 30%.


-----

**The non-USD notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Exchange.**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the non-USD notes on
the Official List of the Exchange. However, there can be no assurance that the non-USD notes will become or remain
listed. If the issuers cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List
thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the issuers may cease to make or
maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the notes on the Exchange does not imply
that a public offering of any of the notes in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man has been authorized. Although no
assurance is made as to the liquidity of the non-USD notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange
or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be approved for listing of the non-USD notes
on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange or the delisting of the non-USD notes
from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a holder’s ability to
resell non-USD notes in the secondary market.

**You may face foreign currency exchange as a result of investing in the notes offered hereby.**

The euro secured notes will be denominated and payable in euro and the sterling secured notes will be
denominated and payable in sterling. If you are a US investor, an investment in these notes will entail foreign exchange
related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro or sterling, as applicable
relative to the US dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation
of the euro or sterling against the US dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the relevant notes below
their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a US dollar basis.

**The terms of the ABL Credit Facility Increase have not yet been finalized and the New Senior Secured Credit**
**Facilities have not yet been fully syndicated.**

The credit agreement relating to the ABL Credit Facility Increase has not been finalized and the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities have not yet been fully syndicated. Our ability to successfully syndicate the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and successfully obtain the ABL Credit Facility Increase is subject to market conditions and
we cannot assure you that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the ABL Credit Facility Increase will be
successfully syndicated or obtained on the terms described herein. Future changes in market conditions may result in
changes to the terms for the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the ABL Credit Facility Increase, including
pricing, that are less favorable to us and may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our business.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering, after deducting initial purchaser discounts and
commissions, will be approximately $     million. As further described in the table and the accompanying footnotes
below, we intend to use such proceeds to (i) repay in full borrowings outstanding under the Bridge Credit Facilities
and terminate all available borrowings thereunder and (ii) pay related fees, costs, premiums and expenses.

The table below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions,
assuming they occurred on December 31, 2020 (giving effect to the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the
Bridge Credit Facilities and the termination of all available borrowings thereunder with the net proceeds of the
issuance of the notes offered hereby) and based on estimated amounts outstanding on that date. Actual amounts will
vary from the estimated amounts shown below depending on several factors, including, among others, accrued interest
on our indebtedness subsequent to December 31, 2020, changes made to the sources of the contemplated financings
and differences from our estimated fees, costs and expenses.

The net proceeds from the offering of the USD secured notes tranche 1 and the unsecured notes will be
received and used by, and all amounts due on those notes are expected to be paid by, the Allied issuer. The net proceeds
from the offering of the USD secured notes tranche 2, the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes will be
received and used by, and all amounts due on those notes are expected to be paid by, the LuxCo co-issuer.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

On April 6, 2021, Allied Bidco, a newly incorporated entity that is indirectly controlled by Allied Universal
announced that its recommended Offer for G4S had become unconditional in all respects. Under the terms of the
Offer, as set out in full in the offer document published by Allied Bidco dated January 5, 2021, G4S shareholders are
entitled to receive 245 pence in cash for each G4S share. The Offer was made to G4S shareholders resident in the
United States in reliance on, and compliance with, Section 14(e) of the US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E
thereunder, as a “Tier II” tender offer (as set forth in Rule 14d-1(d) under the US Exchange Act).

The acquisition of G4S will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as per the
provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”), with Allied Universal
representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements were prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of the acquisition. For each of the periods presented, the
pro forma financial information reflects the combination of historical financial information of Allied Universal and
G4S, adjusted to give effect to the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 based on a
preliminary purchase price allocation, and as subsequently described in greater detail. Furthermore, additional pro
forma adjustments have also been reflected to show impacts of financing to effect the acquisition, addresses
differences in reporting currencies, differences in bases of accounting, and differences in the classification and
presentation of certain financial information, and shows the effects of the adoption of certain accounting standards.
For purposes of certain disclosures that follow, Allied Universal and G4S may be referred to collectively as the
“Combined Company.”

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, and the unaudited
pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, are presented herein.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines the unaudited consolidated balance sheets of
Allied Universal and G4S as of December 31, 2020 and gives effect to the acquisition and financing for the
acquisition as if it occurred on December 31, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations combines the historical results of Allied Universal and G4S for the year ended December 31, 2020 and
gives effect to the acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020. The historical financial information has been
adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that address differences in reporting currencies, differences in bases
of accounting, differences in the classification and presentation of certain financial information, and the adoption of
certain accounting standards.

The pro forma adjustments included in this document are subject to modification based on the final
determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, additional analysis, and additional
information that may become available, which may cause the final adjustments to be materially different from the
pro forma condensed combined financial statements presented below. Following the consummation of the G4S
Acquisition, Allied Universal management will perform a detailed review of G4S’s accounting policies in an effort
to determine if differences in accounting policies require further reclassification of G4S’s results of operations or
reclassification of assets or liabilities to conform to Allied Universal’s accounting policies and classification. As a
result, Allied Universal may subsequently identify additional material differences in the accounting policies which
could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma combined financial information.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presented is for informational
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been
realized if the G4S Acquisition had been completed on the dates set forth above, nor is it indicative of future results
or financial position of the combined company. Additionally, the final determination of the purchase price and the
purchase price allocation, upon the completion of the G4S Acquisition, will be based on G4S’s net assets acquired
as of that date and will depend on a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect any anticipated synergies or dissynergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the G4S Acquisition or potential divestitures
that may occur prior to, or subsequent to, the completion of the G4S Acquisition or any acquisition and integration
costs that may be incurred. The pro forma adjustments, which Allied Universal believes are reasonable under the
circumstances, are preliminary and are based upon available information and certain assumptions described in the
accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. Actual results and


-----

valuations may differ materially from the assumptions within the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the
notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and G4S’s audited financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2020 below, as well as Allied Universal’s audited consolidated financial statements
and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**(In USD thousands, except per share data and as otherwise noted)**

**Note 1 – Description of Business Combination**

On April 6, 2021, Allied Bidco, a newly incorporated entity that is indirectly controlled by Allied Universal
announced that its recommended Offer for G4S had become unconditional in all respects. Under the terms of the
Offer, as set out in full in the offer document published by Allied Bidco dated January 5, 2021, G4S shareholders are
entitled to receive 245 pence in cash for each G4S share (the G4S Acquisition). The Offer was made to G4S
shareholders resident in the United States in reliance on, and compliance with, Section 14(e) of the US Exchange
Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder, as a “Tier II” tender offer (as set forth in Rule 14d-1(d) under the US Exchange
Act). On April 13, 2021, Allied Bidco announced that it had received acceptances under the Offer in respect of, or
otherwise acquired, not less than 90% in value of the G4S shares to which the Offer relates and of the voting rights
carried by those shares, and would therefore exercise its rights in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006 to
acquire compulsorily the remaining G4S shares in respect of which the Offer has not been accepted. In addition,
Allied Universal, Allied Bidco and the G4S UK Pension Trustee of the G4S UK Pension Scheme entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding setting out the parties’ intentions with respect to the future funding of the G4S UK
Pension Scheme. Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, in addition to certain support measures,
Allied Universal will pay cash contributions to the G4S UK Pension Scheme based on a funding shortfall of
approximately £535 million reflecting the higher funding target agreed with the G4S UK Pension Trustee. Allied
Universal and the G4S UK Pension Trustee have also agreed on matters relating to the potential impact of the Offer
and certain possible future disposals on the G4S UK Pension Scheme. Such commitment to funding per the
Memorandum of Understanding is accounted for as a liability assumed in the application of purchase accounting
under ASC 805.

**Note 2 – Basis of Presentation**

The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial information is based on the historical financial
statements of Allied Universal and G4S as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, are presented herein. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined balance sheet combines the unaudited consolidated balance sheets of Allied Universal and G4S
as of December 31, 2020 and gives effect to the G4S Acquisition as if it occurred on December 31, 2020. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations combines the historical results of Allied Universal
and G4S for the year ended December 31, 2020 and gives effect to the G4S Acquisition as if it occurred on January
1, 2020. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that address
differences in reporting currencies, differences in bases of accounting, and differences in the classification and
presentation of certain financial information and reflect transaction accounting adjustments, as well as other
adjustments deemed to be directly related to the G4S Acquisition, irrespective of whether such adjustment is deemed
to be recurring. Any adjustments for differences in bases of accounting are determined after taking into effect the
impacts of purchase accounting.

Allied Universal is deemed to be the accounting acquirer and the pro forma adjustments are preliminary
and are based on estimates that are subject to change. The combined group will not be a “foreign private issuer” as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act and Rule 3b-4(c) under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the pro forma
information of the combined group is prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations was prepared using the historical
audited consolidated statement of operations of Allied Universal for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the
historical audited consolidated income statement of G4S for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Allied Universal’s historical audited financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and
presented in thousands of U.S. dollars. G4S plc’s group consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies


-----

Act 2006 and with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as
it applies in the European Union (IFRS) and presented in millions of Sterling (GBP). Certain reclassifications were
made to align G4S’s financial statement presentation with that of Allied Universal based on information available to
date, (see Note 5). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations also includes transaction
related adjustments including certain purchase accounting adjustments, (see Note 6). Following the consummation
of the G4S Acquisition, Allied Universal management will conduct a detailed review of the accounting for the G4S
Acquisition and as a result of that review, Allied Universal management may identify differences that, when
finalized, could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.

**Note 3 – Purchase Price**

Estimated consideration of the acquisition of approximately $5,324 million (translated from GBP to USD at
the April 6, 2021 spot rate) is based on G4S shareholders receiving a collective £3,829 million in cash based on the
Tender Offer price of 245 pence (translated into $3.41 at the April 6, 2021 spot rate) per share of G4S stock..

Allied Universal purchased approximately 90% of G4S outstanding and issued Shares on April 6, 2021 and
intends to acquire the remaining 10% of outstanding G4S Shares in the months subsequent to the closing of the
Tender Offer. If Allied Universal did not acquire the remaining noncontrolling interest, there would have been $532
million of noncontrolling interest on the balance sheet, and G4S net profit attributable to such 10% noncontrolling
interest would have been as follows:

**G4S Historical net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ........................** **$** **9,682**
Elimination of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on

existing G4S debt .................................................................................................. $ 9,404
Estimated make-whole and prepayment penalty on extinguishment of G4S debt ....... (9,800)
Acceleration of LTIP and RSP vesting upon change of control ................................... (2,339)
**Total potential adjustments .......................................................................................** **(2,735)**

**Potential adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ..................** **$** **6,947**

For avoidance of doubt, the unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not include the
potential adjustments listed in the table above.

**Note 4 - Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation**

Under the acquisition method of accounting, G4S’s assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the
date of acquisition and combined with the historical carrying amounts of Allied Universals’ assets and liabilities. For
this purpose, fair value shall be determined in accordance with the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, “Fair
_Value Measurements and Disclosures,” (“ASC 820”). Fair value is defined in ASC 820 as “the price that would be_
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date.” Fair value measurements can be highly subjective and can involve a high degree of estimation.
In the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet, the purchase price paid by Allied Universal to
acquire G4S has been allocated to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill based upon management’s
preliminary estimate of respective fair values as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information includes a preliminary allocation of the purchase price based on
assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable under the circumstances, are subject to changes, which
may be material.

Allied Universal has not completed a full, detailed valuation analysis necessary to determine the fair values
of G4S’s identifiable assets to be acquired, liabilities to be assumed and noncontrolling interest. The preliminary
calculation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed performed for the purposes of these unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements was primarily limited to the identification and calculation of preliminary
values for the intangible assets and deferred taxes. The calculations necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed have been performed based on proprietary benchmarking information, publicly
available information, as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market participant assumptions. Where
practicable, the benchmark information was corroborated with an income approach methodology. Allied Universal


-----

will continue to refine its identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as further
information becomes available. Refer to Note 6E for the range of fair value estimates of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed.

The final determination of the purchase price allocation is anticipated to be completed as soon as
practicable and will be based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition
closing date. The final amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed could differ significantly from
the amounts presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Such final allocation
could result in significantly different amortization and depreciation expense due to differing allocations of purchase
price between definite versus indefinite lived intangible assets, or depreciating tangible assets.

The purchase price is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the
midpoint of their respective estimated fair values, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill as follows
(in USD thousands):

Cash consideration .................................................................................................. **$** **5,324,451**
Cash and Cash Equivalents ..................................................................................... 2,049,716
Accounts receivable, net ......................................................................................... 1,197,734
Other assets acquired ............................................................................................... 1,848,298
Identifiable intangible assets acquired .................................................................... 2,484,901
**Estimated fair value of total assets acquired (net of Goodwill) .........................** **7,580,649**

FV of pension funding obligation assumed[(1)] .......................................................... 773,444
Accounts payable .................................................................................................... 253,865
Loan notes ............................................................................................................... 3,618,600
Unfavorable contracts provision ............................................................................. 28,622
Other liabilities assumed ......................................................................................... 2,424,281
**Estimated fair value of total liabilities assumed .................................................** **7,098,812**

**Estimated fair value of net acquired assets .........................................................** **$** **481,837**

**Goodwill .................................................................................................................** **$** **4,842,614**

(1) Allied Universal incurred a liability that is an estimated $773 million in cash payments to be made by Allied
Universal through fiscal year 2026 in order to fund an existing deficit in the G4S pension scheme. $177
million is reflected on the balance sheet in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the remaining
$596 million is reflected in Other liabilities, and represents payments to be made between fiscal years 2022
and 2026. Further, as any deduction related to pension plan contributions would result in a net operating loss
(“NOL”) and the Combined Company has no expectation of realizing the benefit of such NOL due to it being
a loss making entity, no deferred tax asset was recorded.

**Note 5 – Financial Statement Translation of and Adjustments to G4S’s Historical Financial Statements to**
**Conform to U.S. GAAP**

G4S’s consolidated statement of financial position and statement of income as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differs in certain material respects from
U.S. GAAP and Allied Universal’s accounting policies. This balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and statement
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been adjusted to align G4S’s historical balance sheet as of
December 31, 2020 and statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 to Allied Universal’s U.S.
GAAP accounting policies after taking into effect the impacts of purchase accounting.

For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, the
historical financial information of G4S was translated from Sterling (GBP) to US dollars (USD) using the following
historical exchange rates:


-----

**Period of Exchange Rate** **£ / $**

period ..................................................................................................................................................... 1.284

**Reclassifications and Other Transaction-related Adjustments**

**Translation and Grouping of G4S Historical Financial Statements**

G4S has historically prepared and reported its financial information in Sterling (GBP). However, Allied
Universal’s reporting currency is the US dollar (USD). Accordingly, G4S’s historical financial information was
translated from GBP into USD, and grouped into certain Allied Universal financial statement line items prior to
inclusion in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Information regarding
G4S’s historical financial information both prior to and subsequent to translation and grouping as well as the foreign
currency exchange rates at which such information was translated into US dollars, is summarized below:

_Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet - As of December 31, 2020:_

For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31,
2020, G4S’s audited consolidated statement of financial position (balance sheet) as of December 31, 2020 was
translated from GBP to USD using the following foreign currency exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2020
£1.00 to $1.363. The following table illustrates the impact of translating G4S’s consolidated statement of financial

_Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations – Year ended December 31, 2020:_

For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations as of
December 31, 2020, G4S’s audited consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 was
translated from GBP to USD using the following weighted-average foreign currency exchange rate for the period:
£1.00 to $1.284. The following table illustrates the impact of translating G4S’s consolidated income statement for

**Reclassification adjustments**

**A.** In addition to the translation and grouping of G4S historical financial information to align to Allied
Universal’s financial statements reporting currency and line items, the following summary
represents reclassifications to conform G4S historical financial information to financial statement
line items and presentation of the Combined Company based on Allied Universal’s accounting
policies:

_G4S Balance Sheet Reclassification Adjustments:_

i. Trade and other receivables of $231.7 million reclassified to Unbilled services rendered;


-----

ii. Trade and other receivables of $282.7 million reclassified to Prepaid and other current
assets;
iii. Non-acquisition-related intangible assets of $136.3 million reclassified to Property and
equipment, net;
iv. Trade and other payables of $816.3 million reclassified to Accrued payroll and related
payroll taxes
v. Trade and other payables of $585.7 million reclassified to Accrued expenses and other
current liabilities
vi. Accrued claims reserves, net of current portion of $24.0 million reclassified to Other
liabilities
vii. Uniform costs of $38.3 million reclassified from Inventories to Property and equipment,
net.
viii. Inventory of $103.8 million reclassified from Inventories to Prepaid and other current
assets.

_G4S Statement of Operations Reclassification Adjustments_

i. Specific items – charges and credits, net (acquisition costs - legal & professional fees) of
$0.2 million to G4S Acquisition and related costs
ii. Long term incentive plans (LTIPs) comp expense in General and administrative expense
of $11.2 million to Non-cash equity-based compensation expense
iii. Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets of $15.4 million to General and
administrative
iv. Restructuring and separation costs of $75.7 million to General and administrative
v. Serious fraud office deferred prosecution agreement of $66.7 million to General and
administrative
vi. Bid defense of $43.6 million to G4S Acquisition and related costs
vii. Share of post-tax profit from joint ventures of $5.0 million to Other
viii. Loss on disposal of fixed assets of $3.8 million to loss on disposal of property and
equipment.
ix. Impairments of property and equipment and leased right of use assets of $4.8 million from
Asset impairment to General and administrative
x. Specific items of $67.9 million to General and administrative

**Conforming Accounting Policies**

The following adjustments have been made to align G4S’s historical balance sheet as of December 31,
2020 and statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 to Allied Universal’s accounting policies
after taking into effect the impacts of purchase accounting:

**B.** **Uniforms.** Represents an adjustment to record a reversal of accumulated depreciation related to
capitalized uniform costs as Allied Universal’s policy is to depreciate uniforms over three years
whereas G4S expenses uniforms over two years. The balance sheet impact is an estimated increase
of $21.8 million to Property and equipment, net, offset by a $5.5 million decrease to Deferred tax
assets. The net impact to the statement of operations is an estimated reduction of $2.6 million to
Direct expenses.

**C.** **Leases. Represents an adjustment to record the reversal of G4S’s lease related balances recognized**
in accordance with IFRS 16 – Leases (“IFRS 16”) to align with the recognition of leases under ASC
840, _Leases (“ASC 840”), as applied by Allied Universal. The balance sheet impact results in a_
derecognition of Right of use assets (Property and equipment, net) and net investments in finance
lease assets (Deposits and other long-term assets) of $309.3 million and $8.2 million, respectively,
that was offset by an additional recognition of $17.7 million of net investment in finance lease asset
in Property and equipment, net. There was an additional derecognition of a short-term and longterm IFRS 16 lease liability of $118.6 million and $260.3 million, respectively, offset by a
recognition of short-term and long-term finance (capital) lease liabilities per ASC 840 of $6.8


-----

million and $19.1 million, respectively. There was a further derecognition of Deferred tax assets of
$19.1 million to reflect the tax impacts of the reversals. The net impact to the statement of operations
involves a reversal of depreciation on right of use assets presented as Direct expenses of $63.1
million, a reversal of General and administrative expenses of $42.1 million, and a reversal of Interest
expense recognized on lease liabilities of $22.6 million. Such reversal has been offset by the
recognition of operating lease rental expenses presented in Direct expenses and in General and
administrative expenses of $84.2 million and $54.9 million, respectively.

**D.** **Goodwill Impairment.** Represents an adjustment to record a reversal of goodwill impairment
analyzed at the cash generating unit level per International Accounting Standards Board (“IAS”) 36

          - Impairment of Assets due to the expectation that impairment analysis at the reporting unit level per
U.S. GAAP would not result in any impairment. The adjustment results in an increase to Goodwill
of $78.7 million on the balance sheet, and a corresponding reversal of Goodwill impairment of $74.1
million, net of $4.6 million of currency translation impact on the statement of operations.

**E.** **Onerous Contracts. Represents an adjustment to remove the current and non-current provision of**
$4.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, relating to onerous contracts recognized by G4S in
accordance with IAS 37 – Provisions (“IAS 37”) but not recognized under U.S. GAAP. This balance
sheet impact is offset by an associated $5.5 million reduction in the Deferred tax asset balance. To
record the impact of the reversal of onerous contract provision balances in the statement of
operations for the period ended December 31, 2020, the expense of $9.0 million recognized during
2020 for future losses is reversed from General and administration expense and is instead,
recognized as an in-year loss in Direct expense.

**F.** **Defined Benefit Schemes.** Represents an adjustment to record a $61.6 million increase in Other
expense, net. This adjustment also results in an additional tax expense of $7.7 million. There is no
balance sheet impact as a result of this adjustment, as any adjustments made to Other comprehensive
income would be eliminated due to the application of purchase accounting.

**G.** **Hedge Accounting. Represents an adjustment to record $21.8 million in Interest expense as a result**
of the unwinding of hedge accounting from Other comprehensive income into Interest expense. This
adjustment results in an associated tax expense of $6.4 million. There is no balance sheet impact as
a result of this adjustment, as any adjustments made to Other comprehensive income would be
eliminated due to the application of purchase accounting.

**H.** **Cloud Computing Costs.** Represents an adjustment to reverse a balance of $31.3 million from
Intangible assets, net for capitalized implementation costs on cloud computing software provided to
G4S as a service. Such costs are not capitalizable for entities such as Allied Universal who have not
yet adopted ASU 2018-15. This reversal is offset by an associated $8.2 million increase in deferred
tax assets.

**I.** **Unremitted Earnings.** Represents an adjustment of $47.4 million to record the recognition of
deferred tax on unremitted earnings in accordance with ASC 740.

**Note 6 –Transaction Adjustments**

Adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma financial information are represented by the following:

**A.** **Purchase Price.** Represents an adjustment to record the cash purchase consideration of $5,324
million paid in the Tender Offer. Refer to Note 3 for additional details regarding the calculation of
the cash purchase consideration.

**B.** **Equity Financing.** Represents an adjustment to reflect cash received of $1,067 million from the
issuance of Allied Universal shares.


-----

**C.** **Debt. Represents an adjustment to reflect an increase to long-term debt and capital lease obligations,**
net of debt issuance costs, of $1,761 million in First Lien Term Loans and $4,329 million in the
notes offered hereby to, directly or indirectly, finance the cash consideration paid in the Tender
Offer, in addition to $10.5 million of capitalized revolving facility fees. The adjustment also reflects
the extinguishment of G4S’s outstanding current and non-current debt of $772 million and $2,367
million, respectively, upon consummation of the acquisition.

The adjustment to record interest expense on the notes offered hereby and First Lien Term Loans and
related accretion of debt issuance costs is shown below. Interest expense adjustments for the notes offered hereby
and the First Lien Term Loans assume the notes offered hereby and the First Lien Term Loans were issued or
incurred on January 1, 2020 and were outstanding for the entire year ended December 31, 2020, and that all related
debt issuance costs have been recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020. The interest rates assumed for
purposes of preparing this pro forma financial information are the Euro, USD, and Sterling London Inter-Bank
Offered (“LIBO”) rates of 0% (based on a 0% floor), 0.63%, and 0.3%, respectively, plus an applicable margin. The
LIBO rate is the average one-month LIBOR for the year ended December 31, 2020 for each respective currency.
The extinguishment of G4S’s existing debt and accretion of related unamortized debt issuance costs in addition to
interest expense related to notes offered hereby and the First Lien Term Loans results in a net increase in interest
expense. The following adjustments have been recorded to interest expense, and result in an offsetting $135.0
million income tax benefit based on a blended statutory tax rate of 26%:

-----

A 1/8 of a percentage point increase or decrease in each currency’s LIBOR would result in a change
in interest expense of approximately $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**D.** **Transaction Costs: Represents an adjustment to reflect the accrual of additional transaction costs**
incurred by Allied Universal and G4S after December 31, 2020 and results in a $68.2 million
increase to Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the balance sheet and a $68.2 million
increase to G4S Acquisition and other related costs on the statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2020. These costs will not affect the Combined Company’s statement of operations
beyond one year after the acquisition date.

**E.** **Intangible Assets: Represents an adjustment to reflect acquired identifiable intangible assets**
consisting of trademark, technology and customer relationships, at the midpoint of the estimated
fair values of $2,485 million. The adjustment also reflects incremental amortization expense of $225
million on such acquired intangible assets in General and administrative. Management has
performed a preliminary valuation analysis to determine the fair value of each of the identifiable
intangible assets using the “income approach.” Application of the income approach requires
management to forecast the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible assets, which
are then discounted to their present value. The preliminary valuation of acquired identifiable
intangible assets includes a range of values based on a percentage of purchase price as shown below.
Pro forma adjustments for amortization and determination of goodwill in Note 6G assumes the
midpoint of the fair value ranges provided below.

The following table summarizes the estimated range of fair values of G4S’s identifiable intangible assets,
the range of fair values as a percentage of the purchase price, their estimated useful lives, and amount of
amortization recognized on such identified intangible assets under a straight line method of amortization (in
USD thousands) for the year ended December 31, 2020:

The estimated tax impact of $646.1 million increase to deferred tax liability from establishing the
intangible assets above at fair is reflected in the balance sheet using the blended statutory tax rate of 26%.

**F.** **Unfavorable Contracts: Represents an adjustment to reflect the off-market component of acquired**
long-term revenue contracts of $24.5 million in Other long-term liabilities and $4.1 million in
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. This balance sheet impact is offset by an associated
$5.5 million increase in the Deferred tax asset balance Any revenue recognition associated with the
elimination of the off-market component over the pro forma period is immaterial.

**G.** **Goodwill: Represents an adjustment to reflect estimated goodwill of $4,843 million recognized**
from the acquisition, derived using the midpoint of the fair value estimate of net assets acquired (see
Note 4 and Note 6E), and the elimination of historical G4S goodwill of $1,848 million.

**H.** **Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowances: There are no significant adjustments to the deferred**
tax asset valuation allowance that will need to be recorded through purchase price allocation given
G4S currently has Net Operating Losses (“NOL”) across various jurisdictions in which there are no
deferred tax assets. As there is no expectation that the Combined Company would be allowed to
utilize any incremental NOLs, there is no incremental deferred tax asset to be recorded.


-----

**I.** **Equity: Represents an adjustment to eliminate G4S’s historical shareholders’ equity of $646**
million.

**J.** **Compensation Arrangements: Represents an adjustment to reflect Allied Universal’s expectation**
to record a one-time compensation expense of $23.4 million related to the acceleration of unvested
G4S Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP) and Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) shares in contemplation
of the acquisition. This amount is reflected as Non-cash equity-based compensation expense in the
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and as a reduction to retained earnings
in the balance sheet at December 31, 2020. The estimated tax benefit of $6.1 million associated with
this adjustment assumes such compensation expense is deductible using a blended statutory tax rate
of 26%.

**K.** **Disposals: Represents an adjustment to reflect the effects of the disposal of G4S’ cash handling**
business, including the elimination of income (loss) from operations, and corresponding assets and
liabilities attributable to the disposed business that was not acquired by Allied Universal as part of
the acquisition. The impact of this adjustment on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020 is as
follows:

**Assets of disposal group** **Adjustment**
Goodwill ...................................................................................................... $    18,581
PPE and non-acquisition-related intangible assets ....................................... 14,141
Accounts receivable, net .............................................................................. 14,614
Prepaid and other current assets ................................................................... 1,520
Cash and cash equivalents ............................................................................ 27,355
**Total assets of disposal group ........................................................................... $** **76,211**

**Liabilities of disposal group**

**Total liabilities of disposal group .....................................................................** **$** **(27,664)**

**Net adjustment for disposal group ...................................................................** **$** **(48,547)**

The impact of this adjustment on the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020
is as follows:

**Adjustment**
**Revenue ..............................................................................................................** $ (55,593)
**Direct expenses ...................................................................................................** 39,744
**Gross Profit ........................................................................................................** $   (15,850)

**Operating costs and expenses:**

**Loss from operations .........................................................................................** (7,522)
Other .................................................................................................................... (678)

**Loss before income tax expense (benefit).........................................................** $   (8,201)

The estimated tax benefit of $2.1 million associated with the removal of net income before income
tax expense (benefit) is reflected in the statements of operations using the blended weighted average
statutory tax rate of 26%.


-----

**L.** **Impact of ASC 842 Adoption: Allied Universal will adopt ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) as of**
January 1, 2021. The adjustments represent the recognition of the balance sheet gross up of G4S
and Allied Universal’s right of use assets (“RoU Assets”) and lease liabilities as if ASC 842 was
adopted on December 31, 2020. This results in the recognition of G4S’ RoU Assets in Property and
equipment, current Lease liabilities, Lease liabilities, net of current portion, and Member’s capital
of $309.4 million, $118.6 million, $260.3 million, and $50.4 million, respectively. There was a
recognition of $102.2 million and $83.1 million in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities,
respectively, to reflect the tax impacts of these adjustments related to recognition of right of use
assets and lease liabilities. This also results in the recognition of Allied Universal’s RoU Assets in
Property and equipment, current Lease liabilities, and Lease liabilities, net of current portion of
$68.8 million, $23.5 million, and $45.3 million, respectively. These adjustments do not have any
impact to the statement of operations.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND**

**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon_
_financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read together with the_
_applicable consolidated financial statements, the notes to those financial statements and the other financial_
_information appearing elsewhere in this offering circular._

_Unless otherwise specified, this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results_
_of Operations” relates only to the historical results of Allied Universal and its subsidiaries, and does not give effect_
_to the Transactions. Capitalized terms used in this section shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section_
_unless the context provides otherwise._

**Business Overview**

Allied Universal is North America’s leading security and facility services provider. With over 250,000
security professionals and offices located throughout the United States as well as internationally (Canada, Mexico,
and the United Kingdom), Allied Universal serves approximately 14,800 clients and is responsible for protecting more
than 50,000 client sites covering multiple specialty sectors such as higher education, healthcare, retail, commercial
real estate, government, and corporate campuses, including a significant portion of the Fortune 500 companies. Allied
Universal’s services span manned guarding, innovative technology systems, risk and consulting, janitorial and staffing
services, integration services, and digital solutions and remote monitoring.

We are responsible for providing “best-in-class” security services that allow clients to completely outsource
the recruiting, screening, hiring, training, uniforming, scheduling and supervision of security officers. Our security
officers work on-location at customer sites and are responsible for observing, detecting, deterring and reporting and
responding to perceived, potential or actual security threats. We also provide specialized security services such as
vehicle patrol, visitor management, K-9 security services, top security facility cleared security professionals, and joint
security programs. We have an operational presence in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and
have a growing presence in Canada, Latin America, and the United Kingdom.

In addition to providing manned guarding services, we provide comprehensive technology solutions to our
customers, including video surveillance, CCTV picture capture and monitoring, robot patrolling, GPS-based patrol
and reporting, management of access control points and centralized security operations. We also offer systems
integration services to design, install and service fully integrated technology-based monitoring systems, along with
digital solutions and remote monitoring through our MaRC. We are able to leverage our large manned guarding
customer base and service platform to cross-sell these additional system integration services. Finally, we offer a range
of ancillary services, including temporary and permanent staffing, event staffing and security, janitorial services, and
consulting and investigation solutions.

Allied Universal was formed in August 2016 through the combination of AlliedBarton and Universal, which
brought together two of the leading providers in the security services industry. AlliedBarton, founded in 1957, and
Universal, founded in 1965, were leaders in the industry in customer service, organic growth, customer and employee
retention, accretive M&A, and had a highly complementary and diverse set of blue chip customers. The combined
company became the largest provider of security officer services in North America and has continued to grow since,
both organically and through M&A. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Allied Universal acquired U.S. Security Associates
Holdings, Inc., a leading North American provider of security solutions, including manned security, consulting,
investigations, and disaster and emergency response services. Since 2007, the company has successfully executed 72
acquisitions, including small and large tuck-ins. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Allied announced the acquisition of
SOS Security, which brought a complementary approach and further scale to Allied Universal. As of 2020, Allied
Universal has an estimated 31% share of the highly fragmented outsourced manned guarding security services market
in the United States, with a track record of growth driven both organically and through acquisitions.

**Recent Developments**

On February 3, 2020, we issued an additional $540.0 million aggregate principal amount of Existing 2026
Secured Notes under an indenture dated July 12, 2019 (the “Existing Secured Indenture”) with Wilmington Trust,
National Association, as the Trustee and as the Notes Collateral Agent. The additional Secured Notes were issued in
a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Holders of the
additional Secured Notes are not entitled to any registration rights. The proceeds from the additional Secured Notes
were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility and provide working capital and funds
for other general corporate purposes of the Company. During March 2020, we borrowed $500.0 million under the
ABL Credit Facility out of an abundance of caution in response to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic.
After not using any of the additional cash provided by this borrowing, we repaid the $500.0 million in full during
August 2020.

On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
(the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19
pandemic which, among other things, contains numerous income tax provisions. The CARES Act allows us to defer
the payment of the employer share of social security taxes for the period beginning March 27, 2020 through December
31, 2020. Based on the CARES Act, we deferred $282.0 million of qualified payroll tax payments as of December 31,
2020, of which $141.0 million is recorded within accrued payroll and related taxes and $141.0 million is recorded
within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The current portion of this liability is due by December 31,
2021 with the remainder due by December 31, 2022. Additionally, we were able to deduct additional Section 163(j)
interest carryforward amounts as a result of the increase in the limitation provided by the CARES Act. We will
continue to monitor future guidance issued regarding the CARES Act to determine any future impacts.

On April 29, 2020, Wendel SE sold its remaining ownership interest in Allied Universal to the new
investment group led by Warburg Pincus LLC and an affiliate of the J. Safra Group.

On July 15, 2020, we issued an additional $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes under
the Secured Indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the Trustee and as the Notes Collateral Agent.
The additional Secured Notes were issued in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. Holders of the additional Secured Notes are not entitled to any registration rights. The proceeds
from the additional Secured Notes were used to provide working capital and funds for other general corporate purposes
of the Company.

On July 17, 2020, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Phoenix Systems & Service, Inc. (PSSI) for
an initial purchase price subject to certain post-closing adjustments of $13.9 million. PSSI is a full-service security
systems integrator based in Chicago, Illinois, and provides security solutions to customers in Chicago and across the
United States.

On August 31, 2020, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Summit Security Services, Inc. (Summit)
for an initial purchase price subject to certain post-closing adjustments of $48.3 million. Summit is a security services
company that provides services to customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

On August 31, 2020, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Service Works Inc. (Service Works) for
an initial purchase price subject to certain post-closing adjustments of $7.2 million. Service Works is a full-service
security systems integrator based in Farmingdale, New Jersey and provides security solutions to customers in the
Northeast and throughout the United States.

On October 1, 2020, we acquired the assets of the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall
Airport (BWI) security operation of Akal Security, Inc. (“Akal”), including its contract with BWI, for $1.0 million.

On October 16, 2020, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Safe Environment Business Solutions,
Inc. (SEB) for an initial purchase price subject to certain post-closing adjustments of $31.8 million, including
contingent consideration of $9.8 million, which is subject to be paid based on achievement of certain targets after the


-----

acquisition date, and of which $5.0 million was paid in December 2020. Based in Ossining, New York, SEB provides
customized security solutions, including man-guarding, to customers throughout the United States.

On November 20, 2020, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Platt Security, Incorporated (“Platt”)
for an initial purchase price subject to certain post-closing adjustments of $3.7 million, including contingent
consideration of $1.1 million, which is subject to be paid based on achievement of certain targets after the acquisition
date. Platt is based in Long Beach, California and provides security services for public events, gated residential
communities, public housing developments, commercial buildings and shopping centers.

On December 27, 2020, The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”) was signed into law. The CAA
clarifies and expands the Paycheck Protection Program loans and the Employee Retention Credit as well as several
other tax provisions first outlined in the CARES Act. The CAA is currently being evaluated, however, we do not
anticipate a material impact as a result of this legislation.

**Characteristics of Allied Universal’s Revenues and Expenses**

**Revenues**

We generate revenues primarily from customer contracts obligating us to provide security officer services at
agreed-upon hourly billing rates. Our standard customer contract has a one-year term but may be terminated by either
our customer or us with 30 days’ advance notice. Many of our larger contracts are multi-year but also allow for
cancellation by either party with 30 to 90 days’ advance notice. We base our customer billings on the underlying
contractual terms, which generally include a mark-up on wages paid or a stated bill rate for hours worked. The majority
of our customers are billed a rate per hour worked which includes wages and benefits. We generally bill our customers
either in advance, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly.

Our revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2020 over the corresponding period was driven by
acquisitions, as well as organic revenue growth related to bill-rate improvements. Our organic revenue growth is
driven primarily by our ability to maintain strong customer retention rates and to attract new customers. Our contract
security officer revenues and high retention rates are dependent on our ability to attract and retain high-quality,
qualified employees. Our wage rates are generally above market averages, and we provide our security officers with
benefits at a higher level than many of our competitors. In addition, we engage in extensive candidate screening,
training and development, which supports employee retention. We believe our employee retention rate compares
favorably to the average retention rates in our industry. In turn, this has allowed us to realize higher than average
customer bill rates.

In addition to our security officer services, we provide security system, janitorial and other ancillary services
for our customers. Our security systems solutions include consulting, design and engineering, installation, and event
and repair services for security systems. These revenue streams represented approximately 6% of our total revenue
during the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Direct Expenses**

Direct expenses are comprised primarily of direct labor, payroll taxes, medical and life insurance benefits,
workers’ compensation costs, general liability, employment practices liability and automobile insurance costs, and
subcontract labor and other direct expenses. We classify all of our security officer wages and our account manager
compensation and payroll-related expenses as direct expenses. Compensation paid includes regular pay, overtime pay
for hourly personnel, bonus, vacation, training, holiday and sick time. The total hours paid normally exceeds total
hours billed principally due to unbillable overtime and certain other unbillable costs. We believe that we have higher
wage and benefit costs than other companies in our industry, due to our focus on attracting, developing and retaining
a highly qualified workforce.


-----

General wage inflation, payroll tax rate and related taxable wage threshold changes, and insurance premiums
and related claim costs are the primary drivers that affect the major components of direct expenses. Traditionally, we
have been able to pass increased costs in these areas on to our customers.

Our payroll tax expenses historically are higher in the first half of the year because a significant number of
employees do not reach their taxable wage limits for employer related federal and state unemployment taxes until the
second half of the year.

Medical benefit costs for the majority of our workforce consist of premium-based insurance costs.
Conversely, for administrative employees and security officers not subject to premium-based coverage, we are selfinsured and subject to self-insured retention limits. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for further
discussion.

**Key Factors Affecting Allied Universal’s Performance**

We believe the following trends and factors have an important impact on our financial performance:

  - Continued growth in the security market: Due to increased occurrences of adverse safety and security events
affecting the general public, continued wage growth, and increased outsourced services penetration, we
continue to see growth in the total size of the security market in the United States and globally. As a marketleading provider of security services and technology solutions, overall industry growth is a factor driving our
business. As such, our financial results are significantly affected by overall industry growth.

  - Increasing pressure on customer pricing combined with a competitive labor market: The security market is
intensely competitive as there are relatively low barriers to entry. We compete directly with companies that
are local, regional, national and international in scope. As more customers select service providers through
competitive bid processes intended to procure quality services at lower prices, our customer retention may
be affected as new market competitors may be willing to provide services at lower prices and margins. In
addition, we face pressure to increase compensation and benefits for employees as we compete with other
companies for the same workforce. Our ability to retain customers is dependent on our ability to hire, train
and retain employees at scale while efficiently deploying our workforce to efficiently meet our customers’
security service needs.

  - Our ability to deliver comprehensive, integrated security solutions and expand the use of technology:
Increasingly, our clients are asking us for more complex technology solutions and security operations
services. As such, we believe that our success will be based on our ability to tailor specific, innovative
solutions to meet the changing needs of our clients.

  - Our sales performance and ability to execute on strategy: The number of clients that we add in a given period
impacts our longer-term revenue. We are focused on attracting new clients, and expanding our service
offerings at existing clients. Furthermore, our ability to continue to pass along rate increases to our customers
will protect our margins but in part, could be offset by reduced hours.

  - Our continued ability to acquire and integrate accretive targets: Since 2007, and as of December 31, 2020,
we have acquired 73 businesses. Our acquisition process allows us to integrate targets, while minimizing
client disruption. Furthermore, we view expansion into international and adjacent markets to be an
opportunity driving future growth.

Revenues ................................................................ $ 8,501,054 $ 7,461,055 $ 1,039,999 13.9%

Revenues increased by $1,040.0 million, or 13.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to
the year ended December 31, 2019. Of this increase, $469.3 million relates to incremental revenue generated from
SOS, which was acquired on December 31, 2019. The remaining $570.7 million increase in revenues is primarily
attributable to other completed acquisitions and an increase in our average security officer billing rate, in part due to
premium services performed beginning at the end of March and through December 31, 2020. These premium services
peaked during the second and third quarters of 2020 and diminished during the fourth quarter of 2020.

**($ in thousands)**
Direct expenses .............................................................. $ 7,356,020 $ 6,588,222 $ 767,798 11.7%

Direct expenses increased by $767.8 million, or 11.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in direct expenses is primarily due to the increase in revenues of


-----

13.9%, partially offset by reduced insurance and overtime costs, as well as improved employee retention which results
in a reduction of training and recruiting costs, reduced payroll taxes and less unbillable overtime.

Direct expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 86.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from
88.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in direct expenses as a percentage of revenues is the
result of COVID-19 related premium services and the redeployment of displaced workers to reduce overtime expenses
beginning toward the end of March and through December 31, 2020, as well as longer-term operational improvements
made in our business during the year ended December 31, 2020, such as increases in bill-rates and the successful
implementation of workforce management initiatives resulting in lower non-billable overtime. While we are seeing a
return of hours to pre-COVID levels, we are also seeing a reduction of premium services, particularly during the fourth
quarter of 2020. It is uncertain how long the current situation will continue in this evolving environment.

2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to additional general and
administrative expenses from acquisitions, as well as higher amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by
realized acquisition synergies and reduced travel expenses.


Acquisition and related costs decreased by $79.3 million, or (75.3)%, for the year ended December 31, 2020
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower professional
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Acquisition and
related costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to the CDPQ Transaction.

Non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased by $22.3 million, or 384.1%, for the year ended
December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily attributable to the
issuance of Topco New Incentive Units to certain management-level employees in December 2019 in conjunction
with the CDPQ Transaction.

Loss on disposal of property and equipment decreased by $2.6 million, or (37.7)%, for the year ended
December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to a decrease in disposal activity during
the year ended December 31, 2020.

In connection with the Refinancing on July 12, 2019, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt
of $88.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, which includes the write-off of existing deferred financing
fees that had a carrying value of $62.4 million, $17.7 million of un-accreted original issue discount and $8.2 million
of fees paid to noteholders in connection with the notes redemption.

Interest expense, net, increased by $12.2 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest expense, net is primarily related to the issuance of
$540.0 million and $400.0 million of Existing 2026 Secured Notes on February 3, 2020 and July 15, 2020,
respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $10.2 million related to lower amortization of deferred financing fees
and lower interest rates resulting from the July 12, 2019 refinancing.

Income tax expense increased by $23.6 million, or 656.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as
compared to a benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in tax expense is primarily the result of an
increase in taxable income and a decrease in tax credits. The increase in taxable income in 2020 was due, in part, to
the deferral of the payment of the employer share of social security taxes for the period beginning March 27, 2020
through December 31, 2020.


**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the
financial statements requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates,
judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe
the following critical policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements.

**Business Combinations**

The cost of an acquired business is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and liabilities
assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed requires us to make estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily
available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and obligations
assumed is allocated to goodwill. Goodwill typically represents the value paid for the assembled workforce and
enhancement of our service offerings.

As part of certain completed acquisitions, we may agree to pay cash to the sellers based upon achievement
of certain targets after the acquisition date. The fair values of these contingent consideration arrangements are
estimated using a probability weighted income approach. We evaluate the fair value of the contingent consideration
throughout the year and every reporting period. Changes in the fair value during the measurement period that pertain


-----

to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are recorded as measurement period adjustments to
goodwill. Changes in the fair value resulting from events that occurred after the acquisition date are recorded as a gain
or loss on changes in fair value of the contingent purchase consideration in the consolidated statements of operations.

**Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Reserve**

We offer our products and services to public and private sector customers. The financial condition of our
customers is affected by changes in general economic conditions as well as by other economic pressures in the markets
in which our customers operate. We believe that the credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable is
mitigated by the fact that our customer base is diverse and geographically dispersed within North America. We do not
require collateral for trade receivables; however, we monitor our customer relationships in order to minimize our credit
risk.

We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for
doubtful accounts based on a culmination of factors. These factors include: (1) customer creditworthiness, (2) aging
of accounts receivable, (3) past transaction history with the customer, (4) current economic industry trends and
(5) changes in customer payment terms. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, adversely
affecting their ability to make payments, we would provide additional allowances. Changes in these factors, among
others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the allowance requires
judgment as to the impact of those and other factors on the ultimate realization of trade accounts receivable. We writeoff trade accounts receivable to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine collection is unlikely and we
have ceased our collection efforts.

**Long-lived Asset Impairment**

Long-lived assets include identifiable intangibles with finite lives (such as customer relationships) and
property and equipment. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Such events and circumstances include,
among other factors:

  - current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or forecasts
indicating continuing losses associated with the use of an asset,

  - significant decreases in the market value of an asset,

  - technological developments resulting in obsolescence,

  - significant changes in demand for our services in competition and competitive practices, or

  - significant negative changes in the business climate, industry or economic conditions.

Recoverability of our long-lived assets is determined based upon the expected undiscounted future net cash
flows from the operations to which the assets relate, utilizing our best estimates, appropriate assumptions, and
projections at the time of review. If the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash
flows, the asset is deemed impaired, and an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value
exceeded the estimated fair market value of the asset.

**Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment**

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment
annually as of October 1. For goodwill, which we have determined is a single reporting unit, we may conduct an
assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit
is less than its carrying amount. In a qualitative assessment, we would consider the macroeconomic conditions,
including any deterioration of general conditions and industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in
the environment where the reporting unit operates, increased competition, changes in the products/services and
regulatory and political developments, cost of doing business, overall financial performance, including any declining
cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods, other relevant reporting unit
specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation, and events affecting the reporting
unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair


-----

value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we would perform the quantitative goodwill impairment
test as required. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
the carrying value, then no further testing is required. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then we would
record an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the
reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on a combination of significant observable and
unobservable inputs, including estimates of future operating performance. Changes in market conditions, among other
factors, may have an impact on these estimates.

For our indefinite-lived trade names, we may also conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine
whether or not it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value. If we determine
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the trade names is less than their carrying value, we estimate the
fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names using the relief from royalty method. The relief from royalty method
measures the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such intangible assets and not having to pay a royalty
for their use. Impairment would then be recognized for the difference between the determined fair value and their
carrying value, if applicable.

**Insurance Reserves**

We maintain insurance coverage, subject to certain self-insured retention limits, for workers’ compensation,
general liability, employment practices liability, automobile liability and healthcare claims. Medical benefit costs for
the majority of our workforce are premium-based. Costs associated with the premium-based plans equal the actual
premiums paid and premiums can fluctuate. Conversely, for administrative employees and security officers not subject
to premium-based coverage, we are self-insured and subject to self-insured retention limits.

We record a reserve if we believe it is probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably
estimate the amount of the loss. We provide a reserve for all known claims and those claims that we believe have been
incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date based on our estimate of the ultimate cost of the claims. Our
estimates of the ultimate cost of claims are derived from the level of our insurance coverages, our retained risk of loss,
third-party actuarial analyses and management’s judgment. We review these estimates on a quarterly basis subject to
information then currently available to assess their adequacy and the propriety of disclosure. We adjust the reserves,
if needed, based on the results of our review. Assessing the adequacy of these reserves is highly subjective and requires
judgments about future events. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates.

In the normal course of operations, various legal claims are filed against the Company for which we maintain
insurance coverage. We have reserved for these claims based on insurance coverage, the risk of loss retained by the
Company and management’s judgment. We do not expect the ultimate outcome of any of these actions to have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

**Equity Unit-Based Compensation Plans**

Equity unit-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the equity
award using an appropriate option-pricing method and are recognized in the statements of operations over the period
during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. This expense is presented as a
separate line item under operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

We use an independent valuation advisor to assist with determining the fair value of the equity awards used
for calculating equity unit-based compensation. We consider both the historical volatility of our peer group’s stock
prices, as well as implied volatilities from exchange-traded options on our peer group’s equity units, as applicable.
The expected term used represents the period that the equity units are expected to be outstanding and is determined
using the simplified method. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity unit-based awards represent
management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s
judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions were used, equity unit-based compensation could
materially differ in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate as well as
achievement of any performance metric specified within the award, and only recognize expense for those units
expected to vest. If the actual forfeiture rate or expected achievement of the performance metric is materially different


-----

from its estimate, the equity unit-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have
recorded in the current period.

**Income Taxes**

Within our financial reporting structure there are legal entities treated as partnerships and C-corporations that
are both consolidated and treated separately for federal and state income tax reporting purposes. The legal entities that
are treated as partnerships for federal and state income tax purposes pass their taxable income or loss through to the
members who report their share of the income or loss which has been allocated to them under the respective
membership agreements. The membership agreements have provisions requiring the distribution of funds to the
members in amounts sufficient for the members to satisfy their federal, state, and local tax obligations with respect to
their share of our income, subject to board approval.

The legal entities that are treated as C-corporations calculate an income tax provision or benefit for the current
income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of differences between the accounting and tax
treatment of items related to these entities. Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than
not that some amount of a recorded deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the
amount sufficient to reduce that deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

We file U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax returns. Tax returns for years beginning in 2017 are subject to
audit by the Internal Revenue Service and various tax authorities. While we have accrued for amounts we believe are
in accordance with the accounting standard, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is
more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we may later decide to challenge
any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed annually with
guidance provided in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return that directly or indirectly affect amounts reported in financial statements. ASC Topic 740
also provides accounting guidance for the related income tax effects of individual tax positions that do not meet the
recognition thresholds required in order for any part of the benefit of that tax position to be recognized in an entity’s
financial statements.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

As of December 31, 2020, we had $970.9 million in cash and $1,640.7 million in working capital. Our
liquidity requirements are principally for debt service, working capital and potential acquisitions. Our primary source
of liquidity is cash provided by operating and financing activities. We also had $300.0 million and $607.1 million
available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility and ABL Credit Facility, respectively, as of December
31, 2020, that provide additional liquidity to the Company as needed.

**Credit Agreements**

On July 12, 2019, we refinanced our debt and entered into certain senior secured credit facilities (the
“Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities”), which consist of (i) a $2,020.0 million seven year senior secured term
loan facility (the “Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility”) and a delayed draw term loan facility providing borrowings
of up to $200.0 million (the “Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility”), (ii) a $300.0 million five year senior
secured revolving credit facility (the “Existing Revolving Credit Facility”) and (iii) a $750.0 million five year asset
based lending credit facility. The Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility was fully drawn on July 12, 2019.
Contemporaneously with the entry into the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we issued (i) $1,000.0 million
aggregate principal amount of Existing 2026 Secured Notes under an indenture dated July 12, 2019 (the “Existing
Secured Indenture”) and (ii) $1,050.0 million aggregate principal amount of Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes under an
indenture dated July 12, 2019 (the “Existing Unsecured Indenture”) with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) and as notes collateral agent (the “Notes Collateral Agent”). The Existing 2026 Secured Notes
and Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes were issued in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. Holders of the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes
are not entitled to any registration rights and the Secured Indenture and Unsecured Indenture are not qualified under
the Trust Indenture Act.


-----

The proceeds from the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and
Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes were used to (i) repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the then existing 2015
facility, (ii) redeem in full all borrowings under the then existing second lien note purchase agreement, (iii) pay related
fees, costs, premiums and expenses in connection with these transactions (such transactions, the “Refinancing”), (iv)
cash collateralize, replace or provide credit support for certain existing letters of credit outstanding and (v) provide
working capital and funds for our other general corporate purposes (and certain fees and expenses related thereto).
The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility was fully drawn on December 30, 2019 in connection with the acquisition of
SOS.

In connection with the Refinancing, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $88.3 million,
which includes the write-off of existing deferred financing fees that had a carrying value of $62.4 million, $17.7
million of un-accreted original issue discount and $8.2 million of fees paid to noteholders in connection with the notes
redemption. In connection with the Refinancing, we also capitalized an additional $88.5 million of financing fees,
including $59.0 million of original issue discount.

On February 3, 2020, we issued an additional $540.0 million aggregate principal amount of Existing 2026
Secured Notes under the Existing Secured Indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the Trustee and
as the Notes Collateral Agent. The additional Existing 2026 Secured Notes were issued in a private transaction that
was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Holders of the additional Existing 2026 Secured
Notes are not entitled to any registration rights. In connection with the issuance, we capitalized $25.7 million of
original issue premium. The proceeds from the additional Existing 2026 Secured Notes were used to repay the
outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility and provide working capital and funds for other general
corporate purposes of the Company.

During March 2020, we borrowed $500.0 million under the ABL Credit Facility out of an abundance of
caution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. After not using any of the additional cash provided by this borrowing,
we repaid the $500.0 million in full during August 2020.

On July 15, 2020, we issued an additional $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Existing 2026
Secured Notes under the Existing Secured Indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the Trustee and
as the Notes Collateral Agent. The additional Existing 2026 Secured Notes were issued in a private transaction that
was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Holders of the additional Existing 2026 Secured
Notes are not entitled to any registration rights. In connection with the issuance, we capitalized $12.0 million of
original issue premium. The proceeds from the additional Existing 2026 Secured Notes were used to provide working
capital and funds for other general corporate purposes of the Company.

Outstanding balances under the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility, Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan
Facility and Existing Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest equal to, at our option: (a) LIBOR plus 4.25% or (b) at
the bank’s prime rate plus between 2.75% and 3.25% based on a first lien leverage calculation. Amounts drawn on
the ABL Credit Facility accrue interest equal to, at our option: (a) LIBOR plus between 1.25% and 1.75% or (b) at
the bank’s prime rate, plus between 0.25% and 0.75%. We incur a fixed 4.25% fee on all outstanding issued letters of
credit (“LoCs”) pledged against the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and incur a 1.25% or 1.50% fee on all
outstanding issued LoCs pledged against the ABL Credit Facility. In addition, we incur a fixed 0.125% issuer fee on
all outstanding LoCs pledged against the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and ABL Credit Facility.

Outstanding balances under the Existing 2026 Secured Notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 6.625%.
Outstanding balances under the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 9.750%.

Principal on the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility and Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility is
payable in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original aggregate principal amounts, with the remaining
unpaid balances due on July 12, 2026, the maturity date. All unpaid balances of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
and ABL Credit Facility are due and payable on July 12, 2024, the maturity dates. All unpaid balances of the Existing
2026 Secured Notes are due and payable on July 15, 2026, the maturity date. All unpaid balances of the Existing 2027
Unsecured Notes are due and payable on July 15, 2027, the maturity date. The Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility
and Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility also contain provisions for potential additional principal payments
based on excess cash flow for years commencing with the year ended December 31, 2020. We determined that an


-----

additional principal payment based on excess cash flow was not required for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Voluntary prepayments of amounts outstanding under the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility, the Existing Delayed
Draw Term Loan Facility, the Existing Secured Indenture and the Existing Unsecured Indenture are permitted under
certain circumstances.

Borrowings under the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility, the Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility,
and the Existing Secured Indenture are secured by substantially all of our assets. The Existing First Lien Term Loan
Facility, the Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the Existing Secured Indenture and Existing Unsecured
Indenture contain customary restrictive covenants, which include maintaining a defined leverage ratio and restrictions
on distributions to members.

Under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we may issue up to $100.0 million in LoCs against the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility and another $400.0 million against the ABL Credit Facility. Availability under
both the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and ABL Credit Facility is reduced by outstanding revolver-funded LoCs,
which serve primarily as collateral for our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance policies. As of
December 31, 2020, the total amount of LoCs pledged against the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and ABL Credit
Facility was $0 and $142.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the total amount of LoCs pledged against
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and ABL Credit Facility was $1.0 million and $115.9 million, respectively.

The amount available for borrowing under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and ABL Credit Facility at
December 31, 2020 was $300.0 million and $607.1 million, respectively. The amount available for borrowing under
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and ABL Credit Facility at December 31, 2019 was $299.0 million and $229.1
million, respectively.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, $8.0 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of unamortized deferred
financing fees was included in deposits and other long-term assets and $20.8 million and $21.2 million, respectively,
of unamortized deferred financing fees was presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related
debt liability and included in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.

SOS, received a $10.0 million refund from escrow related to a USSA acquisition working capital adjustment and
received a $1.7 million refund from escrow related to the settlement of certain Covenant acquisition earn out
provisions.

**Financing Activities**

Financing activities have consisted primarily of borrowings and repayments on long-term debt associated
with acquisitions of businesses. Cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019 was $451.1 million and $759.7 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received

2019, we refinanced our debt on July 12, 2019 and received proceeds from a new first lien term loan of $2,020.0
million, new senior secured notes of $1,000.0 million and new senior unsecured notes of $1,050.0 million, repaid in
full the then existing first lien term loan of $2,981.4 million, second lien term loan of $245.0 million and second lien
notes of $710.0 million and paid $88.5 million of financing fees. Additionally, during the year ended December 31,
2019, we received proceeds from a new delayed draw term loan of $200.0 million, had net borrowings on our ABL
Credit Facility of $405.0 million and net repayments of our revolving credit loan of $29.0 million, received equity
contributions including $208.0 million due to the investment in Allied Universal by CDPQ, made capital lease and
other financing payments of $47.0 million, made principal payments on our then existing term loan facilities of
$15.3 million and made distributions to members of $3.6 million.

Based upon our current level of operations, we believe that our existing cash balances and our cash from
operating activities, together with available borrowings under our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, will be
adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, income tax payments and
distributions, commitments and interest payments for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that
our business will continue to generate cash flow at our current level of operations or that anticipated improvements in
our current level of operations will be achieved. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to
service our debt, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our
indebtedness or obtain additional financing. Our ability to make scheduled principal payments or to pay interest on or
to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are
subject to general conditions in or affecting our industry and to general conditions and factors that are beyond our
control. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness or
to make capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2020, we do not have any material commitments related to capital
expenditures.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement**

We are not currently a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements.

**Inflation**

In general, our costs are affected by inflation and we may experience the effects of inflation in future periods.
Management believes, however, that such effects have not been material to us during the past two years.

**Related Party Transactions**

We are party to an Investor Management Agreement with certain funds and vehicles affiliated with Warburg
Pincus LLC pursuant to which we receive certain administrative and management services. In exchange for these
services, we incurred fees from our sponsors for services rendered for strategic planning, management control matters,
external financing and other services of $6.8 million and $5.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019, respectively. Additionally, $1.7 million and $1.4 million in director fees were paid in 2020 and 2019,
respectively.

In addition, pursuant to our membership agreements, we pay distributions to our members or in some
instances we make our tax payments directly to the respective taxing authorities on our members’ behalf, with respect
to income tax that they owe on earnings that are allocated to them. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019, distributions aggregating $12.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively, were made to certain unit holders.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

**Interest rates**

We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. Interest rates on the Existing Senior
Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates and therefore actual interest rates could be significantly different
than the assumed rates.

**BUSINESS**

**Our Company**

**Business Overview**

Allied Universal is North America’s leading security and facility services provider. With over 250,000
security professionals and offices located throughout the United States as well as internationally (Canada, Mexico,
and the United Kingdom), Allied Universal serves approximately 14,800 clients and is responsible for protecting more
than 50,000 client sites covering multiple specialty sectors such as higher education, healthcare, retail, commercial
real estate, government, and corporate campuses, including a significant portion of the Fortune 500 companies. Allied
Universal’s services span manned guarding, innovative technology systems, risk and consulting, janitorial and staffing
services, integration services, and digital solutions and remote monitoring.

We are responsible for providing “best-in-class” security services that allow clients to completely outsource
the recruiting, screening, hiring, training, uniforming, scheduling and supervision of security officers. Our security
officers work on-location at customer sites and are responsible for observing, detecting, deterring and reporting and
responding to perceived, potential or actual security threats. We also provide specialized security services such as
vehicle patrol, visitor management, K-9 security services, top security facility cleared security professionals, and joint
security programs. We have an operational presence in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and
have a growing presence in Canada, Latin America, and the United Kingdom.

In addition to providing manned guarding services, we provide comprehensive technology solutions to our
customers, including video surveillance, CCTV picture capture and monitoring, robot patrolling, GPS-based patrol
and reporting, management of access control points and centralized security operations. We also offer systems
integration services to design, install and service fully integrated technology-based monitoring systems, along with
digital solutions and remote monitoring through our MaRC. We are able to leverage our large manned guarding
customer base and service platform to cross-sell these additional system integration services. Finally, we offer a range
of ancillary services, including temporary and permanent staffing, event staffing and security, janitorial services, and
consulting and investigation solutions.

Allied Universal was formed in August 2016 through the combination of AlliedBarton and Universal, which
brought together two of the leading providers in the security services industry. AlliedBarton, founded in 1957, and
Universal, founded in 1965, were leaders in the industry in customer service, organic growth, customer and employee
retention, accretive M&A, and had a highly complementary and diverse set of blue chip customers. The combined
company became the largest provider of security officer services in North America and has continued to grow since,
both organically and through M&A. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Allied Universal acquired U.S. Security Associates
Holdings, Inc., a leading North American provider of security solutions, including manned security, consulting,
investigations, and disaster and emergency response services. Since 2007, the company has successfully executed 72
acquisitions, including small and large tuck-ins. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Allied announced the acquisition of
SOS Security which brought a complementary approach and further scale to Allied Universal. As of 2020, Allied
Universal has an estimated 31% share of the highly fragmented outsourced manned guarding security services market
in the United States, with a track record of growth driven both organically and through acquisitions.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we had
Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenues of $18,357.1 million and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA of
$1,955.9 million, respectively. See “—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Combined Financial
Information” for a reconciliation of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenues and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA to revenues and net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP and/or IFRS measures.

**G4S Acquisition**

On December 8, 2020, the governing boards of Allied Universal and of G4S announced that they had reached
agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer, to be made by Allied Bidco, a newly incorporated entity that is
indirectly controlled by Allied Universal, to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of G4S, with G4S’


-----

directors recommending Allied Universal’s offer of 245 pence per share, representing a purchase price of
approximately £3.8 billion and total enterprise value of approximately £5.4 billion (the G4S Offer). On March 16,
2021, we announced the offer becoming unconditional as to acceptances, having received valid acceptances
representing approximately 79% of total G4S shares. On April 6, 2021, the G4S Offer became wholly unconditional,
and we completed the G4S Acquisition.

**G4S Overview**

G4S is a leading global security company, specializing in the provision of security services and solutions to
customers around the world. G4S’s roots can be traced back approximately 120 years ago to 1901, when the guarding
company Kjøbenhavn Frederiksberg Nattevagt was established in Denmark. Since then, G4S has expanded both
organically and through acquisitions, culminating in the merger of Securicor and Group 4 Falck to create G4S in 2004.
G4S is active in 90 countries across the globe, has more than 490,000 security professionals, and purchases goods and
services from approximately 40,000 suppliers. G4S has security integration capabilities in more than 40 key markets
and more than 13,000 monitored end points with key markets across the Americas, Africa, Asia and EMEA. Key
services include system design, integration & maintenance, manned & mobile guarding, monitoring & response,
consultancy & risk management, analytics, equipment and software. G4S provides its services to a broad range of
customers across various types of sites, including Fortune 500 companies, construction sites and manufacturing
facilities, hospital campuses and healthcare facilities, oil, gas, energy and other regulated facilities, financial
institutions and banking centers, college and university campuses, courthouses and government buildings, law
enforcement support including detainee processing and transport, and gated and residential communities.

The G4S business model starts with anticipating customer needs through detailed risk assessments. G4S is
investing in the resources, skills and capabilities needed to market, design, build, operate and maintain technologyenabled Integrated Security solutions. Through its Secure Solutions segment, G4S is a global market leader in security,
providing both traditional manned-guarding and technology-enabled security solutions in addition to consultancy
services and analytics to its customers. G4S uses its expertise, service delivery and integration alongside its geographic
scale to differentiate the business to customers, drive outsourcing and enhance the value of traditional security services
through greater use of technology. G4S officers are tailored for the specific need of each client, including the
following: custom protection officers who meet stringent experience and training requirements and are prepared to
step into high profile locations; upscale security officers who perform security patrols of designated areas on foot or
in a vehicle; lobby ambassadors who present a professional and courteous appearance while also possessing customer
service skills and focus and bank protection officers who provide visible deterrence of criminal activity at entrances
of financial institutions and banking centers. Currently, technology-enabled security services represent approximately
45% of Secure Solutions revenue. G4S is focused on pivoting from manned guarding to “predictive” security services
with consulting, technology, people and data analytics to continue margin expansion going forward.

G4S’s Cash Solutions segment is comprised of the Retail Technology Solutions and Conventional Cash
divisions. On February 26, 2020, G4S announced it agreed to sell the majority of its Conventional Cash businesses to
Brink’s for cash consideration of £666 million, allowing it to focus on the growth of its core integrated security
solutions business and further develop the rapidly growing Retail Technology Solutions business. Retail Technology
Solutions provides unique, value-add cash management solutions to clients and goes to market through the brands
Retail Cash Solutions, CASH360, Desposita, G4SPay, and South Africa-Deposits. G4S technologies offer a breadth
of solutions to clients including automated cash management and reconciliation and unique forecasting tools for retail
cash operations. Conventional Cash services include armored cash transportation, typically facilitated between cash
centers and customer outlets, as well as counterfeit detection, cash redistribution to banks and ATMs, ATM
management, including cash forecasting, replenishment, reconciliation and maintenance, counting and secure
international transportation of cash and valuables including, but not limited to, currency, gems and precious metals.

G4S’s Consulting Services segment helps clients manage and react to risks, such as risks associated with
crime, terrorism and entering into new markets, by providing remote site services and facilities management capability
in low infrastructure, conflict afflicted and hostile environments. Such services include security, aviation security,
facilities management, life support, remote logistics and fleet management, and training and capacity building
services. Additionally, the G4S Ordnance Management teams help clear explosives and other forms of ordnance from
sites that were once occupied by ISIS.


-----

G4S’s Care & Justice Services segment, which is concentrated in the United Kingdom and Australia, provides
custody and detention, rehabilitation, education, employment, electronic monitoring, immigration and borders, police
back office support, secure healthcare and non-urgent patient transport services to central and local governments and
their agencies, regulatory bodies, UK police forces and the private sector. The Care & Justice Services segment also
provides critical primary and forensic healthcare services for the public and private sectors and provides healthcare
services within police custody suites and other secure environments, caring for detainee health needs and supporting
the collection of forensic samples.

Further, as a responsible employer, G4S’s priorities embrace sustainable investment to promote the health
and safety of employees, as reflected in the improvement in G4S’s health and safety performance over the past seven
years. For example, during 2020, 15 G4S employees lost their lives in the course of carrying out their duties, as
compared with 20 fatalities in 2019, which was significantly lower than levels experienced in earlier years, reflecting
the benefits of G4S’s health and safety programs. G4S continues to reduce its employee injury rate, and lost time
injury rates also improved, falling from 5.7 per 1,000 employees in 2019 to 4.6 in 2020. In addition, during 2020, G4S
launched a mental health awareness campaign entitled Ready to Work, recognizing that communities have been under
additional stress during the year with the impact of COVID-19, which program will continue into 2021.

In terms of risk mitigation, G4S believes that behaving with integrity and respect is key to G4S’ core values,
forming an integral part of the G4S’s strategy and an essential foundation on which G4S carries out its business. To
that end, in 2020, G4S reviewed and relaunched a number of its ethics and social responsibility policies. G4S’s new
Ethics Code sets out the ethical standards which apply to all G4S businesses and employees. This was launched early
in 2021, supported by an extensive communications, training and engagement program. In addition, G4S has also
updated its whistleblowing policy, anti-bribery & corruption framework and its human rights policy and
accompanying guidance. G4S has also refreshed its training program on ABC. To ensure the training is effective and
reaches those who need it, in addition to all new employees, all managers and staff with responsibility for making any
financial decisions and for controlling assets have been prioritized to undertake the new ABC training and to repeat it
annually.

Given the significant re-shaping of G4S’s business portfolio in recent years, we believe that the G4S is now
positioned to develop an enhanced service mix with a growing proportion of higher value Integrated Security services.
The combined benefits of the G4S strategy, strong execution, emphasis on employee health and safety, continued
focus on risk mitigation and rapid response to COVID-19 are reflected in G4S’s underlying results for the year ended
December 31, 2020. Please see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information of G4S” and
the audited financial statements of G4S and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering circular.

**Strategic Rationale**

**Enhances the combined company’s geographic coverage and capabilities to serve customers, especially in the**
**core North America market, which represents approximately 70% of pro forma combined revenues**

We believe the G4S acquisition is a strategically and financially compelling transaction that will expand our
geographic footprint, enhance our scale, diversify our products and services offering, increase market position and
provide new growth channels in untapped regions and end-markets. The acquisition of G4S provides Allied Universal
with a unique opportunity to acquire a well-established integrated security services company with a globally
recognized security services brand, and platform to increase the combined company’s top line sales and profitability.
Allied Universal and G4S are two of the top five global companies in the highly fragmented security services industry
based on revenue. Together, we will be a global leading company in the security services.

The transaction enhances the combined company’s geographic coverage and capabilities to serve customers,
especially in the core North America market, which represents approximately 70% of pro forma combined revenues.
Allied Universal has a strong footprint in North America with a presence in all 50 states, and the merger with G4S
creates unparalleled scale and increases density, with footprint overlap allowing the combined company to take a bestof approach to servicing clients in the various regions. Based on revenue generation, we rank number one in Manned
Guarding and Retail Technology solutions and number three in Security Technology in North America. We provide
a comprehensive, diverse product offering with value-added services and world-class quality to our end-customers.
We believe our increased scale in multiple regions and the breadth of our services will make our services more


-----

attractive to our customers. Both Allied Universal and G4S provide diversified solutions in addition to traditional
manned guarding services. The Allied Universal and G4S transaction creates a fully integrated security business with
the ability to address customers’ evolving security needs in an increasingly evolving and fast-changing world with
increased demand.

**Increases diversification across end-markets, customers and geographies**

While Allied Universal has historically focused more on the North American region, the acquisition of G4S
enables Allied Universal to significantly increase its global footprint and diversify its base to operating in over 90
countries. The combination with G4S establishes Allied Universal as a global security services leader with unmatched
scale and expertise in providing quality security services across a range of geographies. The combination of Allied
Universal’s and G4S’s solutions and significant manned-guarding businesses will create a global one-stop-shop for
customers and a business ideally positioned to lead the industry shift from traditional security officer and patrol
services towards services that integrate technology solutions with manned security services. See “—Industry
Overview—Security Services Technology.” Allied Universal’s decades of experience in risk advisory and consulting,
investigations, executive protection and emergency response will complement G4S’s corporate risk services to provide
end-to-end security solutions. With appropriate support, capital and assistance from Allied Universal, G4S would be
able to concentrate on addressing the ongoing industry shift towards electronic and technology-based services.

**Strengthens platform with blue chip customer base**

The combination of Allied Universal and G4S will create a world-leading integrated security business
providing services to an extensive portfolio of blue-chip clients across the public and private sectors. We sell to a
diversified customer base and end-markets in various verticals, including commercial real estate, retail and malls,
government, healthcare, tech and media, manufacturing and industrial, financial institution, chemical and
petrochemical, and aerospace and defense. We are the trusted provider to premium accounts for clients with greater
than $5 million annual revenue across multiple regions and a central point of contact for purchasing security services.
Our leading global scale helps promote trust and confidence among our sophisticated customers and serves as a
significant differentiator versus regional competitors. The combination expands Allied Universal’s base of long
tenured blue chip customers globally and uniquely positions the combined company to serve customers seeking
integrated security solutions providers of scale. Allied Universal has had annual revenue retention of over 90% for the
past 5 years and has minimal customer concentration with top five customers representing less than 5% of revenues.
Doing business and negotiating long-term contracts through a centralized procurement division drives strong valueadded partnerships underpinned by highly sticky relationships, which increase the switching costs for our customers.

**Acquisition adds density and expertise to North America technology business**

The combined group will increase Allied Universal’s reach and depth of services, enhancing our leadership
position and allowing us to expand internationally on current domestic accounts. While Allied Universal has an
established customer base with significant density in traditional manned-guarding services, G4S will contribute to our
operational scale in Retail Cash solutions and Retail Technology solutions, which have grown since launching in 2015.
We see this as a new services platform, especially in our security technology services that we can cross-sell with North
American customers and improve Allied Universal’s services coverage. The expansion of Allied Universal’s
technology services platform capabilities will enable the combined company to offer superior client service, with
greater breadth, accountability, improved efficiency and cost savings. We have competitive advantages through strong
trajectory relative to competitors and potential disruptors and we transfer our knowledge and experience in the United
States to deploy our abilities to compete in adjacent markets.

**Meaningful cost synergy opportunity**

We intend to deploy operational and strategic best practices across Allied Universal and G4S to drive
additional growth, enable cross-selling capabilities, enhance operational performance and increase free cash flow
conversion. We estimate that the combination will unlock approximately $155 million in targeted annual cost savings
once G4S is fully integrated and our cost savings initiatives have been fully implemented. Allied Universal has a
strong track record of successful acquisition integration, including synergy realization. We anticipate that our
disciplined management of fixed and variable operating expenses, revenue and financing synergies, as well as


-----

corporate overhead and headcount rationalization will primarily drive cost synergies. Historically, we have made a
significant number of acquisitions and we have well-developed systems and processes throughout our organization to
support integration efforts, resulting in more efficient synergy realization and helping drive overall margin
improvement.

The overlapping business functions in North America provide a significant opportunity for real estate and
personnel rationalization. Due to overlapping operations, we expect significant synergies in the following areas in the
North America region: general and administrative expenses, duplicative service contracts, insurance, and facilities
expense. Additionally, we will be able to eliminate any expenses in functional support areas that support G4S’s status
as a public listed company. Further, we believe opportunities exist to increase operating leverage through
diversification across investment in capabilities, such as additional training and technology deployments.

**Industry Overview**

**Market Overview**

The global contract security services market is large, has been stable and is expected to continue its consistent
growth supported by a number of favorable trends. The US security services market was estimated to generate
approximately $66 billion in revenue in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 4% to 5% CAGR from 2021 to 2025. The
US security services market for outsourced manned guarding generated over $28 billion in revenue in 2020 and grew
at a 4.3% CAGR from 2017 to 2020. The security technology market in the US is also large, with revenues estimated
to be approximately $17 billion in 2020, and grew slightly quicker than the manned guarding segment, at a CAGR of
approximately 8% from 2017 to 2020. The market was estimated to be comprised of approximately 42% manned
guarding and 25% security technology. Internationally, the security services market for manned guarding grew to $34
billion in revenue in 2020 and is expected to reach approximately $40 billion in revenue in 2025, representing an
estimated compound annual growth rate of 5% from 2021 to 2025.

A heightened focus on security, both in the United States and globally, has been driven by high profile gun
violence, domestic terrorism events, a rise in workplace incidents and both peaceful and violent protest events, which
have led to increased spending on security. Our service offerings represent an important first line of defense against
potential security threats. Meanwhile, mega trends occurring around the world and positive growth tailwinds in the
distribution, manufacturing, healthcare and education sectors also support demand for increasing security. In addition,
organizations continue to outsource their security services primarily to alleviate administrative burdens and achieve
cost savings, while the compelling value proposition delivered through scale, broad service offerings and robust
technological infrastructure drive them to shift to highly professionalized providers.

Given the high-risk exposure of inadequate security, we believe that customers make purchasing decisions
based on service quality, reliability, and reputation, rather than price alone. It has been our experience that customers
seek out and maintain long-term relationships with quality providers. For example, industry switching rates have
historically been between 10% to 15% on average annually, and customer retention rates are higher for large customers
served under national contracts, according to a third party consulting study. Meanwhile, Allied Universal, as a scale
provider, experienced below average annual customer switching rates of between 5% to 10%.

We believe the industry’s stability in various economic cycles is underpinned by the recession-resistant
nature of security services, resulting in limited cyclicality and customer churn. Over a ten-year period, industry growth
has been consistent, and historically recession-resistant, experiencing only one year of flat-to-slightly declining
growth. The impact of economic downturns on labor markets, which includes higher employee retention, and
subsequently lower unbilled overtime, recruiting and training costs, historically have led to EBITDA margin
expansion, which has historically been sustained during a return to economic expansion. Our experience during 2020
demonstrates the resiliency of our business model. Despite lockdowns and office closures during the COVID
pandemic, security services remained an essential part of real estate management and asset protection. During this
period, we also experienced a temporary shift in demand from security services in connection with retail, travel and
leisure to grocery and other essential businesses. We also experienced an increase in demand for higher value-add
services such as temperature screening. During the summer of 2020, protests and other civil events drove demand for
our manned guarding services, providing further diversification and resiliency against office closings.

US Outsourced Security Guard Industry

($ in billions)

**Market Drivers**

The US security services and security technology integration and manned guarding market is expected to
grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2021 through 2025. Several positive trends support this growth, including:
(i) baseline expansion from building stock growth, guard penetration in existing buildings, and wage rate growth
which is passed on through the mark-up model used to price security services; (ii) secular demand growth due to
heightened focus on security driven by increased acts of violence and media coverage, increasing regulatory and
insurance scrutiny; and (iii) increased outsourcing rate for security services. Furthermore, there is a trend toward the
centralization of security programs and integration of manned guarding with technology solutions, both of which favor
best-in-class national providers. As the national player with vertical markets expertise and differentiated integrated
security and technology solutions, we are well-positioned to benefit from favorable industry tailwinds.

Globally, demand for security services has also increased steadily and is expected to grow at a CAGR of
4.9% between 2020 and 2024. Demand is driven by similar factors as in the United States as well as elevated safety
and security risks and concerns driven by geopolitical events such as refuge crises, increased wealth driven by
urbanization, global GDP growth, rising labor costs supporting demand for higher-value, technology-enabled,
integrated security solutions and demand for higher-value service lines driven by more advanced technology
capabilities.

The COVID pandemic demonstrated the industry’s resilience as the global security services market continued
to experience growth despite lockdowns throughout much of the world.

**Base-Line Industry Growth**

Base-line industry growth is driven by underlying economic growth, growing wage rates and increasing
building stock, as each new building adds incremental demand for the security services industry. While building stock
growth provides strong underlying support for the security services market, it is not necessary to sustain growth within
our existing customer bases. A growing economy drives up overall wage rates, increases statutory minimum wages
and provides union increases, all which are typically passed on to customers through a stable mark-up. Increased wage
rates are expected to continue driving further expansion of the manned guarding market and increase revenue
generation from existing clients.

**Growing Demand for Security Services**

Security services remain critical and non-discretionary as customers overwhelmingly value the role of
security officers in deterring criminal activity and other incidents, all the while providing assurance against real or
perceived security threats. In cases of security incidents, customers value the officers’ ability to provide immediate
response. Technology can enhance and significantly improve security but we believe there is no substitute for the
physical presence of well-trained and dedicated security personnel who can respond to threats in real-time.


-----

The demand for security services continues to increase due to heightened security concerns stemming from
the ongoing threat of terrorism and high profile gun violence, large protest events, heightened importance of public
and workplace safety, refugee crises and the growing need to supplement services provided by the public sector.
Heightened media coverage of security lapses, growing costs of disruption, and stricter security requirements by
government institutions and private insurers have forced organizations to take greater responsibility for their own
security.

**Increased Outsourcing to Third-party Providers with National and Global Scale**

Currently, approximately 65% of manned security services in the United States are outsourced to professional
security services firms, and this outsourcing rate is expected to increase incrementally over time. The trend toward
outsourcing is expected to continue to drive growth in the industry due to the strong value proposition of contract
security service providers and non-core nature of security for the vast majority of companies.

Due to the growing complexity surrounding security-related issues and increased demand for vertical
segment expertise and customized guarding services, outsourcing security services to “best-in-class” providers
continues to be an attractive option for customers. Contract security services firms can offer customers improved
security, reduced non-core administrative burden, and competitive pricing through operating leverage, each of which
are compelling reasons supporting the trend toward outsourcing various business services. Outsourcing of non-core
functions has not only become a corporate best practice, but also a function of the public sector as governments look
to minimize cost. Outsourcing allows companies and governments to reduce labor costs and shift the administrative
burden of non-core functions to third-party vendors with more experience, operating leverage, and functional area
expertise.

As one of the few security and facility services providers with national and global scale, we believe the
combined Allied Universal and G4S business is well-positioned to benefit from the trend toward outsourcing security
services. For example, we are able to address customers’ increasingly complex security needs and their preference for
best-in-class providers with strong reputations and vertical markets expertise, rather than local providers. In addition,
as national customers increasingly seek to consolidate vendors, they build relationships with national partners that can
reliably and consistently serve them across multiple regions. Finally, the increased centralization of procurement
continues to drive the shift in customer decision-making from a local level to a multi-region and national level,
providing an opportunity for national providers to increase customer penetration.

**Security Services Technology**

Due to the importance of having security officers physically present to deter and quickly respond to incidents,
technology has been used primarily to enhance and better enable manned security services. Security services providers
such as Allied Universal and G4S continue to broaden their portfolio of services by combining value-added offerings
like access controls, ID verification, video monitoring, and communications systems with traditional security officer
and patrol services. Customers seek integration between manned guarding services and complementary technology
solutions in order to improve and reduce the complexity of their security operations. Existing customer relationships
create the ability to cross-sell services for the installation, integration and maintenance of physical technology systems
that augment manned guarding services. Integrated technology solutions enhance the value delivered to customers
and foster customer retention. They provide a recurring revenue model for providers, as they require one-time sales
and installations but involve regular system services and maintenance.

**Industry Consolidation**

Over the past eight years, the contract security services industry has consolidated through increased M&A
activity. Given the sustained fragmented nature of the industry, this trend is expected to continue in the near to
intermediate term. Reflecting the strong customer preference for national and increasingly global scale providers and
the operational and cost advantages of having local density, large contract security services providers continue to gain
market share. Together, Allied Universal and G4S will hold a leading market position and we expect to further growth
market share in the security services industry in the United States and globally in connection with the business
combination.


-----

**Competitive Strengths**

**Largest Security Services Provider Worldwide**

Following the G4S Acquisition, Allied Universal has become the global leader in security services and the
acquisition reinforced our number one position in North America. Combined with G4S, we increased our scale and
density, further enhancing our ability to deliver consistent, high quality services across our operations infrastructure.

We have achieved industry-leading growth over the last decade through both organic and accretive M&A
activities. We serve a significant portion of Fortune 500 companies, and generated Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
Revenues of $18,357.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. See “—Summary Historical Consolidated and
Pro Forma Combined Financial Information” for a reconciliation of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenues to
revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP and/or IFRS measure. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, we employ approximately 740,000 security professionals and operate in more than 225 locations in all
50 US states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and have a growing presence in Canada, Brazil, Colombia,
Peru, Argentina, Chile, Benelux, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, UAE, India, Australia, Thailand, Hong Kong, South
Africa, Morocco and Kenya.

Our national scale also enables us to serve strategic industry verticals such as high-rise offices, aerospace
and defense, higher education and healthcare. With the acquisition of G4S, Allied Universal has significant density in
local markets in the United States and regional markets worldwide, which drives a competitive advantage in serving
our customers, providing a location-specific approach with the benefits of a global platform. Our local density enables
us to serve a wide range of client sizes while achieving operational leverage at the branch level by keeping overhead

G4S Acquisition enhances Allied Universal’s Local Density and Ability to Serve in Each Market

Note: Shows hours per week (HPW) in each region before and after the G4S Acquisition.

**Consistent, Recession-Resistant Industry**

The resilient nature of the security services market was demonstrated during the COVID pandemic, which
reaffirmed the essential nature of services provided by Allied Universal. Early in the pandemic, security professionals
were generally deemed essential by health authorities and continued to deliver security services to a range of
customers. Minor business disruptions at the onset of lockdowns led to a slight pullback in hours relative to the preCOVID period. Allied Universal has so far successfully managed the pandemic and performance has been highly
resilient both in top line growth and in margin expansion. Hours have since rebounded and even increased in some
regions as COVID-related restrictions have eased and economic activity continues to rebound, while increased
security concerns remain. Services have continued to expand as customers seek a partner to help implement and
execute new policies and procedures at guarded sites, in addition to offering additional services such as temperature
checks. An enhanced focus on innovative technology solutions drives further upside for security providers that offer
fully integrated solutions.

Allied Universal’s resilient top-line is driven by the contractual revenue streams with daily re-occurrence of
services, the critical nature of security to operations, and the low cost of security services relative to the high cost of
failure. The company typically benefits from rising wages as increases are passed on to clients, who generally expect
a 2% to 3% annual increase in billing rates, in-line with wage growth. Tightening labor markets result in stable
margins, while softer markets typically drive margin expansion as the increased supply of labor reduces the spread
between bill rates and employee pay rates.

**Compelling Growth Tailwinds in the United States and Across the Globe**

The critical and non-discretionary nature of security services to customers is driving stable, consistent growth
both in the United States and globally. The US security services market generated approximately $66 billion in revenue
in 2020, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2021 and 2025. Globally, the manned guarding market
generated approximately $34 billion in revenue in 2020, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% from 2021 to 2025.
The international technology security services market generated approximately $8 billion in revenue in 2020, and is
expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% from 2021 to 2025. Demand for high quality security services continues to grow
through heightened focus on security, increasing public safety awareness and the growing need to supplement services
provided by the public sector. The trend of outsourcing to high quality providers such as Allied Universal will continue
to be supported by a compelling value proposition, increasing security complexity and centralization of security
programs. There is a low risk of technology disruption as only manned security is considered an active deterrent to
perceived security threats. Further, technology solutions enhance rather than displace manned guarding and Allied
Universal provides customers with a best-in-class technology integrated service offering. These tailwinds, combined
with attractive end-market growth across diversified verticals, support attractive market growth across all key
geographies serviced by the combined company.

**Highly Diversified Revenue Mix Across High Growth Customer Base**

In the United States, Allied Universal has a highly diversified revenue mix across all major regions and
metropolitan areas, end markets, and customers. We have limited customer concentration, as our top 10 customers
account for 10.7% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, with no customer contributing more than 1.9%
of revenue during that period. Finally, we serve a variety of distinct vertical segments, none of which account for more
than 11% of revenue. This end market diversification shields us from industry-specific shocks and allows us to provide
vertical-specific solutions necessitated by the increasing complexity of security issues in different end markets. We
also benefit from our commercial real estate customers’ diverse tenant base and most of our mall clients being
considered “class A” (representing high sales per square foot), which achieve steadier foot traffic and higher guard
penetration.

The combined company will benefit from an expanded blue-chip client base, including a significant portion
of the Fortune 500, and vertical market clients, as well as a diversified revenue mix across North America, Asia
Pacific, Europe & Middle East, and Africa. The largest revenue mix by customer type is major corporate & industrial,
which accounted for roughly 21% of combined revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, followed by
government, with 13% of combined revenue, financial institutions, with 9% of combined revenue, retail and malls,
with 7% of combined revenue, technology, media and telecommunication, with 6% of combined revenue, commercial
real estate, with 6% of combined revenue, transportation and logistics, with 6% of combined revenue, chemical and
energy/utilities, with 6% of combined revenue, healthcare, with 5% of combined revenue, manufacturing and
industrial, with 3% of combined revenue, aerospace and defense, with 2% of combined revenue, and education, with
2% of combined revenue, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2020. This geographical and end-market
diversification provides us mobility to continue to grow revenue through multiple channels.

Board Array of Customers Served

**Blue Chip Customers, High Customer Retention Rates**

We serve a diverse base of blue-chip clients across a variety of industries and regions. Currently, our client
portfolio includes members of the Fortune 500 companies and is characterized by long-term relationships and high
retention rates.

Select Blue Chip Clients


-----

We have historically fostered long-term client relationships through our:

    - commitment to providing high-quality, responsive services;

    - active client service, sales and marketing efforts;

    - wide geographic scope and client-centric approach; and

    - consistent service offerings.

These characteristics are responsible for Allied Universal’s highly recurring client bases which have had over
90% revenue retention over the last 5 years.

Allied Universal additionally has a platform for serving premier customers in the United States, which we
define as clients with greater than $5 million of annual revenue across multiple regions and with a central point of
contact for purchasing security services. Our large national footprint in the United States and operational scale with
local density across the country enables us to be well-positioned to meet the needs of premier customers. We have a
contractual revenue base, with three to five year contracts for large customer accounts, and one-year evergreen
contracts for smaller accounts. We use a data-driven sales and account management process to take proactive measures
to expand and renew contracts well ahead of contract expiration.

**Premier Employer in the Industry with Better Than Industry Training and Employee Retention**

Client satisfaction is at the heart of our success and we rely on our employees to deliver consistent, highquality service. To ensure industry-leading service, we have cultivated a strong corporate culture that focuses on
personal career development and we reward long-term, quality service. We offer competitive compensation with
above-average security provider hourly wages, comprehensive training programs, career management tools,
leadership training and performance assessment processes for managers and executives to ensure that they are
attracting, engaging with, and retaining the highest quality security officers. We ensure that security professionals
have the appropriate training for each client need; for example, portions of our security professionals have military
service experience and CPR certification. Additionally, our commitment to the professional development of our
employees has resulted in 65% of managerial positions being filled through internal promotion. Lower employee
turnover rates reduce recruiting, screening, training costs and increases service quality for our customers, facilitating
long-term, stable relationships. Employee culture is also a key focus at G4S, where 84% of employees reported a
favorable view of the company in its 2019 global employee survey, with the results used to inform both local
engagement plans and company-wide initiatives.

In addition, Allied Universal has consistently been recognized for superior employee training and talent
development programs. Over the past several years, we received additional awards, including Chief Learning Officer
magazine’s LearningElite Award, The American Society for Training & Development Excellence in Practice Award,
Chief Executive Magazine’s Best Private Companies for Leaders Award, and Orange County Business Journal’s Best
Places to Work award.

Allied Universal’s digital employee engagement and safety solutions, including our proprietary Mercury
solution, provide consistent and reliable electronic communication channels with our approximately 250,000 security
professionals, ensuring collaborative interactions, including “on the clock” training, assignments delivery and
schedule modifications.

We have implemented an automated hiring and recruiting process, which includes an artificial intelligence
enhanced interview process and progresses applicants on a 24-7-365 basis. We use custom algorithms to qualify and
screen candidates based on top Allied Universal current security professionals, enabling managers and operators in
field to focus on client service rather than recruiting.

Finally, our proprietary business intelligence tool is utilized by thousands of managers in the business to
optimize pricing, staffing, safety and compliance.

**Stable and Predictable Financial Performance Coupled with Strong Free Cash Flow Generation**

_Consistent history of growth: Allied Universal has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to deliver growth,_
consistent and improving profitability, and strong cash flow. The nature of our customer contracts fosters a highly
visible financial model. Our recurring revenue base is supported by an above-average customer retention rate. To drive
revenue growth, both companies target new client wins, in particular the expansion of the premier customers portfolio
within Allied Universal, expanded scope of work and customer penetration with existing clients, added
complementary technology solutions, and consistent increases in price in line with wage rate growth and the delivery
of high- quality services. These organic growth drivers, coupled with our ability to execute upon accretive acquisition
opportunities, have contributed to strong revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth. From 2005 to 2020, Allied
Universal’s standalone organic revenue CAGR was approximately 6% and from 2017 to 2020, Allied Universal
consistently grew the spread between bill rates and wage rates per hour by approximately 4.5%. Allied Universal’s
disciplined acquisition strategy combined with strong organic growth has allowed us to become the fastest growing
security services company in the industry while maintaining strong free cash flow generation. The combination
between Allied Universal and G4S is expected to drive further topline and profitability growth through significant
cross-selling and cost synergy opportunities.

_Highly-variable cost structure drives predictable margins: Bill rate, which is the price we charge to our_
customers per hour per security officer, is priced as a mark-up on security officer pay rates, which is the wage we pay
to security guards per hour. From 2016 to 2020, Allied Universal’s mark-up has remained constant at 1.48x. This
stable mark-up reflects the strong track record of passing on cost increases to clients and expanding margins. Our
ability to pass through labor costs and other variable expenses to our clients allows us to generate consistent
profitability and produce cash flows with low volatility. This consistency helps us maintain stable operating margins
and provides a baseline level of profitability from which further margin expansion can be achieved as we continue to
increase our operating leverage and scale, while reducing general and administrative expenses.

_Capital-light business model supports strong cash flow: Our minimal capital requirements and strong_
working capital management support our strong cash flow profile. Capital expenditures over the past three years were
approximately 1.8% of annual revenue on average, with cash capital expenditures representing about half of such
capital expenditures and the remaining portion funded through capital leases. We also have minimal and predictable
net working capital needs, which provides further visibility into free cash flow.

**Proven Platform for Continued Organic Growth and Disciplined Approach to M&A**

We have demonstrated consistent growth, both organically and inorganically. We have historically grown
approximately 6% organically, driven by our best-in-class service offering, continued scale increase, technologically
advanced offerings and strong secular tailwinds. Utilizing a disciplined approach, we have demonstrated a strong track
record of sourcing, executing and integrating both tuck-in and transformative acquisitions. Through these acquisitions,
we have achieved meaningful cost synergies as well as customer, end market and geographic diversity. We have
completed 72 acquisitions since 2007 with a majority being proprietary opportunities acquired at mid-single digit
purchase multiples. We have historically achieved approximately 98% revenue retention within the 12 months postacquisition, further demonstrating our ability to successfully integrate targets onto our platform while continuing to
provide high quality service to customers. We continue to maintain a propriety pipeline of potential targets as we
continue to execute our roll-up strategy.

**Highly Experienced Management Team**

We have a highly experienced and well-respected management team with a proven track record and
meaningful equity ownership. Management was responsible for developing and implementing the expansion strategy
that has led to industry-leading growth for the company. The team has a strong track record of continuously evolving
and growing the business through both organic and M&A strategies, and is experienced in integrating accretive
acquisitions. The team is committed to delivering continued growth, and has significant equity ownership in Allied
Universal. Outside of the executive management group, there is a deep bench of leadership and operational talent
throughout the organization given the selection of the best security specialists in connection with the merger of
AlliedBarton and Universal in 2016.

**Growth Strategy**

**Proven Ability to Win New Clients and Grow with Existing Clients**

Our underlying organic growth has historically been driven by hours growth attributable to (i) developing a
world-class sales and marketing organization, (ii) leveraging our competitive advantages to win new customers,
including premier customers, (iii) expanding customer penetration and leveraging cross-selling opportunities with
clients by delivering customized service offerings specific to customer needs, and (iv) maintaining steady underlying
customer retention rates in the 90% range in the long term, and pricing growth driven by passing on pay rate increases
to customers. In order to drive new customer wins for Allied Universal, our sales organization is structured by
salespeople focused on premier customers, salespeople focused on regional and local accounts, vertical market
specialists, and regional specialists. Our sales pipeline is robust, with the pipeline typically representing a multiple of
the annual new starts target. Premier customers sales efforts target customers with facilities in multiple locations
throughout the United States, who increasingly desire consistency of service, fewer points of contact and alignment
with a national partner providing a full suite of capabilities. As we have expanded our geographical footprint and
adapted sales and client service capabilities, we have become well-positioned to be the leading provider to premier
customers . With our existing customers, we seek to grow customer penetration by increasing the number of customer
sites served and thus the hours that our security officers cover, and adding on different types of security services. Our
organic growth is supported by underlying customer retention rates in the 90% range over the past 10 years. Given
the multi-year contractual nature of many of our large contracts, we have visibility over a significant portion of our


-----

revenue . We proactively manage contracts in advance of renewal, rebid or expiration. Finally, organic growth has
been driven by increasing pricing in line with security officer pay rate increases. We have demonstrated a history of
successfully increasing bill rates with pay rates, as evidenced by stable mark-up rate and increasing mark-up spread
over the long term.

We have grown our revenue at a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2005 and 2020. We believe we are
well-positioned to continue achieving measured growth by capitalizing on our strong reputation, enhanced operational
capabilities, vertical-specific service expertise and premier customers platform. In addition to increasing hours by
adding new accounts, benefiting from increased outsourcing, we will continue to leverage our significant experience
managing pricing dynamics to drive growth.

**Service Line Expansion**

The combination of Allied Universal and G4S is expected to generate meaningful cross-selling opportunities.
The combined comprehensive offering of security solutions across a global platform will allow the combined business
to serve as a one-stop-shop for existing customers served by the combined group, as well as new clients looking for a
global provider to serve their security needs. The expertise of each organization in serving specific end markets and
geographies will increase the overall reach and ability to serve global clients across a range of industries with a host
of complimentary services.

Our industry-leading manned guarding services provide a platform from which to continue offering
additional services. To date, we have utilized this platform to offer additional services, such as physical technology
systems, including video surveillance, CCTV picture capture and monitoring, robot patrolling, GPS based patrol and
reporting, online threat monitoring, and managing access control points and centralized security operation.
Additionally, we also offer integration services to design, install and service fully integrated technology-based
monitoring systems. Finally, we provide digital solutions and remote monitoring through MaRC.

Our acquisition of Securadyne in April 2019 further strengthened our ability to consult, design, deploy,
integrate and maintain electronic security systems for our customers. We believe the Securadyne acquisition provided
us with the footprint and scalable infrastructure that enables us to deliver complementary security integration services
to a significantly larger portion of the existing approximately 50,000 client sites where we provide manned guarding
services today.

In addition to system installation, maintenance, robots, and monitoring, we have integrated technology into
our manned guarding services and are in the process of deploying a custom IMS that provides real-time incident data
reporting and situational awareness information powered by artificial intelligence. The proprietary application,
HeliAUS, provides in-depth incident reporting, data collection, and predictive analytics, allowing managers and
clients to spot trends and react quickly, while improving workforce supervision and improving liability management.
The highly scalable platform is delivered to customers via a monthly subscription and is billed directly to users as a
supplement to manned guarding services.

Beyond our technology offerings, we intend to continue to grow our janitorial and staffing services, which
are a portfolio of offerings including cleaning services and a provider of skilled talent across a diverse set of industries
such as traditional janitorial functions as well as highly specialized cleaning services such as bio- hazard disposal, IT
room cleaning, and recycling programs.

**Proven Platform for Disciplined M&A**

We benefit from our significant experience in successfully integrating acquisitions while maintaining
relationships with both existing and acquired customers. The largely fragmented security services industry has
historically provided opportunities to supplement our strong organic growth with a disciplined acquisition strategy. A
large and fragmented international market, as well as relevant adjacent markets, provides additional opportunity for
targeted expansion. Our approach to acquisitions has been highly methodical and focused on scale-building and infill
acquisitions. Integration occurs quickly, generally within 30 days for a typical tuck-in acquisition, making for a
seamless transition for customers.


-----

Allied Universal has proven experience executing all types of transactions, including 72 small tuck-ins and
large transformational acquisitions since 2007. On average, these acquisitions were completed at credit accretive, midsingle digit multiples. In addition to many small and medium tuck-ins, we have a proven track record of successfully
executing and integrating transformative acquisitions, as evidenced by the combination of AlliedBarton and Universal
in August 2016, as well as the large tuck-in acquisition of USSA, formerly the fourth-largest manned guarding
provider in the United States in 2018. The combination of our smaller tuck-in acquisitions along with our ability to
acquire targets of scale, such as USSA, demonstrate our disciplined ability to take advantage of growth opportunities
as they become available.

We believe we are an “acquirer of choice” due to our strong reputation and track record and are the bestpositioned consolidator in a highly fragmented market. A significant portion of our past acquisitions have been
completed on a proprietary basis. Additionally, we estimate that over 40% of the outsourced manned guarding services
market in the United States is comprised of over 7,000 firms and roughly 60% of the security technology services
market is comprised of over 3,000 firms, providing a large opportunity set for further accretive consolidation. We
benefit from significant industrial logic from on-boarding sub-scale providers onto our scalable platform which drives
the ability to expand margins of acquired companies. We believe the combination of Allied Universal and G4S will
allow us to execute further our disciplined and well-demonstrated M&A playbook in key markets globally.

**Customers; Competition**

Through understanding our customers’ needs, we aim to offer value added, innovative, cost effective security
solutions and build enduring relationships. We engage with our customers through a variety of methods, including a
consultative approach to selling and bidding for contracts, proactive relationship management and a sharp focus on
customer service. Key areas of interests for customers include quality and price of service delivery, expertise and
innovation, health and safety and business ethics. However, the industries in which we operate are competitive. We
directly compete with companies that are national and international in scope. We also compete with smaller local and
regional companies that may have better knowledge of the local conditions in their regions, are better known locally
and are better able to gain customers in their regions. There are relatively low barriers to entry in the industries in
which we operate, and we have faced and expect to continue to face additional competition from new entrants. We
also face increased competition from technology companies as digital advancement develops, which may lead to
pricing pressure and service changes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—The
industries in which we operate are intensely competitive and price-sensitive. If we cannot successfully compete with
new or existing providers of products and services similar to ours or enhance our existing products and services, our
results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.”

The United States contract security officer industry is highly competitive but fragmented. We also compete
with numerous smaller regional and local security service providers in the United States.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the security service market are:

  - the quality of security officers, including length of service and tenure;

  - supervision, recruiting, selecting and training of security officers;

  - management quality and responsiveness;

  - the ability to handle multiple sites nationwide; and

  - price in relation to the quality of service.

Rapid technological advances, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and
software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs
and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete.


-----

**Government Regulation**

We are subject to a large number of city, county and state, domestic and international laws and regulations
governing the provision of private security services. Relevant regulation for our operations and employees includes
such matters as consumer protection, fair trade, jurisdiction-specific security industry regulation (including with
respect to hardware requirements or operational requirements), data privacy, occupational health and safety, marketing
and competition law. Additionally, most states in the United States have laws, or legislation pending, requiring
qualification, training and registration of security officers, regulating the use of identification cards, badges and
uniforms and imposing minimum bond surety or insurance standards. In order to install a security system, we generally
must be licensed in the jurisdiction where we are installing the system. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Business and Industries—Our business operates in a regulated industry, and noncompliance with regulations could
materially restrict our operations and expose us to fines, penalties and other liabilities and negative consequences.”
Additionally, we generally must obtain operating certificates or permits for our security systems, and provide specified
levels of training to our employees at those centers.

Our international operations are subject to risks that are different from those we face in the United States and
subject us to complex and frequently changing laws and regulations, including differing labor laws and regulations
relating to the protection of certain information that we collect and maintain about our employees, clients and other
third parties. We operate under many complex and diverse regulatory frameworks, some of which have extraterritorial
reach and many where regulations change frequently. Among these laws are the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, the U.K.
Bribery Act, and the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and
Industries—Our international business involves risks different from those we face in the United States that could have
an effect on our results of operations and financial condition.”

**Intellectual Property**

Allied Universal’s most material trademarks are “AU” and “ALLIED UNIVERSAL,” together with other
variants containing the term “ALLIED.” G4S’s most material trademarks are “G4S” and “Securing Your World.”
Neither Allied Universal nor G4S has had any significant difficulties registering any trademarks, nor are there any
known limitations on the ownership or use of, or problems with respect to, the digital or online presence of, its
respective key brands.

**Employees**

On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we employ approximately 740,000 security
professionals and operate in more than 225 locations in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. As
of the date of this offering circular, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, approximately 26% of
our employees were unionized. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good, and we have not
experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes.

With over 740,000 security professionals on a combined basis delivering critically important services across
every continent, employee and customer safety is of paramount importance to us. We have a continuing focus on
enhancing safety policies, standards and culture and our goal is zero harm. The nature of our work and the
environments in which we operate mean that security and safety present an operational and strategic risk to our
business and, from time to time, members of our workforce may be subject to injuries and fatalities. We believe that
setting the highest standards for health and safety across our industry helps to keep our security professionals safe and
builds employee loyalty and commitment to our combined company.

**Insurance**

We believe that we maintain all appropriate forms of insurance, including comprehensive general liability,
performance and crime bonding, professional liability, automobile coverage and excess and umbrella coverage.
Special coverage is sometimes added in response to unique customer requirements. We also maintain compliance with
all state workers’ compensation laws.


-----

We maintain insurance coverage, subject to certain self-insured retention limits, for workers’ compensation,
general liability, employment practices liability and healthcare claims (under employee medical benefit plans).
Medical benefit costs for the majority of our workforce are premium-based. Costs associated with the premium-based
plans equal the actual premiums paid. Conversely, for administrative employees and select security officers’ medical
coverages, we are self-insured and subject to self-insured retention limits.

**Properties**

Allied Universal’s corporate office is located at 1551 North Tustin Avenue, Suite 650, Santa Ana, CA 92705.
G4S’s corporate office is located at 5th Floor, Southside, 105 Victoria Street, London, SW1E 6QT. On a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we operate nationwide in the United States with services throughout the
50 states, as well as in over 90 countries globally.

All of our facilities are leased and none are owned. We believe that if we were unable to renew the lease on
any of these facilities, we would be able to lease other suitable facilities on commercially reasonable terms. We do
not believe that any individual facility or lease is material to our business.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are and, from time to time, may become party to regulatory proceedings or to litigation or subject to nonlitigated claims arising out of the normal operations of our businesses such as general liability and employment claims.
We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these claims and proceedings. For a description of certain ongoing and
past litigations, see “Risk Factors—Risk Related to Our Business—We are subject to risks from litigation or legal
proceedings, as well as tax audits, which could adversely affect our financial results and condition.”

Under the laws of many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be held liable for the negligent acts
or misconduct of our agents or employees performed while on duty and in the course and scope of their employment.
We experience a significant volume of claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business asserting that we are
liable for damages as a result of the conduct of our employees or others. From time to time individuals bring personal
injury lawsuits against us seeking substantial damages based on alleged negligence or other theories of liability in our
provision of security services, including with respect to injuries not directly caused by, or within the control of, our
security officers. Under principles of common law, we generally can be held liable for wrongful acts or omissions to
act of our agents or employees during the course, and within the scope, of their agency or employment with us.

In addition, many of our customer contracts contain provisions whereby we are contractually obligated to
defend, indemnify and hold harmless our clients. These provisions vary from indemnification for our own negligence
and misconduct to providing indemnification for any claims related to our services regardless of our fault. In a limited
number of situations, we may also be contractually required to indemnify our customers in cases of their own
contributory negligence.

We are also subject to a significant number of wage and hour class actions and multi-plaintiff lawsuits, singleemployee lawsuits, Private Attorneys General Act claims and attorney demands, in addition to wage and hour
governmental audits.

We maintain insurance coverage, subject to certain self-insured retention limits, for workers’ compensation,
general liability, employment practices liability and healthcare claims (under employee medical benefit plans), which
we believe adequately insure us. We also seek to mitigate this risk exposure through indemnification or liability
limitations in our contracts, analysis of customer facilities and implementation of programs for employee screening,
training, supervision and safety and anonymous reporting by our employees. We believe that we have established
adequate reserves for litigation liabilities in our consolidated financial statements.

Currently, we are involved in certain legal and governmental matters, such as the DPA that G4S entered into
with the SFO in respect of the UK Care & Justice electronic monitoring contract investigation, inquiries that G4S
received from the BCA and DoJ in connection with G4S’s Belgian business, class action litigation relating to the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act relating to alleged support provided by G4S to the Taliban


-----

in Afghanistan and certain claims in India relating to the India Provident Fund, as further described under “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—The nature of our business exposes us to significant risks
related to legal proceedings, claims, governmental inquiries and investigations, and negative press and media
investigations that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, and results of operations,” “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—We are subject to risks from litigation or legal proceedings,
as well as tax audits, which could adversely affect our financial results and condition” and “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to Our Business and Industries—The security services we provide may subject us to liability for substantial
damages not covered by insurance.” We currently do not expect any of these matters nor any other legal or
governmental matters we are involved in to have a material adverse effect on our combined business, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows, but we can provide no assurance on the future developments or outcomes
of any such arbitrations and/or legal proceedings discussed in this offering circular, including the G4S matters
discussed above. Exposure to litigation is inherent in our ongoing business and may materially harm our combined
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.

Claims of holders of the notes offered hereby will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our
subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes offered hereby.” In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation,
reorganization or similar proceeding of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will
pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the
Issuer, the Co-Issuers or a Guarantor, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuers, including Holders. As a result, all of
the existing and future liabilities of our Non-Guarantors, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally
senior to the Secured Notes. Although the Secured Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.
The Secured Indenture will not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness that may be
incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the Non-Guarantors. See “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Issuers and the Guarantors (exclusive of the Target and
its consolidated Subsidiaries) represented approximately 95.6% of the Issuer’s total revenues, 85.0% of the Issuer’s
total assets and 95.6% of the Issuer’s total liabilities, after excluding intercompany transactions and balances.

In addition and subject to certain exceptions and the Agreed Security Principles, the Target and each of the
Target’s material Subsidiaries incorporated in the United States, Luxembourg and England and Wales will guarantee
the Secured Notes by the later of (i) 150 days after the Issue Date and (ii) the date on which such U.S. or Foreign
Subsidiaries provide a Guarantee under the Senior Credit Facilities. As of and for the year ended December 31,
2020, Target entities organized in the United States, Luxembourg and England and Wales represented
approximately 49.0% of the Target’s total revenues and 61.0% of the Target’s total assets.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Secured Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent
the Secured Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference
under applicable law, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of
foreign or state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. In
addition, the Secured Note Guarantees provided by Guarantors that are Foreign Subsidiaries will be further limited
as required under the Agreed Security Principles.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
Covenants—Liens,” in respect of guarantees or collateral provided by or over the assets of (or equity interests in)
Foreign Subsidiaries, certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights


-----

and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The
following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among
others:

(a) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and
other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalisation,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign
_corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules_
and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or
approval requirements and similar principles;

(b) the determination that the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes (including, in
respect of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, their investors and/or their shareholders),
interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs guarantee fees payable to any
Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and all applicable legal fees) would be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee
or security;

(c) the determination that, in respect of any guarantee or security which it is determined may be required
to be discharged and/or released in connection with any corporate, tax structuring or other
reorganization of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (an “Anticipated Reorganization”), the
applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty,
registration taxes, notarial costs guarantee fees payable to any person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary and all applicable legal fees) of taking, and then subsequently discharging
and/or releasing such guarantee or security in connection with any Anticipated Reorganization, will
not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such
guarantee or security;

(d) subject to certain exceptions, that members of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in any
jurisdiction outside of the United States of America (other than Atlas LuxCo 1 S.à r.l. or any whollyowned subsidiary of Atlas LuxCo 1 S.à r.l.) will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
Security Documents if they are not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary or if it is not within the legal
capacity of the relevant members of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or if it would conflict
with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory
or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal
or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries;
_provided that reasonable efforts (for a period of not more than 10 Business Days but without_
incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome
any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

(e) the agreement that guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and
all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an
amount to be agreed between the Issuer and the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent in accordance
with the terms of the corresponding Credit Agreements;

(f) the agreement that where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if
the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such
security, security will be granted over the material assets only;

(g) the agreement that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

(h) the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract,
lease, licence, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or
regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from


-----

being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a
consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which,
if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or
otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially
adverse to the interests of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or any member thereof; provided
that reasonable efforts (for a period of not more than 20 Business Days but without incurring
material cost) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries if the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such
efforts will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

(i) the agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the
perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on
the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct their operations and business in
the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Secured Notes Documents (including dealing with
the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or
allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Event of Default which
is continuing);

(j) the agreement that any security document will only be required to be notarised if required by law in
order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

(k) the agreement that, on request, no guarantee or security will be required to be given (and no consent
shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) by or over any acquired entity or business
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Target and its Subsidiaries) which are required to
guarantee, secure or otherwise credit support Indebtedness acquired in connection with an
acquisition which is not prohibited by the Secured Notes Documents (or in each case (Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness) (“Applicable Debt”) to the extent such indebtedness
is permitted by the Secured Notes Documents to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member
of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition not prohibited by the Secured
Notes Documents (or the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries making such acquisition) shall be
required to become a guarantor or grant security with respect to any Secured Notes Documents if
prevented by the terms of the documentation governing the Applicable Debt or if becoming a
Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment
obligation) under or in relation thereto. No security or Lien in favour of the other Secured Parties
will be granted or continue to subsist over any asset of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
secured for the benefit of any Permitted Indebtedness (including Applicable Debt) and to the extent
constituting a Lien permitted by the Secured Notes Documents;

(l) the agreement that no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title
insurance will be required;

(m) the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third
party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which
do not prohibit or prevent the creation of security over such accounts) or any cash constituting
regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant
security document);

(n) the agreement that neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary will be required to take any
action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment, sub-participation or
transfer by any relevant secured party (and unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Secured
Notes Documents the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not bear or otherwise be liable for
any taxes, any notarial registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result
from any assignment, sub-participation or transfer by any relevant secured party);


-----

(o) the agreement that each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any
transaction not prohibited under the Secured Notes Documents and the security granted under each
security document entered into after the Issue Date shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed
Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant security document and creation of
the relevant security;

(p) the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover
or sharing provisions (or any substantially equivalent provisions) in the Intercreditor Agreements;

(q) the agreement that the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at
the relevant time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under
the terms of the Secured Notes Documents prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is
continuing;

(r) the agreement that no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap
_Obligations” defined in accordance with the Loan Syndications and Trading Association’s (the_
“LSTA”) Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations'
_Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;_

(s) the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing
or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(t) the agreement that no fixed security will be required to be granted over real estate, intellectual
property, letter of credit rights, tort claims (or the equivalent in any jurisdiction), insurance policies,
aircraft, ships and vessels, motor vehicles, governmental contracts or governmental or regulatory
licenses;

(u) the agreement that no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to
any security will be required to be prepared or provided to the relevant secured party (or any agent
or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) unless (i) required for such
documents to become effective or admissible in evidence, and (ii) an Event of Default is continuing;

(v) the fact that closure, unavailability, or reduced service of any governmental or regulatory systems,
any functions or any facilities (including notarial or legal facilities) necessary or customarily used
for the granting of security or guarantees, or the taking of any perfection requirements in connection
therewith, may affect and/or delay the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to provide
a guarantee or security or take any related steps in connection with any perfection requirements; and

(w) the agreement that where the terms of a security document require a party thereto (other than any
secured party) to use its “reasonable efforts,” “reasonable endeavours” or a similar or equivalent
standard in taking an action thereunder, notwithstanding any meaning to the contrary as a matter of
the governing law of such security document, such standards shall be interpreted and construed in
accordance with the law of England and Wales and no Default or Event of Default (howsoever
described) shall arise under any Secured Notes Documents in respect of a breach of such obligation
because a contrary construction of such provision was taken (or would be taken by any applicable
court of competent jurisdiction).

By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Secured Note Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Secured Note Guarantee. If a Secured Note Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be
declared entirely void or subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other
contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability
on its Secured Note Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and
the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain


-----

circumstances, to avoid the notes offered hereby and the guarantees, and the liens securing the secured notes offered
hereby and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes offered hereby, the guarantees and the
liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes offered
hereby to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens in respect of the secured notes
offered hereby and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes offered hereby.” The validity and
enforceability of the Secured Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations
described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
Guarantees and Security Interests.”

The Secured Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon:

(1) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor after which
the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets
of such Guarantor (including to the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or another Guarantor), in each case, if such
sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the
Secured Indenture;

(2) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of its
Guarantees of payment (i) by the Issuer of any Indebtedness of the Issuer under the Senior Credit
Facilities or (ii) as a result of the Guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Issuers or a Guarantor which
resulted in the creation of such Secured Note Guarantee, except in the case of clause (i) or (ii), a release
or discharge by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it being understood that a release
subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release) and will constitute a release for the
purposes of this provision, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Secured Note Guarantee
shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Secured
Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(3) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Secured Indenture or the occurrence of any event after
which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions
of the Secured Indenture;

(4) the exercise by the Issuers of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as provided in
“—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the satisfaction and discharge of the Issuers’
obligations under the Secured Indenture as provided in “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) to the extent that such Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of clause
(i) of the definition of “Immaterial Subsidiary,” upon the release of the Guarantee referred to in such
clause;

(6) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer, the CoIssuers or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with
the applicable provisions of the Secured Indenture;

(7) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Secured Notes; provided that such Secured
Note Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and

(8) as described under the caption “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Secured Note Guarantee by a Parent Entity may be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged for any reason.


-----

**Ranking**

The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Secured Notes and the payment of any
Secured Note Guarantee will rank pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of
the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, including the obligations of the Issuer, the
Co-Issuers and such Guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing
2027 Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Notes.

The Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees will be effectively senior in right of payment to all of the
Issuer’s, the Co-Issuers’ and any Guarantor’s existing and future unsecured Indebtedness to the extent of the value
of the assets securing the Secured Notes. As of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, the Issuers and the Guarantors would have had Secured Indebtedness of approximately
$9,120.0 million outstanding (excluding capitalized leases), including borrowings and the related guarantees under
the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Secured Notes with $300.0 million and €300.0
million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facilities under the Credit Agreements and
$1,500.0 million available for borrowing under the ABL Credit Facility, without giving effect to approximately
$275.0 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2020, which, if drawn, would be Secured
Indebtedness.

Although the Secured Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur the amount of such additional Indebtedness could be substantial and,
in any case, such Indebtedness may be Secured Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness. See “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Secured Notes**

The Issuers will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Secured Notes. The initial Paying Agent for the
USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 and the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 will be the Trustee, and the initial Paying
Agent for the Euro Secured Notes and the Sterling Secured Notes will be The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A. The Issuers will also maintain one or more registrars and a transfer agent. The initial registrar and
transfer agent with respect to the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 and the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 will be the
Trustee, and the initial registrar and transfer agent with respect to the Euro Secured Notes and the Sterling Secured
Notes will be The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. The applicable registrar will maintain a register
reflecting ownership of the Secured Notes outstanding from time to time. The registered Holder will be treated as
the owner of a Secured Note for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Secured Indenture.
The applicable Paying Agent will make payments on the Secured Notes, and the applicable transfer agent will
facilitate transfer of Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuers. Payments of principal of, premium and Additional
Amounts, if any, and interest on the Secured Notes will be payable at the office or agency designated by the Issuers
or, at the option of the Issuers, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their respective
addresses set forth in the register of Holders. Until otherwise designated by the Issuers, the Issuers’ office or agency
maintained for such purpose will be the office of the applicable Paying Agent.

The Issuers may change the Paying Agents, the registrars or the transfer agents without prior notice to the
Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a Paying Agent, registrar or transfer agent. However, for so
long as any series of Secured Notes is listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority
so require, the Issuers will notify the Authority of any change of Paying Agent, registrar or transfer agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Secured Notes in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture and
the restrictions set forth in the section of this Offering Circular entitled “Transfer Restrictions.” The applicable
registrar, the applicable Paying Agent and the Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Secured Notes. Holders will be required to pay all Taxes due on
transfer. The Issuers will not be required to transfer or exchange any Secured Note selected for redemption or


-----

tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer, an Asset Sale Offer or
other tender offer. Also, the Issuers will not be required to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Secured
Note during the period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of redemption of Secured Notes or between a
record date and the next succeeding interest payment date.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuers will issue an aggregate principal amount of (i) $900.0 million of USD Secured Notes Tranche 1,
(ii) $775.0 million of USD Secured Notes Tranche 2, (iii) €813.0 million of Euro Secured Notes and (iv) £367.7
million of Sterling Secured Notes in this offering. The Secured Notes will mature on       , 2028. Subject to
compliance with the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the Issuers may issue additional USD
Secured Notes Tranche 1 (any such notes, the “Additional USD Notes Tranche 1”) and/or additional USD Secured
Notes Tranche 2 (any such notes, the “Additional USD Notes Tranche 2”) and/or additional Euro Secured Notes
(any such notes, the “Additional Euro Notes”) and/or additional Sterling Secured Notes (any such notes, the
“Additional Sterling Notes” and, together, with the Additional USD Notes Tranche 1, the Additional USD Notes
Tranche 2 and the Additional Euro Notes, the “Additional Notes”) from time to time after the Issue Date under the
Secured Indenture. Any Additional Notes issued in the future under the Secured Indenture will be identical in all
respects to the applicable series of Secured Notes that we are issuing on the Issue Date, except that the Additional
Notes issued in the future may have different issue prices and will have different issue dates, first interest payment
dates and first dates from which interest will accrue; provided that if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the
applicable series of Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Additional Notes will be issued with a
separate CUSIP, ISIN, Common Code or other identifying number. The applicable Secured Notes offered by the
Issuers and any corresponding Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Secured Indenture will be treated as a
single class for all purposes under the Secured Indenture (except as otherwise provided herein), including waivers,
amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Secured
Notes” for all purposes under the Secured Indenture and this “Description of Secured Notes” include any Additional
Notes that are actually issued. The USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 and the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 will be
issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Euro
Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and any integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. The Sterling Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and any integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, none of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream, the Trustee
or any other Agent is required to monitor or enforce the minimum amount.

Interest on the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 will accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on the
USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 will accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on the Euro Secured Notes will
accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on the Sterling Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per
annum. Interest on the Secured Notes for each applicable series will be payable semi-annually in arrears
on         and         , commencing on         , 2021, to the Holders of record of Secured Notes of such
applicable series, on the immediately preceding          and          . Interest on the Secured Notes for each
applicable series will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been
paid, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Secured Notes for each applicable series will be computed
on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Security**

The Secured Notes, Secured Note Guarantees and the other Secured Notes Obligations will have the benefit of
the “Collateral,” which will consist of (i) the Notes Collateral, as to which the Holders of the Secured Notes, holders
of the Credit Agreement Obligations, holders of the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and future Other Pari Passu Lien
Obligations (if any) will have a first-priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) and the ABL Lenders and
the other holders of ABL Obligations will have a second-priority security interest, and (ii) the ABL Collateral, as to
which the ABL Lenders and the other holders of ABL Obligations will have a first-priority security interest and the
Holders of the Secured Notes, holders of the Credit Agreement Obligations, holders of the Existing 2026 Secured
Notes and future Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any) will have a second-priority security interest (subject to


-----

Permitted Liens). The Collateral granted by or over the assets of or equity interests in any Foreign Subsidiary will be
subject to the Agreed Security Principles.

**_Notes Collateral_**

The Notes Collateral will be pledged as collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee,
the Notes Collateral Agent, the other Agents and the Holders of the Secured Notes. The Notes Collateral will also be
pledged as collateral to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Credit Agreement Obligations.
The Secured Notes and Secured Note Guarantees, together with the Credit Agreement Obligations, the Existing
2026 Secured Notes and future Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any), will be secured by first-priority security
interests in the Notes Collateral, subject to Permitted Liens. The Notes Collateral generally consists of substantially
all present and future tangible and intangible assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors (including, all of the Capital
Stock owned by the Issuers or any Guarantor other than Excluded Equity Interests) and in each case other than
(i) the ABL Collateral and (ii) Excluded Assets.

Initially, subject to Permitted Liens, only the Secured Notes, the Secured Note Guarantees, the other Secured
Notes Obligations, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Credit Agreement Obligations will have the benefit of
the first-priority security interest in the Notes Collateral. Except for Indebtedness secured by Permitted Liens
(including the Credit Agreement Obligations and, subject to the terms described herein, future Indebtedness
constituting Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations), no other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuers or any Guarantor may
share in the first-priority security interest in the Notes Collateral.

The Issuers and the Guarantors will grant a second-priority Lien on and security interest in the Notes
Collateral for the benefit of the ABL Lenders and the other holders of ABL Obligations, which initially will consist
of the loans outstanding under the ABL made by the ABL Lenders, obligations with respect to letters of credit
issued under the ABL, certain hedging obligations incurred pursuant to a Secured Hedge Agreement and Banking
Product Obligations and any other ABL Obligations under the ABL. Any additional Indebtedness that is incurred by
the Issuers or any Guarantor in compliance with the terms of the Secured Indenture may also be given a Lien on and
security interest in the Notes Collateral that ranks pari passu or junior to the Lien of the Noteholder Secured Parties
in the Notes Collateral. See “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Except as provided in the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement, holders of junior Liens on the Notes Collateral will not be able to take any enforcement action with
respect to the Notes Collateral so long as any Secured Notes are outstanding.

**_ABL Collateral_**

The ABL Collateral will be pledged as collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee,
the Notes Collateral Agent, the other Agents and the Holders of the Secured Notes. The ABL Collateral will also be
pledged as collateral to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Credit Agreement Obligations.
The Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees, together with the other Secured Notes Obligations, the Credit
Agreement Obligations, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and future Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any), will
be secured by second-priority security interests in the ABL Collateral, subject to Permitted Liens. The ABL
Collateral generally consists of the following assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors (other than Excluded Assets)
whether now owned or hereafter acquired:

     - accounts (including credit card receivables) and all other rights to payment arising from services

rendered or from the sale, lease, use or other disposition of inventory, whether such rights to payment
constitute payment intangibles, letter-of-credit rights or any other classification of property, or are
evidenced in whole or in part by instruments, chattel paper or documents;

     - inventory and documents relating to inventory;

     - all rights of an unpaid vendor with respect to inventory;

     - deposit accounts (other than accounts constituting Excluded Assets separately maintained insurance

deposit accounts and deposit accounts maintained solely to hold proceeds of Notes Collateral (a
“Collateral Account”)), commodity accounts, securities accounts and lockboxes, including all money
and certificated securities, uncertificated securities (other than Capital Stock of Subsidiaries of the
Issuers and the Guarantors), securities entitlements and related investment property (including all cash,


-----

marketable securities and other funds held in or on deposit in any deposit account, commodity account
or securities account), and all cash and cash equivalents, including cash and cash equivalents securing
reimbursement obligations in respect of letters of credit or other ABL Obligations;

     - instruments, chattel paper and general intangibles pertaining to the other items of property otherwise

comprising ABL Collateral (other than any Capital Stock of Subsidiaries of the Issuers and Guarantors
and intellectual property);

     - books and records, supporting obligations, documents and related letters of credit, letter-of-credit rights,

commercial tort claims or other claims and causes of action, in each case, to the extent arising out of,
related to or given in exchange or settlement of any of the foregoing; and

     - all substitutions, replacements, accessions, products and proceeds (including, without limitation,

insurance proceeds, licenses, royalties, income, payments, claims, damages and proceeds of suit) of all
or any of the foregoing.

All terms used in the preceding paragraph and defined in the UCC and not otherwise defined in this offering
circular have the meanings given to such terms in the UCC; provided that the term “instrument” has the meaning
given to such term in Article 9 of the UCC.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL
Collateral will not include any identifiable cash proceeds from a sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of any
Notes Collateral that has been deposited in the Collateral Account in accordance with the terms of the Secured
Indenture, the Collateral Documents and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, until such time as such cash proceeds
are released therefrom in accordance with the terms of such agreements.

**_Limitation on Certain Collateral and Perfection Items_**

The Issuers and their Subsidiaries will not be required under the terms of the Secured Indenture or the
Collateral Documents to deliver landlord lien waivers, estoppels or collateral access letters and will not be required
to subject any accounts (other than any Collateral Account), securities accounts or commodities accounts to control
agreements; provided that Collateral shall not include any Excluded Assets or Excluded Equity Interests. Any
Collateral granted by or over the assets of or equity interests in a Foreign Subsidiary will be subject to the Agreed
Security Principles.

**_Possession of the Collateral_**

Subject to the terms of the Collateral Documents, and unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and the Notes Collateral Agent or, subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements, the ABL
Collateral Agent, Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or Existing 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent shall have
commenced enforcement of remedies with respect to the Collateral, the Issuers and the Guarantors will have the
right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Obligations under the
Secured Notes, the Secured Note Guarantees and the Secured Indenture (other than any cash, securities and Cash
Equivalents constituting part of the Collateral and deposited with the Notes Collateral Agent or the ABL Collateral
Agent, as applicable in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Documents), to freely operate the Notes
Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes—Sales of assets by the issuers and the guarantors could reduce the collateral and the
related guarantees.” Any Collateral granted by or over the assets of or equity interests in a Foreign Subsidiary will
be subject to the Agreed Security Principles.

**_Information Regarding Collateral_**

The Issuers will furnish to the Notes Collateral Agent, with respect to the Issuers or any Guarantor (other than
where such Person is a non-U.S. Issuer or Guarantor), prompt written notice of any change in such Person’s
(i) organizational name, (ii) jurisdiction of organization or formation, (iii) identity or organizational structure or
(iv) organizational identification number. The Issuers and the Guarantors will agree to make all filings under the
UCC or equivalent statutes, or otherwise that are required by applicable law in order for the Notes Collateral Agent


-----

to continue at all times following such change to have a valid, legal and perfected security interest in all the
Collateral.

**_Further Assurances and After-Acquired Property_**

Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in the Collateral Documents and subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and the Secured Indenture (including with respect to Excluded Assets), the Issuers and the Guarantors
shall execute any and all further documents, financing statements, applications for registration, agreements and
instruments, and take all further action that may be required under applicable law, or that the Notes Collateral Agent
may reasonably request, in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security
interests created or intended to be created by the Collateral Documents in the Collateral. Subject to the applicable
limitations set forth in the Collateral Documents and the Secured Indenture (including with respect to Excluded
Assets), if, after the Issue Date, the Issuers or a Guarantor acquire property that is not automatically subject to a
perfected security interest (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) under the Collateral Documents and such
property constitutes or would constitute Collateral (including, without limitation, any asset of the Issuers or a
Guarantor that becomes Collateral subsequent to the Issue Date as a result of such asset ceasing to be an Excluded
Asset) or an entity becomes a Guarantor, then the Issuers or such Guarantor will promptly provide for security over
such property (or, in the case of a new Guarantor, its assets of the type that would constitute Collateral under the
Collateral Documents) in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and deliver certain joinder agreements or supplements
as required by the Secured Indenture and the Collateral Documents and take all actions required by the Collateral
Documents and the Secured Indenture to perfect the liens created by the Collateral Documents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Discharge of the ABL Obligations, the Issuers and the Guarantors
shall only be required to comply with the foregoing requirements with respect to any ABL Collateral to the extent
that such ABL Collateral is concurrently being pledged to secure the ABL Obligations.

**_Collateral Documents and Certain Related Intercreditor Provisions_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Notes Collateral Agent (on
behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Secured Notes) will enter into one or more Collateral Documents
creating and establishing the terms of the security interests that secure the Secured Notes and the Secured Note
Guarantees. These security interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the obligations of
the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Secured Notes, the Secured Indenture, the Secured Note Guarantees and the
Collateral Documents, as provided in the Collateral Documents. The Issuers and the Guarantors will complete all
filings and other similar actions required by the Collateral Documents in connection with the provision and/or
perfection of security interests in the Collateral that may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the
UCC and the pledge of the Capital Stock of any Domestic Subsidiary (to the extent not constituting an Excluded
Asset), in each case on the Issue Date. In addition, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to complete all other filings and other similar actions required by the Collateral Documents in
connection with the provision and/or perfection of security interests on other Collateral on the Issue Date, but to the
extent they are unable to do so without undue burden or expense, will in any event complete such actions promptly
following the Issue Date. Wilmington Trust, National Association will be appointed, pursuant to the Secured
Indenture, as the Notes Collateral Agent. The Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent, the other Agents and each Holder
of Secured Notes and each other holder of, or obligee in respect of, any Obligations in respect of the Secured Notes
outstanding at such time are referred to collectively as the “Noteholder Secured Parties.”

With regard to any property upon which a security interest must be perfected, pursuant to the Collateral
Documents and the Agreed Security Principles such security interests and Liens will be created under the Collateral
Documents in form and substance reasonably necessary to grant to the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of the
Holders of the Secured Notes, a security interest in such collateral and the Issuers and the Guarantors shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Holders of the Secured Notes, all such
instruments and documents (including certificates, legal opinions and lien searches) as are necessary to evidence
compliance with this covenant and required by the Collateral Documents.


-----

**ABL Intercreditor Agreement**

The Notes Collateral Agent will enter into a joinder, dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuers, the other
grantors party thereto, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent, the Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent and the ABL Collateral Agent (the “ABL Joinder”), to the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement, dated as of July 12, 2019, among the Issuers, the other grantors party thereto, the Existing 2026 Secured
Notes Collateral Agent, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the ABL Collateral Agent (together with the
ABL Joinder, the “ABL Intercreditor Agreement”), which ABL Intercreditor Agreement may be further amended
and/or supplemented as necessary in the event that additional permitted Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations are
incurred. Although the Holders of the Secured Notes will not be party to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, by their
acceptance of the Secured Notes they will agree to be bound by the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and
be deemed to have authorized and directed the Notes Collateral Agent to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. If any other Indebtedness is designated as Other Pari Passu Lien
Obligations and is permitted by the terms of the Secured Indenture, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes Indenture, the
Credit Agreements and the ABL (or any other applicable Credit Facility) to be secured by the Collateral on a pari
passu basis with the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees, the representatives of the holders of such
Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations will also become party to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement. See also “—Pari Passu Intercreditor Arrangements.”

Pursuant to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, prior to the discharge of the Obligations with
respect to the Secured Notes, the Secured Note Guarantees and the Secured Indenture, the Existing 2026 Secured
Notes and the Credit Agreement Obligations (and Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any)), the “Applicable
Authorized Representative” under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will determine the time and method by
which the security interests in the Notes Collateral will be enforced and, prior to the Discharge of the ABL
Obligations, the ABL Collateral Agent will determine the time and method by which the security interests in the
ABL Collateral will be enforced.

**_Lien Subordination_**

Notwithstanding the time, order or method of creation, attachment or perfection of any Lien in respect of any
ABL Collateral and notwithstanding any provision of any applicable law, any security document or any other
document or instrument, the Notes Collateral Agent will agree on behalf of the Noteholder Secured Parties that the
Liens of the Notes Collateral Agent in respect of the ABL Collateral shall be expressly subordinate and junior in
right, priority, operation and effect to any Lien of the ABL Collateral Agent in respect of the ABL Collateral. The
ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides for subordination of the ABL Collateral Agent’s Lien with respect to the
Notes Collateral and the priority of the Notes Collateral Agent’s, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes Collateral
Agent’s and the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent’s Liens with respect to the Notes Collateral.

**_No Action with Respect to the ABL Collateral_**

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that, with respect to the ABL Collateral, none of the Noteholder
Secured Parties (or holders of Credit Agreement Obligations, holders of the Existing 2026 Secured Notes or holders
of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any)) may (or may direct the Notes Collateral Agent, the Existing 2026
Secured Notes Collateral Agent, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or any representative with respect to Other
Pari Passu Lien Obligations, if applicable, to) (i) commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with
respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to
take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise exercise or join any other
person in exercising any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interest
in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of any ABL Collateral, other than certain limited
protective measures, (ii) challenge or question in any proceeding the validity or enforceability of any ABL
Obligations or related security document, or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien securing
ABL Obligations, or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties established by or other provisions
of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or
could be, to interfere with, hinder or delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale,
transfer or other disposition of the ABL Collateral by any ABL Secured Parties, (iv) (A) direct the ABL Collateral
Agent or any holder of ABL Obligations to exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to the ABL Collateral


-----

or (B) consent to the exercise by any ABL Secured Party of any right, remedy or power with respect to the ABL
Collateral, (v) itself institute any suit or assert in any suit or Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding any claim against
any ABL Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or
otherwise with respect to, and no ABL Secured Party shall be liable for, any action taken or omitted to be taken by
such ABL Secured Party with respect to any ABL Collateral and (vi) seek, and such Noteholder Secured Parties
waive any right, to have any ABL Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition
of such ABL Collateral. In addition to the foregoing, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the ABL
Collateral Agent has the exclusive right to take any enforcement action with respect to the ABL Collateral without
any consultation with and without the consent of any Noteholder Secured Party (or holder of Credit Agreement
Obligations, holder of the Existing 2026 Secured Notes or holder of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any)). The
ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides reciprocal limitations on the ABL Secured Parties’ rights to take action with
respect to the Notes Collateral.

**_Collateral Access Rights_**

If the ABL Collateral Agent takes any enforcement action with respect to the ABL Lien Collateral, the Pari
Notes Debt Secured Parties (i) shall cooperate with the ABL Agent (at the sole cost and expense of the ABL Agent
and subject to the condition that the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties shall have no obligation or duty to take any
action or refrain from taking any action that could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any liability
or damage to the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties) in its efforts to enforce its security interest in the ABL Collateral
and to finish any work-in-process and assemble the ABL Collateral, (ii) shall not take any action designed or
intended to hinder or restrict in any respect the ABL Agent from enforcing its security interest in the ABL Collateral
or from finishing any work-in-process or assembling the ABL Collateral, and (iii) subject to the rights of any
landlords under real estate leases, shall permit the ABL Agent, its employees, agents, advisers and representatives, at
the sole cost and expense of the ABL Secured Parties and upon reasonable advance notice, to enter upon and use the
Notes Collateral (including equipment, processors, computers and other machinery related to the storage or
processing of records, documents or files), for a period not to exceed 180 days after the taking of such enforcement
action, for purposes of taking reasonable actions to protect, secure and otherwise enforce the rights of the ABL
Secured Parties in and to the ABL Collateral; provided, however, that nothing contained in the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement shall restrict the rights of any Pari Notes Debt Agent from selling, assigning or otherwise transferring
any Notes Collateral prior to the expiration of such 180-day period if the purchaser, assignee or transferee thereof
agrees to be bound by this provisions. If any stay or other order prohibiting the exercise of remedies with respect to
the ABL Collateral has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, such 180-day period shall be tolled during
the pendency of any such stay or other order.

Each Pari Notes Debt Agent and each Pari Notes Debt Secured Party, in its capacity as a secured party (or as a
purchaser, assignee or transferee, as applicable), and to the extent of its interest therein, has granted or will grant to
the ABL Agent and the ABL Secured Parties a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use,
license or sublicense any and all intellectual property now owned or hereafter acquired included as part of the Notes
Collateral (and including in such license access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or
stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof) as is or may be
necessary or advisable in the ABL Agent’s reasonable judgment for the ABL Agent to collect or otherwise realize
upon any accounts receivable comprising ABL Collateral, in each case solely in connection with any exercise of
remedies available to the ABL Secured Parties; provided that (i) any such license shall terminate upon the sale of the
applicable ABL Collateral and shall not extend or transfer to the purchaser of such ABL Collateral, (ii) the ABL
Agent’s use of such intellectual property shall be reasonable and lawful, and (iii) any such license is granted on an
“AS-IS” basis, without any representation or warranty whatsoever. Furthermore, each Pari Notes Debt Agent agrees
that, in connection with any exercise of remedies available to any Pari Notes Debt Agent in respect of Notes
Collateral, such Pari Notes Debt Agent shall provide written notice to any purchaser, assignee or transferee of
intellectual property pursuant to such exercise of remedies, that the applicable intellectual property is subject to such
license.

**_Tracing of Proceeds of ABL Collateral and Notes Collateral_**

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to an issuance of any Enforcement Notice with respect
to Collateral or the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, any proceeds of Collateral,


-----

whether or not deposited under Account Agreements, which are used by any Grantor to acquire other property
which is Collateral shall not (solely as between the ABL Agent, the ABL Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the
Pari Notes Debt Agents and the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties) be treated as proceeds of Collateral for purposes of
determining the relative priorities in the Collateral which was so acquired. In addition, unless and until the discharge
of ABL Obligations occurs, the Pari Notes Debt Agents and the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties by consent to the
application, prior to the receipt by the ABL Agent of an Enforcement Notice issued by any Pari Notes Debt Agent,
of cash or other proceeds of Collateral, deposited under control agreements to the repayment of ABL Obligations
pursuant to the ABL documents; provided that after the receipt by the ABL Agent of an Enforcement Notice from
any Pari Notes Debt Agent, any identifiable proceeds of Notes Collateral (whether or not deposited under Account
Agreements with the ABL Agent) shall be treated as Notes Collateral.

**_No Duties of the ABL Secured Parties_**

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that none of the ABL Secured Parties have any duty or liability
and each Noteholder Secured Party (and each holder of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (including Credit
Agreement Obligations and the Existing 2026 Secured Notes)) waives, under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, all
claims against any of the ABL Secured Parties arising out of any and all actions any ABL Secured Party may take or
permit or omit to take (including with respect to the foreclosure upon, sale, release or depreciation of, or failure to
realize upon, the ABL Collateral) in accordance with the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Documents or any
other agreement related thereto or the collection of the ABL Obligations or the valuation, use, protection or release
of any security for the ABL Obligations. In addition, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the ABL
Collateral Agent is entitled to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of or deal with the ABL Collateral without regard to
the second-priority security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent on such ABL Collateral or any rights to which any
Noteholder Secured Party (or holder of Credit Agreement Obligations, holder of the Existing 2026 Secured Notes or
holder of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any)) would otherwise be entitled as a result of such second-priority
security interest.

**_Payment Over; No New Liens Reinstatement_**

Each Pari Notes Debt Agent will agree that if it shall obtain possession of any ABL Collateral or shall realize
any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral, pursuant to any security document or by the exercise of
any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other
exercise of remedies, at any time prior to the associated discharge of ABL Obligations secured, or intended to be
secured, by such Collateral, then it shall hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the ABL Secured
Parties and transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the ABL Agent reasonably
promptly after receiving written notice from the ABL Secured Parties that it has possession of such Collateral or
proceeds or payments in respect thereof.

In addition to the foregoing, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Grantors will not, and will not
permit their Subsidiaries to, grant any new Lien to the Notes Collateral Agent or any other Pari Notes Debt Agent on
any of their property unless such Grantor or, as the case may be, such Subsidiary, has granted (or offered to grant
with a reasonable opportunity for such Lien to be accepted) a Lien on such property in favor of the ABL Collateral
Agent for the benefit of the ABL Secured Parties as security for the ABL Obligations, with the priorities set forth in
the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that any Collateral is subject to a Lien securing the Obligations
under the Secured Notes, the Secured Note Guarantees and the Secured Indenture and is not subject to a Lien
securing the ABL Obligations, the Notes Collateral Agent will (x) hold and be deemed to have held such Lien and
security interest on such property for the benefit of the holders of ABL Obligations with respect to such property as
security for the ABL Obligations, or (y) if directed by the holders of the ABL Obligations with respect to such
property constituting ABL Collateral, take any actions that are necessary to make such Lien subject to the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement and provide the benefit of such Lien to the holders of the ABL Obligations with respect to
such property. The Grantors will agree to similar provisions regarding additional Liens on the Notes Collateral, and
the ABL Secured Parties will agree to reciprocal limitations and release and assignment provisions with respect to
their rights in the Notes Collateral.

In the event that any of the ABL Obligations shall be paid and such payment or any part thereof shall
subsequently, for whatever reason (including an order or judgment for disgorgement of a preference or other


-----

avoidance under the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar law, or the settlement of any claim in respect thereof), be
required to be returned or repaid, the terms and conditions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement shall be fully
applicable thereto until all such ABL Obligations shall again have been paid in full in cash.

**_Agreements with Respect to Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings_**

If the Issuers or any other Grantor becomes subject to a bankruptcy case or any other voluntary or involuntary
insolvency or liquidation proceeding and, as a debtor-in-possession, moves for approval of financing under
Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code (“Post-Petition Financing”) or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Noteholder Secured Parties (and the
holders of Credit Agreement Obligations, holders of the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and holders of Other Pari
Passu Lien Obligations (if any)) will not raise an objection, and will waive any claim such person may have, to any
such financing or to the Liens on the ABL Collateral securing the same, or to any use of cash collateral that
constitutes ABL Collateral or to any grant of administrative expense priority under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy
Code, unless (A) the ABL Secured Parties, or ABL Collateral Agent, shall then oppose or object to such PostPetition Financing or such Liens or such use of cash collateral, (B) such Liens are neither senior to, nor rank equal
with, the ABL Secured Parties’ Liens upon any property of the estate in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding or
(C) such Post-Petition Financing shall not provide that cash collateral consisting of ABL Collateral (including ABL
Collateral arising after the commencement of such insolvency proceeding) shall be required to be remitted to the
ABL Agent in accordance with the ABL Debt Documents for permanent application to the ABL Obligations unless
otherwise agreed by the ABL Agent. To the extent such Post-Petition Financing Liens are senior to, or rank equal
with, the ABL Secured Parties’ Liens, each Pari Notes Debt Agent will, for itself and on behalf of the other Pari
Notes Debt Secured Parties of the applicable series, subordinate their Liens on the ABL Collateral to (i) the ABL
Secured Parties’ Liens (and all adequate protection liens on the ABL Collateral granted to the ABL Secured Parties)
and the Post-Petition Financing Liens and (ii) any “carve out” for professional fees and United States Trustee fees
and other payments from the ABL Collateral agreed to by the ABL Collateral Agent, so long as the Pari Notes Debt
Secured Parties retain their valid, perfected and unvoidable Liens on all the ABL Collateral, including proceeds
thereof arising after the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, with the same priority as
existed prior to the commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Code.

The ABL Secured Parties will agree to reciprocal limitations with respect to any Post-Petition Financing
secured with Liens on the Notes Collateral on a senior basis to those of the ABL Secured Parties.

Each Pari Notes Debt Secured Party will agree that it will not object to or oppose (i) a sale or other disposition
of any ABL Collateral (or any portion thereof) under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of
the Bankruptcy Code if the ABL Secured Parties shall have consented to such sale or disposition of such ABL
Collateral and all secured parties’ Liens will attach to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition with the same
priorities set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) any lawful exercise by any holder of claims in respect
of any ABL Obligations of the right to credit bid such claims under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any
other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or in any sale in foreclosure of ABL Collateral.

**_Adequate Protection and Cash Collateral_**

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Noteholder Secured Parties (and holders of Credit
Agreement Obligations, holders of the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and holder of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations
(if any)) will not oppose (or support the opposition of any other Person) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding
to (A) any motion or other request by any ABL Secured Party for adequate protection with respect to ABL Agent’s
Liens upon the ABL Collateral, including any claim of any ABL Secured Party to post-petition interest, fees, or
expenses as a result of the ABL Lien on the ABL Collateral (so long as any post-petition interest, fees, or expenses
paid as a result thereof is not paid from the proceeds of Notes Collateral and is allowable under Section 506(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code), a request for the application of proceeds of ABL Collateral to the ABL Obligations, and request
for additional or replacement Liens on post-petition assets of the same type as the ABL Collateral and/or a
superpriority administrative claim, or (B) any objection by any ABL Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or
proceeding based on such ABL Secured Party claiming a lack of adequate protection with respect to the ABL Liens
in the ABL Collateral. In addition, the ABL Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Secured Parties, may seek
adequate protection of its junior interest in the Notes Collateral in the form of an additional or replacement Lien on


-----

post-petition assets of the same type as the Notes Collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim, subject to
the provisions of this Agreement; provided that each Pari Debt Notes Agent is also granted adequate protection in
the same form that is granted to the ABL Agent, which additional or replacement Lien on post-petition assets of the
same type as the Notes Collateral or superpriority administrative claim (as applicable) is senior to that granted to the
ABL Agent in respect of the Notes Collateral. Such Lien on post-petition assets of the same type as the Notes
Collateral and/or superpriority administrative claim, if granted to the ABL Agent, will be subordinated to the
adequate protection Liens and/or superpriority administrative claims (as applicable) granted in favor of each Pari
Notes Debt Agent on such post-petition assets, and, if applicable, to the debtor-in-possession financing Liens of each
Pari Notes Debt Agent or any other Pari Notes Debt Secured Party on such post-petition assets of the same type as
the Notes Collateral. If the ABL Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Secured Parties, seeks or requires (or is
otherwise granted) adequate protection of its junior interest in the Notes Collateral in the form of an additional or
replacement Lien on post-petition assets of the same type as the Notes Collateral and/or a superpriority
administrative claim, then the ABL Agent, for itself and the ABL Secured Parties, will agree that each Pari Notes
Debt Agent shall also be granted an additional or replacement Lien on such post-petition assets and/or a
superpriority administrative claim as adequate protection of its senior interest in the Notes Collateral and that the
ABL Agent’s additional or replacement Lien on post-petition assets of the same type as the Notes Collateral and/or
superpriority administrative claim (as applicable) shall be subordinated to the additional or replacement Lien on
post-petition assets of the same type as the Notes Collateral and/or superpriority administrative claim of each Pari
Notes Debt Agent on the same basis as the Liens of the ABL Agent on, and claims with respect to, the Notes
Collateral are subordinated to the Liens of each Pari Notes Debt Agent on, and claims with respect to, the Notes
Collateral under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. If the ABL Agent or any ABL Secured Party receives as
adequate protection a Lien on post-petition assets of the same type as the ABL Collateral, then such post-petition
assets shall also constitute ABL Collateral to the extent of any allowed claim of the ABL Secured Parties secured by
such adequate protection Lien and shall be subject to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Refinancings of and Amendments to the Senior Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes and Other Pari Passu Lien_**
**_Obligations_**

Subject to the limitations set forth in the Secured Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities may be amended,
renewed, replaced, exchanged, extended, modified or supplemented from time to time in any manner, all without
affecting the subordination of the Liens in favor of the Noteholder Secured Parties and the other Pari Notes Debt
Secured Parties relative to the Liens in favor of the ABL Secured Parties.

**Pari Passu Intercreditor Arrangements**

The Notes Collateral Agent will enter into a joinder, dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuers, the other
grantors party thereto, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and the Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent (the “Pari Passu Joinder”) to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of July
12, 2019, among the Issuers, the other grantors party thereto, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and
the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent (together with the Pari Passu Joinder, the “Pari Passu Intercreditor
_Agreement”), which Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement may be further amended and/or supplemented as necessary_
in the event that additional permitted Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations are incurred.

By their acceptance of the Secured Notes, the Holders will agree to be bound by the terms of the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed to have authorized and directed the Notes Collateral Agent to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The term “Collateral” as used in
the description of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement means the Collateral on which the collateral agents of two
or more classes of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority have a valid and perfected Lien. Under the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will be represented by the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of the
Existing 2026 Secured Notes will be represented by the Existing 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent, the holders
of the Credit Agreement Obligations will be represented by the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the holders
of each class of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations will be represented by their designated agent (each, an
“Authorized Representative”). The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides for the priorities and other relative
rights among the Holders of the Secured Notes, the holders of the Credit Agreement Obligations, the holders of the


-----

Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the holders of the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations, including, among other
things, that:

(1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of
any Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes, the Credit Agreement Obligations, the
Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations, the Liens securing all
such Indebtedness shall be of equal priority; and

(2) the Obligations in respect of the Secured Notes, the Credit Agreement Obligations, the Existing
2026 Secured Notes and the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations may be increased, extended,
renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, refunded, refinanced or otherwise
amended from time to time, in each case, to the extent permitted by the Secured Indenture, the
Credit Agreements, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes Indenture and the documentation
governing the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations.

The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement also provides that only the “Applicable Authorized Representative”
will have the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. Upon completion of
this offering, we expect the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will be the Applicable Authorized Representative
until such time as the occurrence of a Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such date, the
“Applicable Authorized Agent Change Date”). Following the Applicable Authorized Agent Change Date, the Major
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative, will become the Applicable Authorized Representative.

As of any date, the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” is the Authorized Representative of
the largest class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority then-outstanding (other than the same class as the
class of Indebtedness represented by then Applicable Authorized Representative). The “Non-Controlling Authorized
_Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 120 days (throughout which 120-day period the applicable_
Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both
(a) an event of default under the terms of the class of Indebtedness represented by such Authorized Representative
and (b) the Notes Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that
Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative and that an event of default with respect to the class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu
Lien Priority represented by the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative has occurred and is continuing
and (ii) such class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority is currently due and payable in full (whether as a
result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of that class of Indebtedness having Pari
Passu Lien Priority; provided that such event of default under the terms of the class of Indebtedness represented by
such Authorized Representative shall be continuing at the end of such 120-day period; provided, further, that the
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be
deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative
has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral; (2) at any time the
Issuers or any other Grantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with
respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or (3) at any time the Applicable
Authorized Representative is stayed under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement from pursuing enforcement action with
respect to such Collateral.

Only the Applicable Collateral Agent will and will have the right to exercise, or refrain from exercising, any
rights, remedies and powers with respect to the Collateral, including any action to enforce their respective security
interest in or realize upon any Collateral and any right, remedy or power with respect to any Collateral under any
intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), and then only on the instructions of the
Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not be required to, and shall not,
follow any instructions or directions with respect to Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement
with respect to any Collateral) from any Non-Controlling Secured Party, it being understood and agreed that,
notwithstanding any such instruction or direction by the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable
Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose such collateral agent to
liability or be contrary to any security document or applicable law, and (iii) no Non-Controlling Secured Party shall,
or shall instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings
with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any


-----

action to take possession of, take any other action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or exercise any
other right, remedy or power with respect to (including any right, remedy or power under any intercreditor
agreement other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) any Collateral, whether under any credit document,
applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the Applicable Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of
the Applicable Authorized Representative and in accordance with the applicable security documents, shall be
entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such rights, remedies and powers with respect to Collateral.
Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens established under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the
Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) may deal with
the Collateral as if such collateral agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Secured Party will
contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the
Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party, or any other exercise by the Applicable
Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights,
remedies or powers with respect to the Collateral, or seek to cause either Collateral Agent to do so.

“Applicable Collateral Agent” means (i) until the earlier of (x) the discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations
and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent
and (ii) from and after the earlier of (x) the discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the Additional Collateral Agent.

“Additional Collateral Agent” means, with respect to the Shared Collateral (x) for so long as the Secured
Notes are the only class of Indebtedness outstanding, the Notes Collateral Agent and (y) thereafter, the Collateral
Agent of the same class as the Authorized Representative that is the Applicable Authorized Representative with
respect to such Collateral at such time.

“Controlling Secured Parties” means, at any time with respect to any Collateral, (i) at any time when the
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Credit Agreement Secured Parties and
(ii) at any other time, the Secured Parties of the same class as the Authorized Representative that is the Applicable
Authorized Representative with respect to such Collateral at such time.

“Non-Controlling Secured Parties” means, at any time with respect to any Collateral, the Secured Parties that
are not Controlling Secured Parties at such time with respect to such Collateral.

If (i) an event of default has occurred and is continuing under any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority, and any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in
respect of any Collateral, (ii) any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the
Issuers or any other Grantor or (iii) any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party receives any
payment with respect to any Collateral pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement), the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any
Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or exercise of
remedies, and any such distributions or payments received by Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured
Party, will be applied among the Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority to the payment in full of all such
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Notes
Collateral Agent, any other collateral agent with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority and the
other Authorized Representatives, in their capacities as such. None of the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu
Lien Priority may institute any suit or assert in any suit or other proceeding any claim against the Notes Collateral
Agent, any other collateral agent with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority or any other holder of
Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions
or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of
such Collateral. If any holder of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority obtains possession of any Collateral or
realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, in each case, as a result of the enforcement of remedies, at any
time prior to the discharge of each of such Indebtedness, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in
trust for the other holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority and promptly transfer such Collateral,
proceeds or payment to the Applicable Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority of each class (and not the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class) bear
the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any Indebtedness having Pari Passu
Lien Priority of such class is unenforceable under applicable Law or is subordinated to any other obligations (other
than to any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class), (ii) any Indebtedness having Pari Passu
Lien Priority of such class does not have a valid and perfected Lien on any of the Collateral securing any
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists
securing any other obligations (other than Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security
interest of such class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority but junior to the security interest of any other
class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority, or (b) the existence of any Collateral securing Indebtedness
having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class that does not constitute Collateral with respect to Indebtedness
having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class (any condition referred to in clause (a) or (b) with respect to
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class being referred to as an “Impairment” of such class). In
the event an Impairment exists with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any class, the results
of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such
class, and the rights of such holders (including the right to receive distributions in accordance with the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the results of such Impairment are borne
solely by such holders.

**Release of Collateral**

The Issuers and the Guarantors will be entitled to the releases of property and other assets included in the
Collateral from the Liens securing the Secured Notes including pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles or under
any one or more of the following circumstances:

     - to enable the sale or other disposition of such property or assets, including Capital Stock (other than to

Issuers or a Guarantor), to the extent not prohibited under the covenant described under the caption “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock;”

     - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Secured Note Guarantee, the release of the property

and assets of such Guarantor;

     - to the extent such Collateral is comprised of property leased to the Issuers or a Guarantor, upon

termination or expiration of such lease;

     - with respect to Collateral that is Capital Stock, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the issuer of that

Capital Stock that is not prohibited by the Secured Indenture;

     - with respect to any Collateral that becomes an “Excluded Asset” or that becomes subject to certain

Permitted Liens; or

    - as described under the caption “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

In the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of the ABL Collateral or any such ABL Collateral
becoming excluded collateral under the ABL Debt Documents (regardless of whether or not an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing under the Secured Notes Documents at the time of such sale, transfer or other disposition
or any such ABL Collateral becoming excluded collateral under the ABL Debt Documents), the Lien on such ABL
Collateral securing the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees will terminate and be released automatically
and without further action if the Liens of the ABL Agent on such Collateral are released and if such sale, transfer or
other disposition either (A) is then not prohibited by the Secured Notes Documents or (B) occurs in connection with
the foreclosure upon or other exercise of rights and remedies with respect to such ABL Collateral (including, in
connection with any liquidation of ABL Collateral consented to by the ABL Agent); provided that such Lien
securing the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees shall remain in place with respect to any proceeds of a
sale, transfer or other disposition under this paragraph that remain after the associated discharge of ABL
Obligations. The first priority Liens on the Notes Collateral securing the Secured Notes and the Secured Note
Guarantees shall also terminate and be released automatically in connection with a sale, transfer or disposition of
Notes Collateral that occurs in connection with the foreclosure of, or other exercise of remedies with respect to,


-----

Notes Collateral by any collateral agent under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement (except with respect to the
proceeds of such sale, transfer or disposition).

The security interests in all Collateral securing the Secured Notes also will be released upon (i) payment in
full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts on, the Secured Notes and
all other obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations for which no demand has been made) under the
Secured Indenture, the Secured Note Guarantees under the Secured Indenture and the Collateral Documents that are
due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, is paid, or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Secured Indenture as described below
under the caption “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or a discharge of the Secured Indenture as
described under the caption “—Satisfaction and Discharge.”

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuers are not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Secured Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer to purchase Secured
Notes as described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” As market conditions warrant, we
and our equity holders, including the Investors, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may
from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Secured Notes, in privately
negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained
in the agreements governing our Indebtedness, including the Secured Indenture, any purchases made by us may be
funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including
borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually
or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular
class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any
such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related
adverse tax consequences to us.

Secured Notes of such series in such tender offer and the Issuers, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu
of the Issuers, purchases all of the Secured Notes of such series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such

given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Secured Notes of such series that remain

their sole discretion) by the Redemption Date, or by the Redemption Date as so delayed, or at any time in the
Issuers’ discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Issuers any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied. In
addition, the Issuers may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the
Issuers’ obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If the optional Redemption Date for a series of Notes is on or after a record date and on or before the

excluding, the Redemption Date on such series will be paid on the Redemption Date to the Holder in whose name
the applicable Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, and no additional interest will be payable
to Holders whose Secured Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuers.

The Secured Notes of any series to be redeemed shall be selected in accordance with the procedures in the
manner described under the caption “—Selection and Notice.”

_Redemption_ _Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on_
the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date) and all Additional Amounts, if any,
then due or that will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise if the

thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in official position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations, protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a government agency or court of
competent jurisdiction)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), any Payor, with respect to the Secured Notes
or a Secured Note Guarantee is, or on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Secured
Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to such Payor (including the appointment of a new paying agent or, where such action
would be reasonable, payment through another Payor); provided that no Payor shall be required to take any
measures that in the Issuers’ good-faith determination would result in the imposition on such person of any material
legal or regulatory burden or the incurrence by such person of additional material costs, or would otherwise result in
any material adverse consequences to such person.

In the case of any Payor, the Change in Tax Law with respect to a given Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction must
become effective on or after the later of the date of this Offering Circular or the date a jurisdiction becomes a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication, mailing or delivery of any notice of redemption of the Secured Notes pursuant to
the foregoing, the Issuers will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that they are entitled to effect
such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to their right so to
redeem have been satisfied (including that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the
Payor taking reasonable measures available to it) and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized
standing to the effect that the Payor would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax


-----

Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction in
which any successor to a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any termination,
defeasance or discharge of the Secured Indenture.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of any Issuer or any Guarantor or any successor in interest to any of the
foregoing (each, a “Payor”) on or with respect to any series of the Secured Notes or any Secured Note Guarantee (in
each case, other than with respect to USD Secured Notes Tranche 1) will be made without withholding or deduction
for, or on account of, any Taxes unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Secured Notes or Secured Note Guarantee is

made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax, by
such Payor; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor that actually makes a payment on the Secured Notes or its Secured

Note Guarantee is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered
to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax (each of clauses (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payors or the Paying Agent
with respect to any Secured Note or Secured Note Guarantee (in each case, other than with respect to USD Secured
Notes Tranche 1), including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that
the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such
withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be
less than the amounts that would have been received by such Holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, in respect of
such payments on any such Secured Note or Secured Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or levied but for the existence of any actual or deemed

present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over, the relevant Holder, if such Holder is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or
national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically
present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely
from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or exercise
or enforcements of any rights under such Note, the Secured Indenture or a Secured Note Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the

Secured Note to comply with a written request of the Payor (such request being made at a time that would
enable such Holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request), to provide
certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of
the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other
reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part
of such Tax;


-----

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Secured Note for

payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on the Secured

Notes or any Secured Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other

governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes payable under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the date of this Offering Circular

(or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to
comply with), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered
into pursuant thereto, and any intergovernmental agreements implementing the foregoing (including any
legislation or other official guidance relating to such intergovernmental agreements) (“FATCA”);

(7) any Taxes imposed or withheld solely by reason of the Holder, or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member

or shareholder of the Holder if the Holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation, or a person holding
a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary Holder, being considered as: (i) being or having
been a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company or a controlled foreign
corporation with respect to the United States or a corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United
States federal income tax; (ii) being or having been a “10-percent shareholder” of the Payor as defined in
Section 871(h)(3) of the Code or any successor provision; or (iii) being a bank receiving payments on an
extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or
business; or

(8) any combination of items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or any person other than the beneficial owner of the relevant Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler
with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled
to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant taxing authority of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.

The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld from each relevant taxing authority of each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing
such Taxes and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee and the Paying Agent(s). If, notwithstanding the
efforts of such Payor to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, such Payor will provide the Trustee with
other reasonable evidence of such payments. Such receipts or other evidence will be made available by the Trustee to
Holders on reasonable written request.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Secured Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to
be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the applicable Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts
to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days
prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate and such other
information as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date, and otherwise in
accordance with the requirements of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable). The Trustee and the Paying
Agent(s) will accept, without further inquiry, such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are
necessary.

Wherever in the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes, any Secured Note Guarantee or this “Description of
Secured Notes” there is mention of, in any context:


-----

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Secured Notes or any Secured Note Guarantee;

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to
the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay the Holder for any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise,
property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
delivery, registration or enforcement of any Secured Notes, the Secured Indenture or any other document or instrument
in relation thereto (other than, in each case, in connection with a transfer of any of the Secured Notes after this offering
and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments
of principal or interest on the Secured Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under
clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (6) above), payable due to a registration, submission or filing by a party of any
Secured Notes, the Secured Indenture or any other document or instrument in relation thereto where such registration,
submission or filing is or was not required to maintain or preserve the rights of the party under such documents.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Secured Indenture,
transfer by a Holder or a beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor
to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident
for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Secured Notes
or the Secured Note Guarantee is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein.

**Agreed Tax Treatment**

Although the Secured Notes are co-issued by the Issuer, the LuxCo Co-Issuer and the Allied Co-Issuer and,
therefore, each Issuer is liable for repayment of the Secured Notes in their entirety, for tax purposes the Issuers
agree, and by acquiring an interest in the Secured Notes each beneficial owner of a Secured Note agrees, to treat for
U.S. federal income tax purposes the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 as being issued by the Issuer and the USD
Secured Notes Tranche 2, the Euro Secured Notes and the Sterling Secured Notes as being issued by the LuxCo CoIssuer. The net proceeds of the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 will be received and used by, and all payments due on
such notes are expected to be paid by, the Issuer, whereas the net proceeds of the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2, the
Euro Secured Notes and the Sterling Secured Notes will be received and used by, and all payments due on such
notes are expected to be paid by, the LuxCo Co-Issuer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Issuer or any other Payor
may withhold from any interest payment made on any Secured Note to or for the benefit of any person who is not a
“United States person,” as such term is defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. federal withholding tax
(including any withholding imposed under FATCA), and pay such withheld amounts to the Internal Revenue
Service, unless such person provides documentation to such Issuer or other Payor such that an exemption from U.S.
federal withholding tax (including any withholding imposed under FATCA) would apply to such payment if interest
on such Secured Note were treated entirely as income from sources within the United States for U.S. federal income
tax purposes; provided that the foregoing shall not limit any of the Issuers’ obligations hereunder to pay Additional
Amounts.

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuers are redeeming less than all of any series of Secured Notes issued under the Secured Indenture at
any time, the Trustee or relevant Paying Agent, as applicable, will select the Secured Notes of such series to be
redeemed (1) if the Secured Notes of such series are listed on an exchange, as certified to the Trustee or Paying
Agent, as applicable, by the Issuers, in compliance with the requirements of such exchange or in accordance with


-----

customary DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream procedures, as applicable, or (2) on a pro rata basis to the extent
practicable, or, if the pro rata basis is not practicable for any reason, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee
or Paying Agent, as applicable, deems fair and appropriate in accordance with DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
procedures, as applicable. No USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 or USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 of $200,000 or less
can be redeemed in part. No Euro Secured Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. No Sterling Secured
Notes of £100,000 or less can be redeemed in part.

Notices of purchase or redemption shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 10 days but, except as set forth under “—Optional Redemption,” not more than 60 days before the
purchase or redemption date to each Holder of Secured Notes to be redeemed (with a copy to the Trustee and the
applicable Paying Agent) at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days
prior to a Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Secured Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Secured Indenture. If any Secured Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only,
any notice of purchase or redemption that relates to such Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount
thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed. If the Issuers request the Trustee or the applicable Paying
Agent to give notice of purchase or redemption on its behalf, the Issuers will give written notice to the Trustee and
the applicable Paying Agent at least 5 Business Days prior to the date on which notice of redemption is to be sent (or
such shorter period as agreed by the Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent).

With respect to Secured Notes represented by certificated notes, upon request, the Issuers will issue a new
Secured Note in a principal amount equal to the unpurchased or unredeemed portion of the original Secured Note in
the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Secured Note; provided that (i) new USD Secured Notes
Tranche 1 and new USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 will only be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $200,000, (ii) new Euro Secured Notes will only be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess of €100,000 and (iii) new Sterling Secured
Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess of
£100,000. Subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of any conditions precedent relating thereto, Secured Notes called
for purchase or redemption become due on the date fixed for purchase or redemption. On and after the Redemption
Date, unless the Issuers default in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Secured Notes or
portions of them called for redemption.

If and for so long as any Secured Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the
Authority so require, the Issuers will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders of the Secured Notes
listed on the Exchange and, in connection with any redemption of Secured Notes listed on the Exchange, the Issuers
will notify the Authority of any change in the principal amount of such Secured Notes outstanding.

Except as otherwise required under the Secured Indenture, the Issuers may elect to redeem or repurchase one
or more series of Notes or a portion of a series of Notes without redeeming any other series of Notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**Change of Control**

The Secured Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuers have previously or
substantially concurrently therewith electronically delivered or mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the
outstanding Secured Notes as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will make an offer
to purchase all of the Secured Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price
in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase (provided that if the
repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders
in whose names the Secured Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on
the repurchase date). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will send notice of such Change
of Control Offer by electronic delivery in accordance with the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, or first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent, to each Holder of Secured


-----

Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant, and that all Secured Notes
properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuers;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days
from the date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered (the “Change of Control Payment Date”),
subject to extension (in the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the
occurrence of the Change of Control) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of Control is
delayed;

(3) that any Secured Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Secured Notes
accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the
Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Secured Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will
be required to surrender such Secured Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect
Purchase” on the reverse of such Secured Notes completed, to the applicable Paying Agent specified in
the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day
preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Secured Notes and their election to require the
Issuers to purchase such Secured Notes; provided that the applicable Paying Agent receives, not later
than the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of
Control Offer, a facsimile transmission, electronic transmission or letter (or otherwise compliance with
the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable) setting forth the name of the Holder of
the Secured Notes, the principal amount of Secured Notes tendered for purchase and a statement that
such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Secured Notes and its election to have such Secured Notes
purchased;

(7) that Holders whose Secured Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Secured Notes
and such new Secured Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the
Secured Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 and the USD
Secured Notes Tranche 2 must be equal to at least $200,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess
thereof, the unpurchased portion of the Euro Secured Notes must be equal to at least €100,000 or any
integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof and the unpurchased portion of the Sterling Secured Notes
must be equal to at least £100,000 or any integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof;

(8) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and describing each such
condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date
may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of such Change of
Control was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions are
satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion), or such purchase may not occur and such
notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions are not satisfied (or waived by the
Issuers in their sole discretion) by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control
Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuers’ discretion if in
the good faith judgment of the Issuers any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied. In addition, the
Issuers may provide in such notice that payment of the purchase price and performance of the Issuers’
obligations with respect to such Change of Control Offer may be performed by another Person; and

(9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with the covenant described hereunder,
that a Holder must follow in order to have its Secured Notes repurchased.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the


-----

repurchase of Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Secured Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that
the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Secured Notes issued by them or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer,

(2) deposit with the applicable Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment
in respect of all Secured Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee or the applicable Registrar for cancellation the Secured
Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Secured Notes
or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Secured Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Secured Notes in the event of
a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes
provide, the Unsecured Notes will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of
control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control or a
change of control under the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured
Notes). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other
indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or such other
indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or such other
indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other
indebtedness being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may
be limited by our then-existing financial resources and sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to finance a
change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more
difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of
Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present
intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that
we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into
certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Secured Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at
such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the
Secured Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Secured
Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Secured Notes protection in
the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to a series of Secured Notes
following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Secured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Secured Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn under


-----

such Change of Control Offer, (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Secured Notes of such series has been
given pursuant to the Secured Indenture as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until
there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable Redemption Date or the redemption is not
consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be
satisfied or (iii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuers (or any Affiliate of the
Issuers) have made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Secured Notes of such series validly
tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and have purchased all Secured
Notes of such series properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change
of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting
the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of
Secured Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Secured Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligations to make an offer to repurchase
the Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of Change of Control, may be waived
or modified (at any time, including after a Change of Control) with the written consent of the Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Secured Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the
Authority so require, the Issuers will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

**Asset Sales**

The Secured Indenture will provide that from and after the Issue Date, the Issuer will not, and will not permit
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise)
at least equal to the fair market value (at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), as
determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the assets subject to such Asset Sale; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, if the property or assets sold or otherwise disposed have a
fair market value in excess of the greater of $980.0 million and 50.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of
the consideration from such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a
cumulative basis) (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for,
any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that each of the following will be deemed
to be cash or Cash Equivalents for purposes of this clause (2):

(a) any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than
liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in right of payment to the Secured Notes that (x) are
assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer) or
(y) are otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction with such transferee
(other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries) and, in each case,
for which the Issuer and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been released;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee or in connection with such Asset Sale (including earnouts and
similar obligations) that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or
Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received) or by their terms are


-----

required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of
such Asset Sale;

(c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Sale (other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary),
to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee
of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

(d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuers (other than intercompany debt owed to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the
Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(e) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, as determined by the Issuer in good faith,
taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause
(e) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $590.0 million and 30.0% of LTM
EBITDA at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with the fair
market value of each such item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured pursuant
to this clause (e) at the Issuer’s option, either at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset
Sale or at the time received and, in either case, without giving effect to subsequent changes in
value); and

(f) any Investment, Capital Stock, assets, property or capital or other expenditure of the kind referred
to in clause (2) of the second paragraph in this “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales.”

Within 540 days after the later of (i) the date of such Asset Sale and (ii) receipt of any Net Proceeds of any
Asset Sale (as may be extended by an Acceptable Commitment or a Second Commitment as set forth below, the
“Proceeds Application Period”), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal
to the Applicable Percentage of such Net Proceeds (the “Available Proceeds”) from such Asset Sale:

(1) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase:

(a) to the extent such Available Proceeds are from an Asset Sale of Notes Collateral, Obligations with
Pari Passu Lien Priority (including the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing 2026 Secured
Notes) or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, and, in the case of revolving
obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; provided that, to the
extent any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary will so repay any such Indebtedness (other than the
Secured Notes), the Issuer will reduce Obligations under the Secured Notes on a pro rata basis by,
at its option, (i) redeeming Secured Notes as provided under the caption “—Optional
Redemption,” (ii) purchasing Secured Notes through open-market purchases or (iii) by making an
offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth herein for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to
purchase their Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to or higher than 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
on the principal amount of the Secured Notes to be repurchased to the date of repurchase;

(b) to the extent such Available Proceeds resulted from an Asset Sale not consisting of Collateral,
Obligations in respect of other Secured Indebtedness (including the Secured Notes), and, in the
case of revolving commitments, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(c) Obligations in respect of the Secured Notes or any other Indebtedness (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of revolving
commitments, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided that, to the
extent any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary will so repay any such Indebtedness (other than the
Secured Notes), the Issuer will reduce Obligations under the Secured Notes on a pro rata basis by,
at its option, (i) redeeming Secured Notes as provided under the caption “—Optional
Redemption,” (ii) purchasing Secured Notes through open-market purchases or (iii) by making an
offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth herein for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to
purchase their Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to or higher than 100% of the principal


-----

amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
on the principal amount of the Secured Notes to be repurchased to the date of repurchase; or

(d) Obligations in respect of Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, in the case of clause (c) above, (i) if an offer to purchase any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any_
Restricted Subsidiary is made, such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the amount of such
offer, whether or not accepted by the holders of such Indebtedness, and no Available Proceeds in the
amount of such offer will be deemed to exist following such offer, and (ii) if the holder of any
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer declines the repayment of such Indebtedness owed
to it from such Available Proceeds, such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the declined
Available Proceeds; or

(2) (i) to invest (including capital expenditures) in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by
means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary); or (ii) to invest (including
capital expenditures) in any one or more businesses, properties or assets that replace the businesses,
properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale, with any such investment made by way
of a capital or other lease valued at the present value of the minimum amount of payments under such
lease (as reasonably determined by the Issuer); provided that, in the case of this clause (2), a binding
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Available Proceeds from the date of such
commitment so long as the Issuer or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or
intent with the good faith expectation that such Available Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such
commitment within 180 days of such commitment (or, if later, 540 days after the receipt of such
Available Proceeds) (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is
later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Available Proceeds are applied in connection
therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a
“Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination (or, if later, 540 days after
the receipt of such Available Proceeds); provided further that if any Second Commitment is later
cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Available Proceeds are applied, then such Available
Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds on the date of such cancellation or termination; or

(3) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that (1) pending the final application of the amount of any such Available Proceeds pursuant to_
this covenant, the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiaries may apply such Available Proceeds
temporarily to reduce Indebtedness (including under the Credit Facilities) or otherwise apply such
Available Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Secured Indenture, and (2) the Issuer (or any
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the
Available Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale (provided that such investment shall be made no
earlier than execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Sale, and consummation of the
relevant Asset Sale) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with
clause (b) above with respect to such Asset Sale.

To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds or Available Proceeds payable in respect of the USD Secured
Notes Tranche 1 or the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, the amount
thereof payable in respect of the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 or the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 shall not
exceed the net amount of funds in Dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into
Dollars. To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds or Available Proceeds payable in respect of the Euro Secured
Notes is denominated in a currency other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Euro Secured
Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euros that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such
portion into Euros. To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds or Available Proceeds payable in respect of the
Sterling Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than Sterling, the amount thereof payable in respect of the
Sterling Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Sterling that is actually received by the Issuer
upon converting such portion into Sterling.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Available
Proceeds of any Asset Sale received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is


-----

(x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any
agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated under
applicable local law, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be
applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts shall not be so applied so long, but only so long, as the
applicable local law, documents or agreements will not permit repatriation (the Issuer hereby agrees to use
reasonable efforts (as determined in the Issuer’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable
Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have
been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational
impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which
the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds
is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other impediment, an amount
equal to such Net Proceeds (net of additional Taxes that would be payable or reserved against as a result of such
repatriation but only to the extent such Taxes do not reduce Net Proceeds pursuant to the definition thereof) will be
promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied in
compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of
any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse Tax consequence (which for the
avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment out of such Net Proceeds whereby doing so the
Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries, any Parent Entity or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would
incur a Tax liability, including a Tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding
Tax), an amount equal to the Net Proceeds so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The
non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance
of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

When the Available Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the
time period set forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such Available Proceeds
used to make an offer to purchase Secured Notes as described in clause (1)(a) or (1)(c) above, will be deemed to
have been so applied whether or not such offer is accepted) exceeds the greater of $780.0 million and 40.0% of
LTM EBITDA (such amount of Available Proceeds that are less than or equal to the greater of $780.0 million and
40.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Declined Excess Proceeds,” and such amount of Available Proceeds that are in excess of
the greater of $780.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with
respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth above, the Issuers will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders
of the Secured Notes and, at the option of the Issuers, to any holders of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the
maximum aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is, (i) in the case
of the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 and the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2, in an amount equal to at least
$200,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, (ii) in the case of the Euro Secured Notes, in an amount
equal to at least €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof and (iii) in the case of the Sterling
Secured Notes, in an amount equal to at least £100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof, in each
case, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Secured Notes of the
applicable series, in cash in an amount equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if
less), plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the
closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Secured Indenture (and, in respect of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness, such other price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness). The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 30 days after
the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period by delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of the
Secured Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent. The Issuers may, at their option,
satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Available Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale
Offer with respect to such Available Proceeds prior to the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period (the
“Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the Available Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being
required to do so by the Secured Indenture or with respect to any Declined Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Secured Notes and such
Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or in the case of
an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of
an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in Declined Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Excess Proceeds for
any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Secured Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value,
as applicable) of Secured Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the


-----

amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall select the
Secured Notes (while the Secured Notes are in global form pursuant to the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the
accreted value or aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered;
_provided that no Secured Notes will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion_
of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Available Proceeds and Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance
Offer, the Advance Portion) will be reset to zero. An Asset Sale Offer may be made at the same time as consents are
solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Secured Indenture, Secured Notes and/or
Secured Note Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Secured Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Secured
Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff
of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

The provisions under the Secured Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligations to make an offer to repurchase
the Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding.

The Senior Credit Facilities may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which
the Issuers become parties may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Secured Notes pursuant to this
covenant. In the event the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Secured Notes, the Issuers could seek the
consent of their lenders to the purchase of the Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that
contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuers will remain
prohibited from purchasing the Secured Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Secured Notes
would constitute an Event of Default under the Secured Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Secured Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below under “—
Certain Covenants.”

**Covenant Suspension**

If on any date following the Issue Date (i) a series of Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Ratings
from two Rating Agencies (“Investment Grade Status”) and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the
Secured Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively
referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the
following covenants (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “Repurchase at the Option of Holders”;

(2) “Asset Sales”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(4) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

(5) clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”;

(6) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(7) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and


-----

(8) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.”

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under
the Secured Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion
_Date”) the relevant series of Secured Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Issuer and its_
Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Secured Indenture
with respect to future events unless and until the relevant series of Secured Notes subsequently attain Investment
Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the relevant
series of Secured Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status).

The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred
to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension
Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Available Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken
by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or events occurring prior to such reinstatement, or any actions taken at any
time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, will give rise to a Default, Event of
Default or breach of any kind under the Secured Indenture, any series of Secured Notes or the Secured Note
Guarantees nor shall the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries bear any liability for such actions or events. With respect to
Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments
will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had
been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the
Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph
of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” All Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified as having been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3)(b)(i)
of the second paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion
Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant
to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Transactions with Affiliates.”
Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Non-Guarantor to take any action described in clauses
(1) through (3) of the covenant described under the caption “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted
pursuant to clause (a) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Dividend and Other
Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during
the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (7) of such definition. No Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on
Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee
entered into by such Restricted Subsidiary during any Suspension Period except that such Restricted Subsidiary shall
execute and deliver a supplemental indenture to the Secured Indenture providing for a Secured Note Guarantee by
such Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to the provisions of such covenant to the extent required and to the extent such
Restricted Subsidiary has not already provided a Secured Note Guarantee.

On and after each Reversion Date, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the
transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and
such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

The Secured Notes of any series may never achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of any series of Secured Notes, determine whether a
Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date has occurred or notify Holders of the same.

**Limitation on Restricted Payments**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:


-----

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuer’s, or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in connection
with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation other than:

(a) dividends, payments or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of
the Issuer or a Parent Entity or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Stock);

(b) dividends, payments or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any
dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities
issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Issuer, the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend, payment or
distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities; provided
that the Giants Ultimate Parent may not declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or
distribution on account of its Equity Interests in reliance on this clause (b) unless the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries receive 100% of such dividend or distribution; or

(c) dividends or distributions payable to any Parent Entity to fund interest payments in respect of
Indebtedness of such Parent Entity which is guaranteed by the Issuers or any Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that the net proceeds of such Indebtedness of such Parent Entity shall be
contributed to the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer or
any Parent Entity, including in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation, in each case
held by Persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value,

in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated
Indebtedness, other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7), (8) and (9) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; or

(b) prepayments, redemptions, repurchases, defeasance and other payments, acquisitions or
retirements in respect of Subordinated Indebtedness prior to their scheduled maturity purchased in
anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each
case, due within one year of the date of such prepayment, redemption, purchase, repurchase,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement;

(IV) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) (other than any exception thereto) above
being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:

(1) other than in the case of a Restricted Investment, immediately after giving effect to such Restricted
Payment on a pro forma basis, (i) the Issuer could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or (ii) the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio
would have been no greater than 6.50 to 1:00; and

(2) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made
(and not returned or rescinded) by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after July 12, 2019 (and
including Restricted Payments permitted by clause (1) (without duplication) of the next succeeding
paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is
less than the sum of (without duplication):

(a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period)
beginning on July 1, 2019 to the end of the Issuer’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which


-----

internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case
such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit (which
amount shall not be less than zero); plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by
the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property received by the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries after July 12, 2019 or that becomes part of the capital of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary through consolidation, amalgamation or merger following July 12, 2019 (other than net
cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness or issue
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of the
covenant under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”) from the issue or sale of:

excluding cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the

members of management, distributors or consultants (or their respective Controlled
Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Issuer or any Parent
Entity after July 12, 2019 to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted
Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph; and

(y) Designated Preferred Stock; and

(B) to the extent such net cash proceeds or other property are actually contributed to the
capital of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (without the issuance of additional
Equity Interests of such Restricted Subsidiary), Equity Interests of any Parent Entity
(excluding Contributed Holdings Investments (as defined below) and contributions
of the proceeds from the sale of Designated Preferred Stock of such companies or
contributions to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments
made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph); or

(ii) debt securities of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that have been converted into or
exchanged for such Equity Interests of the Issuer or any Parent Entity;

_provided, however, that this clause (b) shall not include the proceeds from (W) Refunding_
Capital Stock (as defined below) applied in accordance with clause (2) of the next succeeding
paragraph, (X) Equity Interests or convertible debt securities of the Issuer sold to a Restricted
Subsidiary, (Y) Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified

constitute Restricted Investments made by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each
case after July 12, 2019; or

(ii) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the
Equity Interests of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a distribution from an Unrestricted
Subsidiary (other than, in each case, to the extent of the amount of the Investment in such

clause (11) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent of the amount of such
Investment that constituted a Permitted Investment and will increase the amount available
under clause (11) of the next succeeding paragraph or the applicable clause of the
definition of “Permitted Investment,” as the case may be) or a dividend from an
Unrestricted Subsidiary after July 12, 2019; plus

(e) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or the
merger, amalgamation or consolidation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary into the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary after July 12, 2019, the fair market value of
the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary (or the assets transferred), as determined in good
faith by the Issuer at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted

transfer of assets (after taking into consideration any Indebtedness associated with the
Unrestricted Subsidiary so designated or merged, amalgamated or consolidated or Indebtedness
associated with the assets so transferred), other than to the extent of the amount of the
Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
pursuant to clause (11) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent of the amount of such
Investment that constituted a Permitted Investment made after July 12, 2019 and will increase
the amount available under clause (11) of the next succeeding paragraph or the applicable clause
of the definition of “Permitted Investment,” as the case may be; plus

(f) the greater of $980.0 million and 50.0% of LTM EBITDA.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) the payment of any dividend or other distribution or the consummation of any redemption, repurchase or
retirement within 60 days after the date of declaration of such dividend or other distribution or giving of
the redemption notice with respect to such redemption, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration
or notice, the payment of such dividend or other distribution or in respect of such redemption,
repurchase or retirement, as the case may be, would have complied with the provisions of the Secured
Indenture;

(2) (a) the prepayment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, discharge, retirement or other

substantially concurrent sale (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of, Equity Interests of
the Issuer or any Parent Entity to the extent contributed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (in

Capital Stock (other than Refunding Capital Stock the proceeds of which were used to redeem,
repurchase, retire or otherwise acquire any Equity Interests of any Parent Entity) in an aggregate amount
per year no greater than the aggregate amount of dividends per annum that were declarable and payable

retirements of Subordinated Indebtedness made pursuant to this clause (25), not to exceed the greater of
$590.0 million and 30.0% of LTM EBITDA at such time, and (ii) the redemption, defeasance,
repurchase, exchange or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuers or
any Guarantor, so long as, immediately after giving pro forma effect to the payment of any such
Restricted Payment and the incurrence of any Indebtedness the net proceeds of which are used to make
such Restricted Payment, the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio shall be no greater than 5.50 to 1.00.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment
or Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of clauses (1) through (25) above or is
entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the
definition of “Permitted Investments,” the Issuer will be entitled to divide, classify and subsequently divide and
reclassify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through (25) and
such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in a
manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property
or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating to an Investment, the Issuer
or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Investment as having occurred on the date of the
commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating thereto (such date, the “Election Date”) if, after giving
_pro forma effect to such Investment and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related pro forma_
adjustments, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment on
the relevant Election Date in compliance with the Secured Indenture, and any related subsequent actual making of
such Investment will be deemed for all purposes under the Secured Indenture to have been made on such Election
Date, including for purposes of calculating any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if
applicable) and EBITDA or LTM EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or
Event of Default (and all such calculations on and after the Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing,
rescission, retraction or rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement or similar event shall be made on a
pro forma basis giving effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith).

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity
or any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer
will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries.

If the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such
Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the provisions of the
Secured Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Secured
Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Issuer’s financial statements
affecting Consolidated Net Income or EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Issuer for any period.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of, or dividends or other distributions in
amounts sufficient to make, any “AHYDO catch-up payment” with respect to any Indebtedness of any Parent Entity,
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the Secured Indenture.

consolidated with the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Secured
Indenture, equal to or less than it was immediately prior to such acquisition or merger, in each case as of
the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred, determined on a pro forma basis (including
a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom but without giving effect to any simultaneous
incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to clause 1(b)); provided that for the purposes of determining the

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof)
at any time, whether at the time of incurrence or upon the application of all or a portion of the proceeds
thereof or subsequently, meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness,

Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) and will only be required to include the amount and type of
such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or a portion thereof) in one of the above
clauses or under the first paragraph of this covenant (it being understood that any Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant shall cease to be deemed
incurred or outstanding for purposes of such clause but shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the


-----

first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries could have incurred such Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant); provided
that all Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facilities on the Issue Date will be treated as incurred
on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the preceding paragraph and may not be reclassified;

(2) at the time of incurrence or reclassification, the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify or re-divide
or reclassify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first
and second paragraphs above;

(3) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
Credit Facility, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and
including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) shall be
determined on the date of such Credit Facility or such increase in commitments (assuming that the full
amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, test is
satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance
and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) shall be permitted under this
covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or
the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing
thereunder (or the issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the
committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of
credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this paragraph shall be the
“Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the

(4) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary incurs Indebtedness in connection with any
Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions,
Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the
incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Sales) in accordance with
the terms of the Secured Indenture, when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the
Secured Indenture or compliance with any provision of the Secured Indenture, at the option of the Issuer
(the Issuer’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for
availability under any such basket or ratio, including the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, and
whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is
complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default))
under the Secured Indenture will, at the option of the Issuer, be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test
_Date”) either (a) that a definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or if_
applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event) or
(b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the City Code applies, the date on which a “Rule
2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent announcement in another
jurisdiction) (an “LCT Public Offer”) in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction and, in
each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption
of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments,
Restricted Payments and Asset Sales) and any related pro forma adjustments, the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such
transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related
requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions)
shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness,
for example, whether such Indebtedness is committed, issued, assumed or incurred at the LCT Test Date
or at any time thereafter); provided that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal
quarters shall have become available, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such
ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of
redetermination shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or


-----

baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or
baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after
the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction
related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted
Payments and Asset Sales) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as reasonably determined by the Issuer.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets,
including the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Debt Ratio, as applicable, after giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments
and Asset Sales) and any related pro forma adjustments (A) if any such ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance
was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or
otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such ratio, test or basket (including due to
fluctuations in the EBITDA or Total Assets of the Issuer or the Person subject to such Limited Condition
Transaction), such ratios, tests or baskets will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied
with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of
any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the
LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to
the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be
deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed
not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in
connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant
LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or
the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable
notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable
notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such
acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such
ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction;

(5) accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP will not be deemed to be an incurrence
or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant;

(6) for purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided
that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency,
and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollardenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of
such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(7) the principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a
different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is
in effect on the date of such refinancing;

(8) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, the amount of Indebtedness being incurred to finance the
aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, dividends, premiums
(including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses


-----

(including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing will
not be deemed to be an incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant;

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant, measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based
on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA
restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums),
defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, costs, fees and expenses (including original issue discount,
upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing;

(10) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar

instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the termination of a
particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(11) the Secured Indenture will not treat (x) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured

Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (y) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any
other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is
secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors;

(12) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are

incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of the
second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(13) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred

Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(14) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision

permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and

(15) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal

to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

**Liens**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit the Co-Issuers or any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,
assume or permit to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, an “Initial Lien”) that secures Obligations under
any Indebtedness or any related Guarantee, on any asset or property of the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or any Guarantor,
unless:

(1) in the case of Initial Liens on any Collateral, (i) such Initial Lien expressly has Junior Lien Priority on
the Collateral relative to the Secured Notes and related Secured Note Guarantees or (ii) such Lien is a
Permitted Lien; or


-----

(2) in the case of any Initial Lien on any asset or property that is not Collateral, (i) the Secured Notes or the
Secured Note Guarantees are equally and ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case such
Initial Lien secured any Subordinated Indebtedness) the Obligations secured by such Initial Lien until
such time as such Obligations are no longer secured by such Initial Lien or (ii) such Initial Lien is a
Permitted Lien,

except that the foregoing shall not apply to Liens securing the Secured Notes and the related Secured Note
Guarantees.

Any Lien created for the benefit of Holders of the Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant shall provide by its
terms that such Lien will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of
the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into, or sell, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all
its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving Person or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
_Company”) will be a Person organized or existing under the laws of the United Kingdom, a European_
Union member state, the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or the United States, any state thereof,
the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof, Canada, Norway, Switzerland or Japan, and the
Successor Company, if other than the Issuer, will expressly assume all the obligations of the Issuer
under the Secured Notes, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements pursuant to
supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing;

(3) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, either

(a) the applicable Successor Company or the Issuer would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under the
caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and

with the Secured Indenture; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (2) and (3) above;
and

(5) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged or consolidated with or into the Issuer are assets
of the type which would constitute Collateral under the Collateral Documents, the Issuer or the


-----

Successor Company, as applicable, will take such action, if any, as may be reasonably necessary to
cause such assets to be made subject to the Lien of the applicable Collateral Documents in the manner
and to the extent required in the Secured Indenture or the applicable Collateral Documents and shall
take all reasonably necessary action so that such Lien is perfected to the extent required by the
applicable Collateral Documents.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Issuer under the Secured Indenture, the Collateral Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Secured
Notes, and the Issuer will automatically and unconditionally be released and discharged from its obligations
thereunder.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of this section) shall not apply to the
creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

Any reference in the Secured Indenture to a merger, consolidation, conveyance, disposal, assignment, sale or
disposition or similar term, shall be deemed to apply to a division of or by a limited liability company, corporation
or partnership, or an allocation of assets to a series of or one or more limited liability companies, partnerships or
corporations, or the unwinding of such a division or allocation, as if it were a merger, consolidation, conveyance,
disposal, assignment, sale or disposition, or similar term, as applicable, to, of or with a separate Person. Any division
of a limited liability company, corporation or partnership shall be deemed to constitute the formation of a separate
Person, and any such division shall constitute a separate Person under the Indenture (and each division of any
limited liability company, corporation or partnership that is a subsidiary, joint venture or any other like term shall
also constitute such a Person or entity).

**_The Co-Issuers_**

Each of the LuxCo Co-Issuer and the Allied Co-Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into, or sell,
transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to
any Person, unless:

(1) concurrently therewith, a Wholly Owned Subsidiary (or in the case of the Allied Co-Issuer, a corporate
Wholly Owned Subsidiary) that is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer organized or existing under the
laws of the United Kingdom, a European Union member state, the respective jurisdiction of
organization of the LuxCo Co-Issuer or the Allied Co-Issuer, as applicable, or the United States, any
state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof, Canada, Norway, Switzerland or Japan,
is the Successor Company and the Successor Company, if other than the LuxCo Co-Issuer or the Allied
Co-Issuer, as applicable, expressly assumes all the obligations of the LuxCo Co-Issuer or the Allied CoIssuer, as applicable, under the Secured Notes, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreements pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments, and if such
Successor Company is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Secured Notes is a corporation organized or
existing under such laws;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing;

(3) the LuxCo Co-Issuer or the Allied Co-Issuer, as applicable, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer
and such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Secured Indenture; provided that in giving an
Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as
to satisfaction of clause (2) above; and

(4) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged or consolidated with or into the LuxCo Co-Issuer
or the Allied Co-Issuer, as applicable, are assets of the type which would constitute Collateral under the
Collateral Documents, the LuxCo Co-Issuer, the Allied Co-Issuer or the Successor Company, as

subject to the Lien of the applicable Collateral Documents in the manner and to the extent required in
the Secured Indenture or the applicable Collateral Documents and shall take all reasonably necessary
action so that such Lien is perfected to the extent required by the applicable Collateral Documents.

**_The Guarantors_**

Subject to certain limitations described in the Secured Indenture governing release of a Secured Note
Guarantee upon the sale, disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor may consolidate or merge with or into,
or sell, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of its assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person
(other than the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or a Guarantor), unless:

(1) (a) the other Person is the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor concurrently with the transaction; or either (x) the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or a
Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes
all the obligations of the Guarantor under its Secured Note Guarantee and the Secured Indenture;
(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing; and (c) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged or consolidated with or into
such Guarantor are assets of the type which would constitute Collateral under the Collateral Documents,
such Guarantor or the Successor Company, as applicable, will take such action, if any, as may be
reasonably necessary to cause such assets to be made subject to the Lien of the applicable Collateral
Documents in the manner and to the extent required in the Secured Indenture or the applicable
Collateral Documents and shall take all reasonably necessary action so that such Lien is perfected to the
extent required by the applicable Collateral Documents; or

(2) with respect to the Guarantors, the transaction is not prohibited by the first paragraph of the covenant
described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be
substituted for, such Guarantor under the Secured Indenture and such Guarantor’s Secured Note Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,

(1) the Issuer or the Co-Issuers may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or
part of their property or assets to the Co-Issuers (if they are not such entities) or a Guarantor;

(2) the Issuer or the Co-Issuers may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate of the
Issuer for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer or the Co-Issuers in another jurisdiction, or changing
the legal form of the Issuer or the Co-Issuers;

(3) any Guarantor may (i) consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or another Guarantor (or to a Restricted Subsidiary if
that Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor), (ii) consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge
into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Guarantor in another jurisdiction of
organization or changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor, (iii) convert into a corporation,
partnership, limited partnership, limited liability corporation or trust organized or existing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, (iv) consolidate or amalgamate with or merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary that is neither a
Guarantor nor a Co-Issuer so long as (A) to the extent constituting an Investment, such Investment is
otherwise permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” or (B) to the extent constituting an Asset Sale, such Asset Sale is for fair market value (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer) and any promissory note or other non-cash consideration
received in respect thereof is a permitted Investment in a Restricted Subsidiary that is neither a
Guarantor nor a Co-Issuer in accordance with the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation
on Restricted Payments,” or (v) liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if the Issuer determines in
good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Issuer;

(4) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuers or a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise
combine with or merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer, the Co-Issuers
(if they are not such Restricted Subsidiaries) or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may consummate any Permitted Tax Restructuring; and

(6) the Transactions will be permitted without compliance with this “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All
or Substantially All Assets” covenant.


-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

A sale, lease or other disposition by the Issuer of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the
sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Secured Indenture if the fair
market value of the assets retained by the Issuer exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
Secured Notes and any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Issuer that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Secured
Notes with respect to such assets. Such fair market value shall be established by the delivery to the Trustee of an
independent expert’s certificate stating the independent expert’s opinion of such fair market value as of a date not
more than 90 days before or after such sale, lease or other disposition. This paragraph is not intended to limit the
Issuer’s sales, leases or other dispositions of less than substantially all of its assets.

**Transactions With Affiliates**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into or conduct any
transaction with any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
payments or consideration in excess of the greater of $200.0 million and 10.0% of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for
such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of $295.0
million and 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of
the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of
this paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of
the Issuer, if any.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) transactions between or among the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary and/or any entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction, or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries and
(b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity; provided that such Parent Entity
shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital
Stock of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise permitted under the
Secured Indenture;

(2) Restricted Payments or other transactions permitted to be made or undertaken by the provisions of the
Secured Indenture described above under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (including
Permitted Payments) and the definition of “Permitted Investments”;

other fees, costs and expenses to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly), including to its
affiliates or its designees, pursuant to any management services or similar agreements or the
management services or other relevant provisions in an investor rights agreement, limited partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement or other equityholders’ agreement, as the case may be,
as in effect from time to time (plus any unpaid management, consulting, monitoring, refinancing,
transaction, advisory, indemnities and other fees, costs and expenses accrued in any prior year) and any
exit and termination fees (including any such cash lump sum or present value fee upon the
consummation of a corporate event, including an initial public offering) pursuant to such agreement, in
each case as in effect on the Issue Date or any amendment thereto or replacement thereof (so long as any
such amendment or replacement is not materially disadvantageous, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Issuer, to the Holders when taken as a whole as compared to the management
services or similar agreements in effect immediately prior to such amendment or replacement);


-----

(4) the payment of fees, costs, compensation and expenses paid to, and indemnities (including under
insurance policies) and reimbursements, employment and severance arrangements and employee benefit
and pension expenses provided on behalf of, or for the benefit of, future, current or former directors,
employees, officers, managers, contractors, distributors, advisors or consultants (or their respective
Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Issuer, any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or any Parent Entity (whether directly or indirectly and including through their Controlled
Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members);

(5) transactions in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view meet the requirements of clause (1) of the
preceding paragraph;

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the
terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any

supplement, extension, renewal, refinancing or replacement thereof in accordance with the other terms
of this covenant or so long as any such amendment, modification, supplement, extension, renewal,
refinancing or replacement is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders when taken as
a whole as compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the Issue Date and performance of
obligations thereunder;

(7) the existence of, or the performance, by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations
under the terms of, any equityholders, investor rights or similar agreement (including any registration
rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to which it is a party as of the Issue Date and
any similar agreements which it (or any Parent Entity) may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that
the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or any Parent
Entity) of obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar
agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that
the terms of any such existing agreement together with all amendments thereto are not otherwise more
disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders when taken as a whole than those in effect on the
Issue Date;

(8) transactions with customers, vendors, clients, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, distributors
or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice or industry practice, and which are fair to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in

reason of an agreement that such Subsidiary is a party to or entered into before the date on which
such Subsidiary became a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such agreement was not entered
into in anticipation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and any such
encumbrance or restriction does not extend to any assets or property of the Issuer or any other
Restricted Subsidiary other than the assets and property of such Subsidiary;

(t) any encumbrance or restriction contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security
agreements permitted under the Secured Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Secured Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or
restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements;

(u) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(v) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Liens”; and

(w) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above imposed
by any amendments, extensions, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to
in clauses (a) through (v) above; provided that such amendments, extensions, modifications,
restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in
the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders
with respect to such encumbrance and other restrictions taken as a whole than those prior to such
amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or
refinancing.

**Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Issuer will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries, and, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, Foreign Subsidiaries organized in Luxembourg and the United Kingdom, in each case, that are
Restricted Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned Domestic
Subsidiaries guarantee other capital markets debt securities of the Issuer in a principal amount in excess of the
greater of $200.0 million and 10.0% of LTM EBITDA), other than the Co-Issuers, a Guarantor, a Receivables
Subsidiary or a Foreign Subsidiary that is not organized in Luxembourg or the United Kingdom, to guarantee the
payment of (i) any syndicated Credit Facility permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock” or (ii) capital markets debt securities of the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or any other Guarantor, in each
case, unless such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the
Secured Indenture providing for a Secured Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to
a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or any Guarantor (x) if the Secured Notes are subordinated
in right of payment to such Indebtedness, the Secured Note Guarantee under the supplemental indenture shall be
subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee with respect to such Indebtedness substantially to the same
extent as the Secured Notes are subordinated to such Indebtedness and (y) if such Indebtedness is by its express
terms subordinated in right of payment to the Secured Notes or such Guarantor’s Secured Note Guarantee, any such
guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment
to such Secured Note Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Secured
Notes or such Guarantor’s Secured Note Guarantee; provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to (i) any
guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was
not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary,
(ii) guarantees of any Receivables Facility by any Receivables Subsidiary and (iii) in the event that the Secured Note
Guarantee of the Issuers’ obligations under the Secured Notes or the Secured Indenture by such Subsidiary would
not be permitted under applicable law or regulatory authority. The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause or
allow, as the case may be, any Subsidiary or any of its Parent Entities that is not otherwise required to be a
Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary or Parent Entity shall not be required to comply
with the 60 day period described above and such Secured Note Guarantee may be released at any time in the Issuer’s
sole discretion so long as any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary or Parent Entity then outstanding could have been
incurred by such Subsidiary or Parent Entity (either (x) when so incurred or (y) at the time of the release of such
Secured Note Guarantee) assuming such Subsidiary or Parent Entity were not a Guarantor at such time.

Each Person that becomes a Guarantor after the Issue Date shall also become a party to the applicable
Collateral Documents and Intercreditor Agreements (as applicable) and shall as promptly as practicable execute and
deliver such security instruments, financing statements, mortgages, deeds of trust and other related real estate
deliverables (in substantially the same form as those executed and delivered with respect to the Collateral on the
Issue Date or on the date first delivered in the case of Collateral that the Secured Indenture provides may be
delivered after the Issue Date (to the extent, and substantially in the form, delivered on the Issue Date or the date
first delivered, as applicable (but no greater scope)) as may be necessary to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a
perfected first-priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in properties and assets that constitute Notes
Collateral and a perfected second-priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in properties and assets that
constitute ABL Collateral, in either case, as security for such Guarantor’s Secured Note Guarantee and as may be
necessary to have such property or asset added to the Collateral as required under the Collateral Documents and the
Secured Indenture, and thereupon all provisions of the Secured Indenture relating to the Collateral shall be deemed
to relate to such properties and assets to the same extent and with the same force and effect.

If any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, the Issuer shall have the right, by delivery of a
supplemental indenture executed by the Issuer to the Trustee, to cause such Immaterial Subsidiary to automatically
and unconditionally cease to be a Guarantor, subject to the requirement described in the first paragraph above that
such Subsidiary shall be required to become a Guarantor if it ceases to be an Immaterial Subsidiary (except that if
such Subsidiary has been properly designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary it shall not be so required to become a
Guarantor or execute a supplemental indenture); provided, further, that such Immaterial Subsidiary shall not be
permitted to Guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities, the Unsecured Notes, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the
Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes or other Indebtedness of the Issuers or the other Guarantors, unless it again becomes
a Guarantor.


-----

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Secured Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent
the Secured Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference
under applicable law, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of
foreign or state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to avoid the notes offered hereby and the
guarantees, and the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in
respect of the notes offered hereby, the guarantees and the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the
related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes offered hereby to return payments received from us in respect
of the guarantees and the liens in respect of the secured notes offered hereby and, if that occurs, you may not receive
any payments on the notes offered hereby” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”

**Reports**

The Secured Indenture will provide that so long as any Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer shall deliver
to the Trustee, within 15 days after the time periods specified below:

is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) (or, in the case of financial statements for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, on or before the date that is 150 days after the end of such
fiscal year (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day)), the financial
statements of the Issuer for such year prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with a report thereon
by the Issuer’s independent auditors, and a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to such financial statements substantially in the form
which would be included in an Annual Report on Form 10-K (as in effect on the Issue Date) filed with

exceptions consistent with the presentation of information in the Offering Circular;

(ii) within 60 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer (or if
such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) (or, in the case of financial

June 30, 2022, on or before the date that is 90 days after the end of such fiscal quarter (or if such day is
not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day)), beginning with the first such fiscal quarter
ending after the Issue Date, the financial statements of the Issuer for such quarter prepared in
accordance with GAAP, together with a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to such financial statements substantially in the form
which would be included in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (as in effect on the Issue Date) filed with
the SEC by the Issuer (if the Issuer were required to prepare and file such form) but subject to
exceptions consistent with the presentation of information in the Offering Circular; and

(iii) promptly (and not required to be sooner than the filing deadlines applied to a Current Report on Form 8
K (as in effect on the Issue Date)) after the occurrence of any of the following events, information
substantially in the form of the information that would be required to be included in a Current Report on
Form 8-K (as in effect on the Issue Date) filed with the SEC by the Issuer (if the Issuer were required to
prepare and file such form) but subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of information in
the Offering Circular; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Issuer to make available (i) any
information regarding the occurrence of any of the following events if the Issuer determines in its
reasonable determination that such event that would otherwise be required to be disclosed is not material
to the Holders or the business, assets, operations, financial positions or prospects of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) an exhibit or a summary of the terms of, any employment
or compensatory arrangement, agreement, plan or understanding between the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries and any director, manager or executive officer of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries,
(iii) copies of any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be required to be filed as
exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K or (iv) any trade secrets, privileged or confidential information
obtained from another Person and competitively sensitive information:

(a) the entry into or termination of material agreements;


-----

(b) significant acquisitions or dispositions (which shall only be with respect to acquisitions or
dispositions that are significant pursuant to the definition of “Significant Subsidiary”);

(c) bankruptcy;

(d) cross-default under direct material financial obligations;

(e) a change in the Issuer’s certifying independent auditor;

(f) the appointment or departure of directors or executive officers (with respect to the principal
executive officer, president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and principal
operating officer only);

(g) non-reliance on previously issued financial statements; and

(h) change of control transactions.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, for so long as the Secured Notes remain subject to this
paragraph (a), the Issuer will furnish to Holders thereof and prospective investors in such Secured Notes, upon their
request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) (as in effect on the Issue Date) of the
Securities Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be required to provide (i) segment reporting and disclosure
(including any required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280), (ii) separate financial statements
or other information contemplated by Rules 3-03(e), 3-05, 3-09, 3-10, 3-16 or 4-08 of Regulation S-X (or any
successor provisions) or any schedules required by Regulation S-X, (iii) information required by Regulation G under
the Exchange Act or Item 10, Item 302, Item 402 or Item 601 of Regulation S-K (or any successor provision), (iv)
XBRL exhibits, (v) earnings per share information, (vi) information regarding executive compensation and related
party disclosure related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A, 34-54302A and IC-27444A, and (vii) other information
customarily excluded from an offering memorandum, including any information that is not otherwise of the type and
form currently included in the Offering Circular relating to the Secured Notes. In addition, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Issuer will not be required to (i) comply with Sections 302, 906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any information, certificates or reports required by Items 307 or 308 of
Regulation S-K (or any successor provision). To the extent any such information is not so filed or furnished, as
applicable, within the time periods specified above and such information is subsequently filed or furnished, as
applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any
Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured; provided that such cure shall not otherwise affect
the rights of the Holders under “—Events of Default” if Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Secured Notes have declared the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations
on all the outstanding Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately and such declaration shall not have been
rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure.

The requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs may be satisfied by (i) delivering such information
electronically to the Trustee and (ii) the Issuer using commercially reasonable efforts to post copies of such
information on a website (which may be nonpublic and may be maintained by the Issuer or a third party) to which
access will be given to Holders and prospective purchasers of the Secured Notes (which prospective purchasers will
be limited to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S.
persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Issuer. To the extent the Issuer determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available
in the manner described in the preceding sentence after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, the Issuer
shall furnish such reports to the Holders, upon their request. The Issuer may condition the delivery of any such
reports to such Holders and prospective purchasers of the Secured Notes on the agreement of such Persons to
(i) treat all such reports (and the information contained there) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such
reports (and the information contained therein) and information for any purpose other than their investment or


-----

potential investment in the Secured Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information
contained therein) and information.

The Secured Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial
information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; provided that the
same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the
information relating to such Parent Entity, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating
information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited.

The obligations under this covenant may be satisfied by having the applicable entity furnish reports containing
the information contemplated hereby to the Holders of the Secured Notes or filed reports containing the information
contemplated hereby with the SEC.

If the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant will include a presentation of selected financial metrics (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) of
such Unrestricted Subsidiaries as a group in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.”

Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee under the Secured Indenture is for
informational purposes only and the information and the Trustee’s receipt of the foregoing shall not constitute actual
or constructive notice of any information contained therein, or determinable from information contained therein
including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants thereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely
exclusively on an Officer’s Certificate). The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze reports delivered to it.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer will not be deemed to have failed to comply with
any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under the caption “Events of Default and Remedies” until
180 days after the date any report hereunder is due.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Secured Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default with respect to the
Secured Notes:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of,
or premium, if any, on the Secured Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Secured Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by
the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or
agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) contained in the Secured
Indenture or the Secured Notes; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Secured
Indenture provisions described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Reports,” such period of
continuance of such default or breach shall be 270 days after written notice described in this clause has
been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is
secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary
or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) or
the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed


-----

to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created
after the Issue Date, if both:

(a) such default either (i) results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its
stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or (ii) results in the
acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such
Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to
any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to the
greater of $685.0 million and 35.0% of LTM EBITDA or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final non-appealable judgments
aggregating in excess of the greater of $685.0 million and 35.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of amounts
covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable companies), which final
judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such
judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement
proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly
stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or
any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary);

(7) the Secured Note Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force
and effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Secured Indenture or the release of any such
Secured Note Guarantee in accordance with the Secured Indenture (including the Agreed Security
Principles); or

(8) (i) the Liens created by the Collateral Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and perfected
Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless perfection is not
required by the Secured Indenture or the Collateral Documents) other than (A) in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Collateral Document or the Secured Indenture, (B) the satisfaction in full of all
Obligations under the Secured Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results from the failure of the
Notes Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates delivered to it representing securities
pledged under the Collateral Documents or (ii) the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any
pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any Collateral Document is
invalid or unenforceable, and in each case of clause (i) and (ii), such default continues for 30 days after
receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes.

However, a Default under clause (3), (4) or (5) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes notify the Issuers of
the Default and, with respect to clauses (3) and (5), the Issuers do not cure such Default within the time specified in
clause (3) or (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given
with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of
Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent to
provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by
any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each
such Holder delivered to the Issuers and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing System”) or the Relevant Clearing System’s
nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position
_Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of_
Default (a “Default Direction”) shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is
cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Secured Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is


-----

deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuers with such other
information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such
Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In
any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any
Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of
the Secured Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee and the
Relevant Clearing System shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification
Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the Issuers
determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an
Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuers have initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a
determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to
invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect
to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be
automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration
of the Secured Notes, the Issuers provide to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an Officer’s
Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to
such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted
from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending
satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s
participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the
percentage of Secured Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have
been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio
(other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with
the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee
and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any
notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered
to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy
or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs.

For the avoidance of doubt, each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Secured Indenture, shall have
no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any
Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make
calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative
Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall
have any liability to the Issuers, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the
Secured Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuers or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the then total outstanding Secured Notes by written notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may declare the
principal of and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on all the then outstanding Secured
Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section occurs and is
continuing, all outstanding Secured Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The
Secured Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default,
except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding
notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Secured Notes. Any time
period in the Secured Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed
by a court of competent jurisdiction.


-----

The Secured Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any
Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—
Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the
Secured Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or
such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in
the Secured Indenture.

The Secured Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Secured Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Secured Notes
waive all past or any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Secured Indenture (except
a continuing Default in the payment of interest or the principal of any Secured Note held by a non-consenting
Holder) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Secured Notes and its consequences; provided such
rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any Event of Default
specified in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof
(excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Secured Notes) shall be
annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30
days after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or

(2) Holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving
rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will
be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Secured Indenture at the request or
direction of any of the Holders of the Secured Notes unless the Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to
the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent, as the case may be, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of
principal or interest when due, no Holder of a Secured Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Secured
Indenture or the Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Secured Notes have
requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders of the Secured Notes have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or
security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Secured Notes have not
given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, under the Secured Indenture the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The
Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Secured Indenture or that the
Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Secured Note or that would involve
the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee shall have no duty to determine whether an
action is prejudicial to a minority holder).

The Secured Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after
the end of each fiscal year, a statement regarding whether the signer thereof knows of any Default that occurred


-----

during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any Default, its status and what actions the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an
event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Secured Indenture and
such notice references the Secured Notes and the Secured Indenture and states that it is a “notice of default.”

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or stockholder of the
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent Entities or Affiliates shall have any liability, for any obligations of the
Issuer, the Co-Issuers or the Guarantors under the Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Secured Notes waives and releases
all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Secured Notes. Such waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a
waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer, the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors under the Secured Notes Documents of each
applicable series will terminate (other than certain obligations), and the Liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the
Secured Notes of any applicable series will be released and all then existing Defaults and Events of Default will be
cured and the Issuer, the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors will be released upon payment of principal and interest on
the Secured Notes of such series to redemption or maturity, as the case may be. The Issuers may, at their option and
at any time, elect to have all of their obligations discharged with respect to the Secured Notes of any applicable
series and have the Issuer’s, the Co-Issuers’ and each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Secured
Note Guarantee of such series (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Secured Notes of such series to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Secured Notes of such series when such payments are due solely
out of the trust created pursuant to the Secured Indenture;

(2) the Issuers’ obligations with respect to Secured Notes of such series concerning issuing temporary
Secured Notes of such series, registration of such Secured Notes of such series, mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Secured Notes of such series and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and
money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuers’ obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Secured Indenture.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have their obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Secured Indenture, and the Liens, if
any, on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes of such series released (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter
any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default with respect to the Secured Notes of
such series. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership,
rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under the caption “—Events of Default and
Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Secured Notes of such series.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Secured Notes of any
applicable series:

(1) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit with (i) the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as
agent) by the Issuer for this purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the USD Secured Notes
Tranche 1 and the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2, cash in Dollars, U.S. Government Securities, or a
combination thereof, (ii) the Non-USD Paying Agent (or another entity designated or appointed (as
agent) by the Issuer for this purpose) for the benefit of the Holders of the Euro Secured Notes, cash in


-----

Euros, European Government Securities, or a combination thereof and (iii) the Non-USD Paying Agent
(or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Issuer for this purpose) for the benefit of the
Holders of the Sterling Secured Notes, cash in Sterling, U.K. Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due
on the applicable Secured Notes of such series on the Stated Maturity date or on the Redemption Date,
as the case may be; provided that, upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Secured Indenture to the extent
that an amount is deposited with the Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent (or another entity
designated or appointed (as agent) by the Issuer for this purpose) equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any
such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee or the
applicable Paying Agent (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Issuer for this
purpose) on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an
Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent at least two Business
Days prior to the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuers have received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue
Service a ruling, or

(b) since the issuance of the Secured Notes of any applicable series, there has been a change in the
applicable U.S. federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial holders of the Secured Notes of such series will not recognize income,
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial holders of the
Secured Notes of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to such Tax on the same amounts,
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had
not occurred;

(4) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Issuers with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the
Issuers; and

(5) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which
Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all
conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as
the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Secured Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreements and
the Collateral Documents, will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Secured Notes (or, if with
respect to less than all Secured Notes, the Secured Notes of any applicable series), and the Liens, if any, on the
Collateral securing the Secured Notes of any applicable series will be released only as to such series of Secured
Notes (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Secured Notes of such series and the rights of the
Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as expressly provided for in the Secured Indenture), when either:

(1) all Secured Notes of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed
Secured Notes of such series which have been replaced or paid and Secured Notes of such series for


-----

whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or released, have been delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all Secured Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have
become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become
due and payable within one year or may be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the
expense, of the Issuers and the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or any Guarantor have deposited or caused to be
deposited with (i) the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Issuer for this
purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 and the USD
Secured Notes Tranche 2, cash in Dollars, U.S. Government Securities, or a combination thereof, (ii) the
Non-USD Paying Agent (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Issuer for this
purpose) for the benefit of the Holders of the Euro Secured Notes, cash in Euros, European Government
Securities, or a combination thereof or (iii) the Non-USD Paying Agent (or another entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by the Issuer for this purpose) for the benefit of the Holders of the Sterling Secured
Notes, cash in Sterling, U.K. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as
will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on the Secured Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee or the
applicable Registrar for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of
maturity or redemption; provided that, upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Secured Indenture to the extent
that an amount is deposited with the Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent (or another entity
designated or appointed (as agent) by the Issuer for this purpose) equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required
to be deposited with the Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent (or another entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by the Issuer for this purpose) on or prior to the date of redemption. Any
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and the
applicable Paying Agent at least two Business Days prior to the deposit of such Applicable Premium
Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(b) the Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by them under the Secured Indenture;
and

(c) the Issuers have delivered instructions to the Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Secured Notes of any applicable series at maturity or
the Redemption Date, as the case may be.

The Secured Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreements and
the Collateral Documents, will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Secured Notes, and the
Liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes will be released when each series of Secured Notes has
been satisfied and discharged in accordance with the foregoing.

In addition, the Issuers must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1) and
(2)).

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as otherwise provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Secured Notes Documents may be
amended, supplemented or modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Secured Notes then outstanding, including consents obtained before or after a Change of Control or in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Secured Notes, and any existing Default or Event of
Default or compliance with any provision thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes (including consents obtained before or
after a Change of Control or in connection with a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for the Secured


-----

Notes); provided that (x) if any such amendment or supplement will only affect one series of Secured Notes (or less
than all series of Secured Notes) then outstanding under the Secured Indenture, then only the consent of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Secured Notes of such series then outstanding (including consents obtained
before or after a Change of Control or in connection with a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for the
Secured Notes of such series) shall be required and (y) if any such amendment or supplement by its terms will affect
a series of Secured Notes in a manner that is different from and materially adverse relative to the manner in which
such amendment or supplement affects other series of Secured Notes, then the consent of the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Secured Notes of such series then outstanding (including consents obtained before or after
a Change of Control or in connection with a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for the Secured Notes of
such series) shall be required. With respect to any series of Secured Notes, (i) any Default or Event of Default with
respect to such series of Secured Notes or (ii) compliance with any provision of the Secured Indenture, the Secured
Notes of such series or the Secured Note Guarantees may, in each case, be waived as provided under “—Events of
Defaults and Remedies.”

However, the Secured Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder of Secured
Notes of such series, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Secured Notes of such series held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Secured Note (other than provisions
relating to Change of Control and Asset Sales) or reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of
any such Secured Note or change the time at which any such Secured Note may be redeemed, in each
case as described above under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(3) reduce the rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Secured Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Sales);

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal of or premium, if any,
or interest on the Secured Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Secured Notes by the Holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes outstanding and a waiver of the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration;

(5) make any Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions which required the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence;

(7) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of and
interest on such Holder’s Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor; and

(8) make any change to or modify the ranking of such Secured Notes that would adversely affect the
Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, the Co-Issuers, any Guarantor (with respect to a Secured Note
Guarantee or the Secured Indenture to which it is a party), the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and the other
parties thereto, as the case may be, may amend or supplement any Secured Notes Documents without the consent of
any Holder to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency or reduce the minimum
denomination of the Secured Notes;

(2) provide for uncertificated Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Secured Notes or to
alter the provisions of the Secured Indenture relating to the form of the Secured Notes (including related
definitions);

(3) comply with the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or
Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”;


-----

(4) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the Issuer’s, Co-Issuers’ or any Guarantor’s
obligations under any Secured Notes Document;

(5) make any change (including changing the CUSIP, ISIN, Common Code or other identifying number on
any Secured Notes) that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not
materially and adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) add or modify covenants or provide for a Secured Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders;

(7) at the Issuers’ election, comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the
qualification of the Secured Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Secured Indenture of a successor
Trustee or successor Paying Agent thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the
accession by the Trustee to any Secured Notes Document;

(9) provide for the issuance of exchange notes or private exchange notes, which are identical to exchange
notes except that they are not freely transferable;

(10) add a Guarantor or a co-obligor of the Secured Notes under the Secured Indenture;

(11) conform the text of the Secured Notes Documents to any provision of this “Description of Secured

Notes”;

(12) make any amendment to the provisions of the Secured Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of

Secured Notes as permitted by the Secured Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the
issuance and administration of the Secured Notes; provided, however, that such amendment does not
materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Secured Notes;

(13) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described

under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of
Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” to add Secured Note Guarantees with respect to the Secured
Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Secured Note Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the
Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Secured
Indenture;

(14) make such provisions as necessary for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(15) comply with the rules and procedures of any applicable securities depositary;

(16) make any amendment to the provisions of the Secured Notes Documents to eliminate the effect of any

Accounting Change or in the application thereof as described in the last paragraph of the definition of
“GAAP”;

(17) mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent or the

Trustee for the benefit of the Trustee or the holders of the Secured Notes as additional security for the
payment and performance of the Issuer’s, the Co-Issuers or any Guarantor’s obligations under the
Secured Notes Documents, in any property, or assets, including any of which are required to be
mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the
Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents;

(18) add additional parties with Pari Passu Lien Priority to any Collateral Documents;

(19) enter into any intercreditor agreement having substantially similar terms with respect to the Holders as

those set forth in one of the Intercreditor Agreements, taken as a whole, or any joinder thereto;

(20) in the case of any Collateral Document, to include therein any legend required to be set forth therein

pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or to modify any such legend as required by the Intercreditor
Agreements; or


-----

(21) to provide for the succession of any parties to the Collateral Documents (and other amendments that are

administrative or ministerial in nature) in connection with an amendment, renewal, extension,
substitution, refinancing, restructuring, replacement, supplementing or other modification from time to
time of the Senior Credit Facilities or any other agreement that is not prohibited by the Secured
Indenture.

In addition, the Holders will be deemed to have consented for purposes of the Collateral Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreements to any of the following amendments and other modifications to the Collateral Documents
or Intercreditor Agreements:

(1) (a) to add other parties (or any authorized agent thereof or trustee therefor) holding Credit Agreement
Obligations that is incurred in compliance with the ABL Credit Facility, the Credit Agreements, the Secured
Indenture, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes Indenture, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements
and (b) to establish that the Liens on any Collateral securing such Obligations shall be under the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement with the Liens on such Collateral securing the Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the
Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees, all on the terms provided for in the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement in effect immediately prior to such amendment or other modification;

(2) to establish that the Liens on any Collateral securing any Indebtedness replacing the Credit Agreements
and the Existing 2026 Secured Notes permitted to be incurred under the Secured Indenture shall be pari passu to the
Liens on such Collateral securing any Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes and the Secured
Note Guarantees, all on the terms provided for in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement in effect immediately prior
to such amendment or other modification;

(3) to establish that the Liens on any ABL Collateral securing any Indebtedness replacing the ABL Credit
Facility permitted to be incurred under the Secured Indenture shall be senior to the Liens on such ABL Collateral
securing any Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees, and that
the Liens on any Notes Collateral securing any such Indebtedness shall be junior to the Liens on such Notes
Collateral securing any Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes and the Secured Note
Guarantees, all on the terms provided for in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement in effect immediately prior to such
amendment and other modification; and

(4) upon any cancellation or termination of the ABL Credit Facility without a replacement thereof, to establish
that the ABL Collateral (in addition to the Notes Collateral) shall secure the Obligations under the Secured
Indenture, the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees on a first-priority basis, subject to the terms of the
Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement in effect immediately prior to such amendment or other modification.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate principal
amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may (A) make any change in any Collateral
Document or the provisions in the Secured Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust proceeds of the
Collateral with the effect of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which secure the
Obligations in respect of the Secured Notes or (B) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the Obligations
in respect of the Secured Notes in any material portion of the Collateral in any way materially adverse, taken as a
whole, to the Holders, other than, in each case, as provided under the terms of the Secured Indenture, the Collateral
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Secured Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Secured Indenture by any Holder of
Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by
such tender.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under the caption
“—Certain Covenants,” or action taken in compliance with the covenants in effect at the time of such action, shall
be deemed to impair or affect any legal rights of any Holders of the Secured Notes to receive payment of principal


-----

of or premium, if any, or interest on the Secured Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or
with respect to such Holder’s Secured Notes.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Euro Secured Notes and the Sterling Secured Notes are listed on the Exchange and if
and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Issuers with respect to the Secured Notes
listed on the Exchange will be sent to the Authority. All notices to Holders of Secured Notes will be validly given if
electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any,
maintained by the registrar. For so long as any Secured Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders
will be delivered to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which
will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests. To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream conflict with any such requirements, a notice will be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of the Secured Indenture if it complies with the mandatory rules and procedures of DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the earlier of such publication and the fifth day after being so mailed.
Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other
equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to
electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency
with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed in the manner
provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given
through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuers or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Issuers or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Secured Notes will be prescribed six
years
after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated or Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

U.S. dollars, with respect to the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 and the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2, euro,
with respect to the Euro Secured Notes, and sterling, with respect to the Sterling Secured Notes, are the required
currencies (each, a “Required Currency”) of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuers and the
Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the applicable Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees
thereof, if any, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the applicable
Required Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction,
in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuers, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder, any Paying Agent, by the
Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuers or a Guarantor
will only constitute a discharge to the Issuers or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the amount of the
applicable Required Currency which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in
that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that
date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so). If the amount of the applicable Required Currency is less
than the amount of the Required Currency expressed to be due to the recipient, any Paying Agent, the Trustee or the
Notes Collateral Agent under any Secured Note, the Issuers and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss
sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuers and the Guarantors will indemnify the
recipient, any Paying Agent, the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent on a joint and several basis against the cost of


-----

making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of
the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Secured Note, any Paying Agent, the Trustee or the Notes Collateral
Agent to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuer (indicating the sources of information
used) the loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause
of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Secured Note, any Paying Agent, the
Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full
force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due
under any Secured Note or any Secured Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Notes Collateral
Agent. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any Eurodenominated or Sterling-denominated restriction herein, the Euro equivalent or Sterling equivalent amount,
respectively, for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-Euro or non-Sterling currency shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-Euro or non-Sterling amount is incurred
or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Euro Secured Notes and the Sterling Secured Notes on the Exchange and
for permission to be granted to deal in the Euro Secured Notes and the Sterling Secured Notes on the Exchange.
There can be no assurance that the application to list the Euro Secured Notes and the Sterling Secured Notes on the
Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Euro Secured Notes and the Sterling Secured Notes
thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Euro Secured Notes and the Sterling Secured Notes is not conditioned
on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a material portion of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuers or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Secured Indenture and
the Secured Notes, the Issuers and the Guarantors will in the Secured Indenture irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York,
in the United States of America. The Secured Indenture will provide that each of the Issuers and the Guarantors will
appoint an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Secured Indenture, the
Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the
City of New York.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Wilmington Trust, National Association is the Trustee under the Secured Indenture.

The Secured Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it
become a creditor of the Issuers, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Issuer, the Co-Issuers and their respective Affiliates.

The Secured Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Secured Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Secured Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth
specifically in such Secured Indenture. The Secured Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall


-----

occur and be known to the Trustee (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its
rights and powers vested in it by the Secured Indenture, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct
of such person’s own affairs. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the Secured Indenture at the request of any Holder of the Secured Notes,
unless such Holder shall have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent
security and indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as the case may be, against any
loss, liability or expense.

The Secured Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Fixed


-----

Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, deemed incurrence,
assumption, guarantee, redemption (including as contemplated by any such irrevocable notice of redemption),
repayment, defeasance, retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter
period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof)
is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on a ratio basket based on the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Debt ratio, such
ratio(s) shall be calculated with respect to such incurrence, issuance or other transaction without giving effect to
amounts being utilized under any other basket (other than a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio) on the same date. Each item of
Indebtedness that is incurred or issued, each Lien incurred and each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to
have been incurred, issued or taken first, to the extent available, pursuant to the relevant Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio test.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof)
is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on a ratio basket based on a
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, such
ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the incurrence of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter
of credit facility (1) immediately prior to or in connection therewith or (2) used to finance working capital needs of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Secured Indenture shall provide that any calculation or measure that is determined with reference to the
Issuer’s financial statements (including EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Income, Fixed
Charges, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio and Consolidated Total Net Debt
Ratio) may be determined with reference to the financial statements of a Parent Entity instead, so long as such
Parent Entity does not hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the Capital Stock of the Issuer.

For purposes of making the computation referred to in the paragraph above, Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansion and disposed or
discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) that have been made by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or
prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro
_forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations,_
operational changes, business expansion and disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated
fixed charge obligations and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the fourquarter reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the
beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, operational change, business expansion or disposed or discontinued operation that would have
required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro
_forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,_
consolidation, operational change, business expansion or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period (subject to the threshold specified in the previous sentence).

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction (including the
Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer
of the Issuer (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating improvements, synergies and
expense reductions which is being given pro forma effect). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is
being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any
Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to
accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be
the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making
the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro


-----

forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable
period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or
other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such
optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum, without duplication, of:

(1) Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period;

(2) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any series

are in effect from time to time; provided that all terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Secured
Indenture shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Secured Indenture shall
be made (a) without giving effect to any election under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825—Financial
Instruments, or any successor thereto or comparable accounting principle (including pursuant to the Accounting
Standards Codification), to value any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein
and (b) the amount of any Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations shall be
determined in accordance with the definition of Capitalized Lease Obligations. At any time after the Issue Date, the
Issuer may elect to apply IFRS accounting principles in lieu of GAAP and, upon any such election, references herein
to GAAP shall thereafter be construed to mean IFRS (except as otherwise provided in the Secured Indenture);
_provided that any such election, once made, shall be irrevocable; provided, further, any calculation or determination_
in the Secured Indenture that requires the application of GAAP for periods that include fiscal quarters ended prior to
the Issuer’s election to apply IFRS shall remain as previously calculated or determined in accordance with GAAP.
The Issuer shall give notice of any such election made in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For the
avoidance of doubt, solely making an election (without any other action) referred to in this definition will not be
treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness.

If there occurs a change in IFRS or GAAP, as the case may be, and such change would cause a change in the
method of calculation of any standards, terms or measures used in the Secured Indenture (an “Accounting _Change”),_
then the Issuer may elect that such standards, terms or measures shall be calculated as if such Accounting Change
had or had not occurred.

Secured Indebtedness;

        - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of
Preferred Stock and other liabilities of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; and

        - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor.

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Notes, and Note Guarantees provided may be released
in certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Claims of holders of
the notes offered hereby will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that will
not guarantee the notes offered hereby.” In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding
of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their
trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor, and
claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally
will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of
creditors of the Issuers, including Holders. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our Non-Guarantors,
including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes. Although the Indenture will limit the
incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject
to a number of significant exceptions. The Indenture will not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness that may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the Non-Guarantors. See “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock.”

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Issuers and the Guarantors (exclusive of the Target and
its consolidated Subsidiaries) represented approximately 95.6% of the Issuer’s total revenues, 85.0% of the Issuer’s
total assets and 95.6% of the Issuer’s total liabilities, after excluding intercompany transactions and balances.

In addition and subject to certain exceptions and the Agreed Security Principles, the Target and each of the
Target’s material Subsidiaries incorporated in the United States, Luxembourg and England and Wales will guarantee


-----

the Notes by the later of (i) 150 days after the Issue Date and (ii) the date on which such U.S. or Foreign Subsidiaries
provide a Guarantee under the Senior Credit Facilities. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, Target
entities organized in the United States, Luxembourg and England and Wales represented approximately 49.0% of the
Target’s total revenues and 61.0% of the Target’s total assets.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Note
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference under applicable law,
including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law or
provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees
provided by Guarantors that are Foreign Subsidiaries will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security
Principles.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
Covenants—Liens,” in respect of guarantees or collateral provided by or over the assets of (or equity interests in)
Foreign Subsidiaries, certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights
and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The
following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among
others:

(a) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and
other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalisation,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign
_corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules_
and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or
approval requirements and similar principles;

(b) the determination that the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes (including, in
respect of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, their investors and/or their shareholders),
interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs guarantee fees payable to any
Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and all applicable legal fees) would be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee
or security;

(c) the determination that, in respect of any guarantee or security which it is determined may be required
to be discharged and/or released in connection with any corporate, tax structuring or other
reorganization of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (an “Anticipated Reorganization”), the
applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty,
registration taxes, notarial costs guarantee fees payable to any person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary and all applicable legal fees) of taking, and then subsequently discharging
and/or releasing such guarantee or security in connection with any Anticipated Reorganization, will
not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such
guarantee or security;

(d) subject to certain exceptions, that members of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in any
jurisdiction outside of the United States of America (other than Atlas LuxCo 1 S.à r.l. or any whollyowned subsidiary of Atlas LuxCo 1 S.à r.l.) will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
Security Documents if they are not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary or if it is not within the legal
capacity of the relevant members of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or if it would conflict
with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory
or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal
or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries;
_provided that reasonable efforts (for a period of not more than 10 Business Days but without_
incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome
any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;


-----

(e) the agreement that guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and
all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an
amount to be agreed between the Issuer and the collateral agent under the Credit Agreements in
accordance with the terms of the corresponding Credit Agreements;

(f) the agreement that where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if
the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such
security, security will be granted over the material assets only;

(g) the agreement that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

(h) the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract,
lease, licence, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or
regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from
being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a
consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which,
if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or
otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially
adverse to the interests of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or any member thereof; provided
that reasonable efforts (for a period of not more than 20 Business Days but without incurring
material cost) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries if the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such
efforts will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

(i) the agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the
perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on
the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct their operations and business in
the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Note Documents (including dealing with the
secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing
to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Event of Default which is
continuing);

(j) the agreement that any security document will only be required to be notarised if required by law in
order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

(k) the agreement that, on request, no guarantee or security will be required to be given (and no consent
shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) by or over any acquired entity or business
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Target and its Subsidiaries) which are required to
guarantee, secure or otherwise credit support Indebtedness acquired in connection with an
acquisition which is not prohibited by the Note Documents (or in each case (Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness) (“Applicable Debt”) to the extent such indebtedness
is permitted by the Note Documents to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a
target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition not prohibited by the Note
Documents (or the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries making such acquisition) shall be required
to become a guarantor or grant security with respect to any Note Documents if prevented by the
terms of the documentation governing the Applicable Debt or if becoming a Guarantor or the
granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under
or in relation thereto. No security or Lien in favour of the other Secured Parties will be granted or
continue to subsist over any asset of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries secured for the benefit
of any Permitted Indebtedness (including Applicable Debt) and to the extent constituting a Lien
permitted by the Note Documents;

(l) the agreement that no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title
insurance will be required;


-----

(m) the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third
party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which
do not prohibit or prevent the creation of security over such accounts) or any cash constituting
regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant
security document);

(n) the agreement that neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary will be required to take any
action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment, sub-participation or
transfer by any relevant secured party (and unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Note
Documents the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not bear or otherwise be liable for any
taxes, any notarial registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from
any assignment, sub-participation or transfer by any relevant secured party);

(o) the agreement that each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any
transaction not prohibited under the Note Documents and the security granted under each security
document entered into after the Issue Date shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security
Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant security document and creation of the
relevant security;

(p) the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover
or sharing provisions (or any substantially equivalent provisions) in the applicable intercreditor
agreements;

(q) the agreement that the relevant secured parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by
them at the relevant time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to
them under the terms of the Note Documents prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which
is continuing;

(r) the agreement that no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap
_Obligations” defined in accordance with the Loan Syndications and Trading Association’s (the_
“LSTA”) Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations'
_Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;_

(s) the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing
or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(t) the agreement that no fixed security will be required to be granted over real estate, intellectual
property, letter of credit rights, tort claims (or the equivalent in any jurisdiction), insurance policies,
aircraft, ships and vessels, motor vehicles, governmental contracts or governmental or regulatory
licenses;

(u) the agreement that no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to
any security will be required to be prepared or provided to the relevant secured party (or any agent
or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) unless (i) required for such
documents to become effective or admissible in evidence, and (ii) an Event of Default is continuing;

(v) the fact that closure, unavailability, or reduced service of any governmental or regulatory systems,
any functions or any facilities (including notarial or legal facilities) necessary or customarily used
for the granting of security or guarantees, or the taking of any perfection requirements in connection
therewith, may affect and/or delay the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to provide
a guarantee or security or take any related steps in connection with any perfection requirements; and

(w) the agreement that where the terms of a security document require a party thereto (other than any
secured party) to use its “reasonable efforts,” “reasonable endeavours” or a similar or equivalent


-----

standard in taking an action thereunder, notwithstanding any meaning to the contrary as a matter of
the governing law of such security document, such standards shall be interpreted and construed in
accordance with the law of England and Wales and no Default or Event of Default (howsoever
described) shall arise under any Note Documents in respect of a breach of such obligation because
a contrary construction of such provision was taken (or would be taken by any applicable court of
competent jurisdiction).

By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less
than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note
Guarantee. If a Note Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be declared entirely void or subordinated by a court
to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on
the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Note Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to avoid the notes offered hereby and the guarantees, and
the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the
notes offered hereby, the guarantees and the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees
and/or require holders of the notes offered hereby to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees
and the liens in respect of the secured notes offered hereby and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on
the notes offered hereby.” The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor
will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(1) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor after
which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) all or substantially all of
the assets of such Guarantor (including to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or another Guarantor), in each
case, if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition is made in compliance with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture;

(2) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of its
Guarantees of payment (i) by the Issuer of any Indebtedness of the Issuer under the Senior Credit
Facilities or (ii) as a result of the Guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Issuers or a Guarantor
which resulted in the creation of such Note Guarantee, except in the case of clause (i) or (ii), a
release or discharge by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it being understood that a
release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release) and will constitute a release
for the purposes of this provision, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note
Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide
a Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(3) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event after
which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture;

(4) the exercise by the Issuers of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
provided in “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the satisfaction and discharge of
the Issuers’ obligations under the Indenture as provided in “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) to the extent that such Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of
clause (i) of the definition of “Immaterial Subsidiary,” upon the release of the Guarantee referred to
in such clause;


-----

(6) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer, the CoIssuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(7) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; provided that such Note Guarantee
shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and

(8) as described under the caption “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Note Guarantee by a Parent Entity may be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged for any reason.

**Ranking**

The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and the payment of any Note
Guarantee will rank pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, the CoIssuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, including the obligations of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer and such
Guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes
and the Secured Notes.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s,
the Co-Issuer’s and any Guarantor’s existing and future Secured Indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such Secured Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, on a _pro forma_ basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, the Issuers and the Guarantors would have had Secured Indebtedness of approximately $9,120.0 million
outstanding (excluding capitalized leases), including borrowings and the related guarantees under the Senior Credit
Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Secured Notes with $300 million and €300.0 million available for
borrowing under the revolving credit facilities under the Credit Agreements and $1,500.0 million available for
borrowing under the ABL Credit Facility, without giving effect to approximately $275.0 million of outstanding letters
of credit at December 31, 2020, which, if drawn, would be Secured Indebtedness.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur the amount of such additional Indebtedness could be substantial and, in any case,
such Indebtedness may be Secured Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuers will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent for the Notes
will be the Trustee. The Issuers will also maintain one or more registrars and a transfer agent. The initial registrar and
transfer agent with respect to the Notes will be the Trustee. The registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership
of the Notes outstanding from time to time. The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of a Note for all
purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture. The Paying Agent will make payments on the
Notes, and the transfer agent will facilitate transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuers. Payments of principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency designated by the Issuers or, at the
option of the Issuers, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their respective addresses
set forth in the register of Holders. Until otherwise designated by the Issuers, the Issuers’ office or agency maintained
for such purpose will be the office of the Trustee.

The Issuers may change the Paying Agents, the registrars or the transfer agents without prior notice to the
Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a Paying Agent, registrar or transfer agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the restrictions
set forth in the section of this Offering Circular entitled “Transfer Restrictions.” The registrar and the Trustee may


-----

require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Notes.
Holders will be required to pay all Taxes due on transfer. The Issuers will not be required to transfer or exchange any
Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer, an Asset Sale Offer or other tender offer. Also, the Issuers will not be required to issue, register the transfer of
or exchange any Note during the period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of redemption of Notes or between
a record date and the next succeeding interest payment date.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuers will issue an aggregate principal amount of $1,285.0 million of Notes in this offering. The Notes
will mature on        , 2029. Subject to compliance with the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the
Issuers may issue additional Notes from time to time after the Issue Date under the Indenture (any such notes, the
“Additional Notes”). Any Additional Notes issued in the future under the Indenture will be identical in all respects to
the Notes that we are issuing on the Issue Date, except that the Additional Notes issued in the future may have different
issue prices and will have different issue dates, first interest payment dates and first dates from which interest will
accrue; provided that if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
Additional Notes will be issued with a separate CUSIP number and ISIN. The Notes offered by the Issuers and any
Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
Indenture (except as otherwise provided herein), including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all purposes under the Indenture and this “Description
of Unsecured Notes” include any Additional Notes that are actually issued. The Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of $200,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, neither
DTC nor the Trustee is required to monitor or enforce the minimum amount.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of       % per annum and will be payable semi-annually in
arrears on        and      , commencing on      , 2021, to the Holders of Notes of record on the immediately
preceding        and        . Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has
been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Notes will be computed
on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuers are not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described
under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders,
including the Investors, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to
purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market
transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing
our Indebtedness, including the Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance
sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities.
The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such
purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant
reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the
“adjusted issue price” (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of
indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to us.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Issuers will not be entitled to redeem Notes at their option prior to       ,
2024.

At any time prior to       , 2024, the Issuers may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at their option,
on one or more occasions, upon such notice as is described under the caption “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption (the “Redemption Date”), subject to the


-----

rights of Holders of such Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date.

At any time and from time to time on or after      , 2024, the Issuers may redeem the Notes, in whole or
in part, at their option, on one or more occasions, upon notice as described under the caption “—Selection and Notice,”
at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed) set forth below,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date (provided that if
the redemption date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then
Holders in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on
the repurchase date) if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on        of each of the years indicated
below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2024 ...............................................................................................................................................         %
2025 ...............................................................................................................................................         %
2026 and thereafter ........................................................................................................................  100.000%

In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to       , 2024, the Issuers may, at their option, on one
or more occasions, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture (including
the principal amount of any Additional Notes issued under the Indenture) at a redemption price equal to        %
of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the
applicable Redemption Date (provided that if the redemption date is on or after the record date and on or before the
corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business
on such record date will receive interest on the redemption date) with the net cash proceeds received by the Issuers
from one or more Equity Offerings; provided that (a) at least 40% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the
then-outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes) (other than Notes or Additional
Notes held by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of
each such redemption, unless all such Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently and (b) each such redemption
occurs not later than 180 days after the date of closing of each such Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuers, or
any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuers, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuers or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding
any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. In determining whether the
Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable,
Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer,
Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable.

Any notice of any redemption may be given prior to the redemption thereof, and any such redemption or
notice may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, without limitation,
the consummation or occurrence of an incurrence or issuance of debt or equity, a Change of Control, an Asset Sale or
other transaction or event. If such redemption is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such
notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Redemption
Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed
or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the
Issuers in their sole discretion). Such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the
event that any or all such conditions are not satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion) by the
Redemption Date, or by the Redemption Date as so delayed, or at any time in the Issuers’ discretion if in the good
faith judgment of the Issuers any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied. In addition, the Issuers may provide in


-----

such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuers’ obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person.

If the optional Redemption Date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date will be paid on the
Redemption Date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes
will be subject to redemption by the Issuers.

The Notes to be redeemed shall be selected in accordance with the procedures in the manner described under
the caption “—Selection and Notice.”

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuers are redeeming less than all of the Notes issued under the Indenture at any time, the Trustee will
select the Notes to be redeemed (1) if the Notes are listed on an exchange, as certified to the Trustee by the Issuers, in
compliance with the requirements of such exchange, or in accordance with customary DTC procedures or (2) on a
_pro rata basis to the extent practicable, or, if the pro rata basis is not practicable for any reason, by lot or by such_
other method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate in accordance with DTC procedures. No Notes of $200,000
or less can be redeemed in part.

Notices of purchase or redemption shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 10 days but, except as set forth under “—Optional Redemption,” not more than 60 days before the
purchase or redemption date to each Holder of Notes (with a copy to the Trustee) at such Holder’s registered address
or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be delivered more than
60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, any notice of purchase or
redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be
purchased or redeemed. If the Issuers request the Trustee to give notice of purchase or redemption on its behalf, the
Issuers will give written notice to the Trustee at least 5 Business Days prior to the date on which notice of redemption
is to be sent (or such shorter period as agreed by the Trustee).

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, upon request, the Issuers will issue a new Note in a
principal amount equal to the unpurchased or unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon
cancellation of the original Note; provided, new Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000
and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $200,000. Subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of any conditions
precedent relating thereto, Notes called for purchase or redemption become due on the date fixed for purchase or
redemption. On and after the Redemption Date, unless the Issuers default in the payment of the redemption price,
interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuers have previously or
substantially concurrently therewith electronically delivered or mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the
outstanding Notes as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase
all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change
_of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if_
any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase (provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on
or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose names the Notes are registered at the close
of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date). Within 30 days following any Change of
Control, the Issuers will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by electronic delivery in accordance with the
procedures of DTC or first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such


-----

Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, with the
following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant, and that all Notes properly
tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuers;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60
days from the date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered (the “Change of Control Payment
_Date”), subject to extension (in the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to_
the occurrence of the Change of Control) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of Control
is delayed;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted
for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of
Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on
the reverse of such Notes completed, to the Paying Agent specified in the notice at the address
specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change
of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers
to purchase such Notes; provided that the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business
on the second Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile
transmission, electronic transmission or letter (or otherwise in compliance with the procedures of
DTC) setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for
purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have
such Notes purchased;

(7) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new
Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The
unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $200,000 or any integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof;

(8) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and describing each such
condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment
Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of such
Change of Control was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such
conditions are satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion), or such purchase may not
occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions are not satisfied
(or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion) by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the
Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in the
Issuers’ discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Issuers any or all of such conditions will not
be satisfied. In addition, the Issuers may provide in such notice that payment of the purchase price
and performance of the Issuers’ obligations with respect to such Change of Control Offer may be
performed by another Person; and

(9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with the covenant described
hereunder, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased.


-----

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase
of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuers may
rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement
action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by them or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer,

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with
an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered
to and purchased by the Issuers.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders to require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes
provide, the Secured Notes will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to
which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with
respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control or a change of control under
the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the Secured Notes). If we experience a
change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness, we could seek
a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness. In the event we
do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness, such default could
result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness being declared due and
payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by our then-existing financial resources and sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any
required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to finance a change of
control offer or asset sale offer required by the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase
feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a
transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in
the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture,
but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure
or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and
“—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders
of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such
covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes
protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.


-----

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, (ii) a notice of redemption of all
outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,”
unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable Redemption Date or the
redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption
notice to be satisfied or (iii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuers (or any
Affiliate of the Issuers) have made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a
cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and have purchased all Notes properly tendered in
accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control
Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting
the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may
require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligations to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of Change of Control, may be waived or modified
(at any time, including after a Change of Control) with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Asset Sales**

The Indenture will provide that from and after the Issue Date, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset
Sale), as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the assets subject to such Asset Sale; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, if the property or assets sold or otherwise disposed
have a fair market value in excess of the greater of $980.0 million and 50.0% of LTM EBITDA, at
least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the
Issue Date (on a cumulative basis) (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that each of the
following will be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents for purposes of this clause (2):

(a) any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other
than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes that
(x) are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with
such transfer) or (y) are otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the
transaction with such transferee (other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries) and, in each case, for which the Issuer and all of its Restricted
Subsidiaries have been released;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee or in connection with such Asset Sale (including earnouts
and similar obligations) that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received) or by


-----

their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days
following the closing of such Asset Sale;

(c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Sale (other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary), to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released
from any guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection
with such Asset Sale;

(d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuers (other than intercompany debt owed
to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(e) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, as determined by the
Issuer in good faith, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration
received pursuant to this clause (e) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater
of $590.0 million and 30.0% of LTM EBITDA at the time of the receipt of such Designated
Non-cash Consideration (with the fair market value of each such item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured pursuant to this clause (e) at the Issuer’s option, either
at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale or at the time received and, in either
case, without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); and

(f) any Investment, Capital Stock, assets, property or capital or other expenditure of the kind
referred to in clause (2) of the second paragraph in this “—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Asset Sales.”

Within 540 days after the later of (i) the date of such Asset Sale and (ii) receipt of any Net Proceeds of any
Asset Sale (as may be extended by an Acceptable Commitment or a Second Commitment as set forth below, the
“Proceeds Application Period”), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to
the Applicable Percentage of such Net Proceeds (the “Available Proceeds”) from such Asset Sale:

(1) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase:

(a) Obligations under a Credit Facility (including the Senior Credit Facilities) or any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, and to correspondingly reduce commitments
with respect thereto;

(b) Obligations in respect of other Secured Indebtedness (including the Existing 2026 Secured
Notes and the Secured Notes), and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect
thereto;

(c) Obligations in respect of the Notes or any other Indebtedness (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto); _provided that, to the extent either Issuer or any_
Restricted Subsidiary will so repay any such Indebtedness (other than the Notes), the Issuer
will reduce Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis by, at its option, (i) redeeming
Notes as provided under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” (ii) purchasing Notes
through open-market purchases or (iii) by making an offer (in accordance with the
procedures set forth herein for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes
at a purchase price equal to or higher than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the
amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the principal amount of the Notes to be
repurchased to the date of repurchase; or


-----

(d) Obligations in respect of Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed
to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, in the case of clause (c) above, (i) if an offer to purchase any Indebtedness of the Issuer_
or any Restricted Subsidiary is made, such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the amount
of such offer, whether or not accepted by the holders of such Indebtedness, and no Available
Proceeds in the amount of such offer will be deemed to exist following such offer, and (ii) if the
holder of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer declines the repayment of such
Indebtedness owed to it from such Available Proceeds, such amount will be deemed repaid to the
extent of the declined Available Proceeds; or

(2) (i) to invest (including capital expenditures) in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including
by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary); or (ii) to invest
(including capital expenditures) in any one or more businesses, properties or assets that replace the
businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale, with any such investment
made by way of a capital or other lease valued at the present value of the minimum amount of
payments under such lease (as reasonably determined by the Issuer);

_provided that, in the case of this clause (2), a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted_
application of the Available Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Issuer or
such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or intent with the good faith
expectation that such Available Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180
days of such commitment (or, if later, 540 days after the receipt of such Available Proceeds) (an
“Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before the Available Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second
_Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination (or, if later, 540 days after the_
receipt of such Available Proceeds); _provided further that if any Second Commitment is later_
cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Available Proceeds are applied, then such
Available Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds on the date of such cancellation or termination;
or

(3) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that (1) pending the final application of the amount of any such Available Proceeds_
pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiaries may apply such
Available Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness (including under the Credit Facilities) or
otherwise apply such Available Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture, and (2) the
Issuer (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets
prior to receiving the Available Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale (provided that such
investment shall be made no earlier than execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset
Sale, and consummation of the relevant Asset Sale) and deem the amount so invested to be applied
pursuant to and in accordance with clause (b) above with respect to such Asset Sale.

To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds or Available Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is
denominated in a currency other than Dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the
net amount of funds in Dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Dollars.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Available
Proceeds of any Asset Sale received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is
(x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any
agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated under
applicable local law, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied
in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts shall not be so applied so long, but only so long, as the applicable
local law, documents or agreements will not permit repatriation (the Issuers hereby agrees to use reasonable efforts
(as determined in the Issuers’ reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to


-----

within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly
take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediments or other
impediment to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment
would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the
applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other impediment, an amount equal to such Net
Proceeds (net of additional Taxes that would be payable or reserved against as a result of such repatriation but only to
the extent such Taxes do not reduce Net Proceeds pursuant to the definition thereof) will be promptly (and in any
event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied in compliance with this covenant
and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Proceeds of
any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is
not limited to, any prepayment out of such Net Proceeds whereby doing so the Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries, any
Parent Entity or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a Tax liability, including a Tax
dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding Tax), an amount equal to the Net Proceeds
so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as
a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of
Default.

When the Available Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the
time period set forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such Available Proceeds used
to make an offer to purchase Notes as described in clause (1)(c) above, will be deemed to have been so applied whether
or not such offer is accepted) exceeds the greater of $780.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA (such amount of
Available Proceeds that are less than or equal to the greater of $780.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Declined
_Excess Proceeds,” and such amount of Net Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $780.0 million and 40.0% of_
LTM EBITDA, “Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth
above, the Issuers will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, at the option of the
Issuers, to any holders of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the
Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is, in the case of the Notes, in an amount equal to at least $200,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the
case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if
less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture (and, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, such other
price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness). The Issuers will commence an
Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 30 days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application
Period by delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuers
may, at their option, satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Available Proceeds from an Asset Sale by
making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Available Proceeds prior to the expiration of the Proceeds Application
Period (the “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the Available Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance
of being required to do so by the Indenture or with respect to any Declined Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and such Pari
Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an
Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an
Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in Declined Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Excess Proceeds for any
purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable)
of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds
(or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall select the Notes (while the Notes are in
global form pursuant to the procedures of DTC) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis
based on the accreted value or aggregate principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered;
provided that no Notes will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such
Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Available Proceeds and Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the
Advance Portion) will be reset to zero. An Asset Sale Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited
with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Note Guarantees (but the Asset
Sale Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase


-----

of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuers may
rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement
action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligations to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

The Senior Credit Facilities may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which
the Issuers become parties may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In
the event the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of their lenders to
the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do
not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuers will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In
such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the avoidance
of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below under “—Certain
Covenants.”

**Covenant Suspension**

If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Ratings from two
Rating Agencies (“Investment Grade Status”) and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture
(the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a
“Covenant Suspension Event”), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants
(collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “Repurchase at the Option of Holders”;

(2) “Asset Sales”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(4) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock”;

(5) clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All
Assets”;

(6) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(7) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(8) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.”

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under
the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”)
the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter
again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events unless and until the
Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in
effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status).


-----

The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is
referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension
Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Available Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken
by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or events occurring prior to such reinstatement, or any actions taken at any time
pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, will give rise to a Default, Event of Default
or breach of any kind under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees nor shall the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries bear any liability for such actions or events. With respect to Restricted Payments made after any such
reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant
described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during the
Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount
available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” All
Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified
as having been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3)(b)(i) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”
Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any
Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under the caption “—Transactions with Affiliates.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any
Non-Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the covenant described under the caption “—
Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any
Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under the caption “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.” On and
after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant
to clause (7) of such definition. No Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant

such Person (a) to make payments in lieu of fractional Equity Interests to holders of Equity Interests
of the Issuer or any Parent Entity and (b) to honor any conversion request by a holder of convertible
Indebtedness and make cash payments in lieu of fractional shares in connection with any such
conversion and may make payments on convertible Indebtedness in accordance with its terms;

(21) payments or distributions to dissenting stockholders pursuant to applicable law, pursuant to or in
connection with a consolidation, merger or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that complies with the covenant described
under the caption “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”;

(22) the conversion of any Subordinated Indebtedness to Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock)
of the Issuer or any Parent Entity, and any payment that is intended to prevent any Subordinated
Indebtedness from being treated as an “applicable high yield discount obligation” within the
meaning of Section 163(i)(1) of the Code;

(23) mandatory redemptions of Disqualified Stock issued as a Restricted Payment or as consideration for
a Permitted Investment;

(24) Investments or other Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed an amount equal to

(25) (i) the redemption, defeasance, repurchase, exchange or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated

Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Guarantor in an aggregate amount outstanding at the time made,
taken together with all other redemptions, defeasances, repurchases, exchanges or other acquisitions or
retirements of Subordinated Indebtedness made pursuant to this clause (25), not to exceed the greater of
$590.0 million and 30.0% of LTM EBITDA at such time, and (ii) the redemption, defeasance,
repurchase, exchange or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuers or
any Guarantor, so long as, immediately after giving pro forma effect to the payment of any such
Restricted Payment and the incurrence of any Indebtedness the net proceeds of which are used to make
such Restricted Payment, the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio shall be no greater than 5.50 to 1.00.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment
or Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of clauses (1) through (25) above or is entitled
to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition
of “Permitted Investments,” the Issuer will be entitled to divide, classify and subsequently divide and reclassify such
Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through (25) and such first paragraph
and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in a manner that otherwise
complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash


-----

Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property
or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating to an Investment, the
Issuer or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Investment as having occurred on the date of the
commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating thereto (such date, the “Election Date”) if, after giving pro
forma effect to such Investment and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related pro forma
adjustments, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment on
the relevant Election Date in compliance with the Indenture, and any related subsequent actual making of such
Investment will be deemed for all purposes under the Indenture to have been made on such Election Date, including
for purposes of calculating any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable) and
EBITDA or LTM EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or Event of Default (and
all such calculations on and after the Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing, rescission, retraction or
rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement or similar event shall be made on a pro forma basis giving
effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith).

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity
or any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer
will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries.

If the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such
Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the provisions of the
Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture
notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Issuer’s financial statements affecting
Consolidated Net Income or EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Issuer for any period.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of, or dividends or other distributions
in amounts sufficient to make, any “AHYDO catch-up payment” with respect to any Indebtedness of any Parent Entity,
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the Indenture.

**Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of
Disqualified Stock, and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness),
issue shares of Disqualified Stock and issue shares of Preferred Stock, if either (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
on a consolidated basis for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is
incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00, as if the
additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case
may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period, or (ii)
the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio would have been no greater than 6.50 to 1:00, in each case determined on a
_pro forma basis (including a_ _pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom but without giving effect to any_
simultaneous incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1)(b) in the second paragraph of this covenant); provided,
_however that, on a pro forma basis, together with any amounts incurred or issued, as applicable, and outstanding by_
Non-Guarantors pursuant to clause 12(b) and (14) of the following paragraph, no more than the greater of $1,955.0

outstanding and incurred or issued, as applicable, pursuant to this paragraph shall be incurred or issued, as applicable,
by Non-Guarantors; provided, further, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to Indebtedness of any
Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition or any other Investment not prohibited

incurrence of such additional amount and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the
Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio would be (i) no greater than 5.50 to 1.00 outstanding at any
one time, and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof or (ii) in the case of any such
Indebtedness incurred to finance any investment or acquisition or incurred as a result of Person

Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, equal to or less than
it was immediately prior to such acquisition or merger, in each case as of the date on which such
additional Indebtedness is incurred, determined on a _pro forma basis (including a_ _pro forma_
application of the net proceeds therefrom but without giving effect to any simultaneous incurrence
of Indebtedness pursuant to clause 1(b)); provided that for the purposes of determining the amount

clause (1) of the preceding paragraph and may not be reclassified;

(2) at the time of incurrence or reclassification, the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify or redivide or reclassify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described
in the first and second paragraphs above;

(3) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
Credit Facility, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and
including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) shall be
determined on the date of such Credit Facility or such increase in commitments (assuming that the
full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, test is
satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) shall be permitted
under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net
Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or
reborrowing thereunder (or the issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this
paragraph shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Debt Ratio, as applicable);

(4) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary incurs Indebtedness in connection with any
Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including
acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset
Sales) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, when calculating the availability under any
basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, at the option
of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of
determination for availability under any such basket or ratio, including the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, as
applicable, and whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition
therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event
of Default)) under the Indenture will, at the option of the Issuer, be deemed to be the date (the “LCT
_Test Date”) either (a) that a definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered_
into (or if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable declaration of a Restricted Payment or
similar event) or (b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the City Code applies, the
date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent
announcement in another jurisdiction) (an “LCT Public Offer”) in respect of a target of a Limited
Condition Transaction and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition
Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the
incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence
or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Sales) and any related pro forma
adjustments, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such
actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such
ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any
related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for
all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is committed,
issued, assumed or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); _provided that (a) if_
financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the
Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of
such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be the
applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated


-----

in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets (and any related requirements
and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for
such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related thereto (including
acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset
Sales) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will
be calculated using an assumed interest rate as reasonably determined by the Issuer.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets,
including the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Debt Ratio, as applicable, after giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments
and Asset Sales) and any related pro forma adjustments (A) if any such ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance
was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or
otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such ratio, test or basket (including due to
fluctuations in the EBITDA or Total Assets of the Issuer or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction),
such ratios, tests or baskets will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result
of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing
Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date
would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence
or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been
failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or
be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or
transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the
earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive
agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition
Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes
or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without
consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested
giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction;

(5) accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, or the reclassification of
commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP will not be
deemed to be an incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for
purposes of this covenant;

(6) for purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence
of Indebtedness, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving
credit debt; _provided_ that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness
denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollardenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
(i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of
fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with
such refinancing;

(7) the principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a
different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated
that is in effect on the date of such refinancing;


-----

(8) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, the amount of Indebtedness being incurred to finance
the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender
premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original
issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing will not be deemed
to be an incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant;

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred
to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant, measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM
EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums),
defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, costs, fees and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing;

(10) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the termination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(11) the Indenture will not treat (x) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured
Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (y) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to
any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same
collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors;

(12) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(13) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(14) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one
or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and (15)the amount of
Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the
amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

**Liens**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,
assume or permit to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, an “Initial Lien”) that secures Obligations under


-----

any Indebtedness or any related Guarantee, on any asset or property of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor,
unless:

(1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and related Note Guarantees are
secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens; or

(2) in all other cases, the Notes or the Note Guarantees are equally and ratably secured, except that the
foregoing shall not apply to Liens securing the Notes and the related Note Guarantees.

Any Lien created for the benefit of Holders of the Notes pursuant to this covenant shall provide by its terms
that such Lien will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of
the Initial Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of
the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original
issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets The Issuer**

The Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into, or sell, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all
its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving Person or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
_Company”) will be a Person organized or existing under the laws of the United Kingdom, a_
European Union member state, the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or the United States,
any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof, Canada, Norway, Switzerland
or Japan, and the Successor Company, if other than the Issuer, will expressly assume all the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents
or instruments;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing;

(3) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, either

(a) the applicable Successor Company or the Issuer would be permitted to incur at least $1.00
of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock,” or
(b) (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company or the Issuer and its
respective Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower than the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio for the Issuer immediately prior to such transaction or (ii) the Consolidated Total Net
Debt Ratio would not be higher than it was immediately prior to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures, if any,
comply with the Indenture; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (2) and (3)
above.


-----

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, and the Issuer will automatically and unconditionally be released and
discharged from its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of this section) shall not apply to the
creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

Any reference in the Indenture to a merger, consolidation, conveyance, disposal, assignment, sale or
disposition or similar term, shall be deemed to apply to a division of or by a limited liability company, corporation or
partnership, or an allocation of assets to a series of or one or more limited liability companies, partnerships or
corporations, or the unwinding of such a division or allocation, as if it were a merger, consolidation, conveyance,
disposal, assignment, sale or disposition, or similar term, as applicable, to, of or with a separate Person. Any division
of a limited liability company, corporation or partnership shall be deemed to constitute the formation of a separate
Person, and any such division shall constitute a separate Person under the Indenture (and each division of any limited
liability company, corporation or partnership that is a subsidiary, joint venture or any other like term shall also
constitute such a Person or entity).

**The Co-Issuer**

The Co-Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into, or sell, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially
all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) concurrently therewith, a corporate Wholly Owned Subsidiary that is a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer organized or existing under the laws of the United Kingdom, a European Union member state,
the jurisdiction of organization of the Co-Issuer or the United States, any state thereof, the District
of Columbia, or any territory thereof, Canada, Norway, Switzerland or Japan, is the Successor
Company and the Successor Company, if other than the Co-Issuer, expressly assumes all the
obligations of the Co-Issuer under the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents
or instruments, and if such Successor Company is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Notes is a
corporation organized or existing under such laws;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing; and

(3) the Co-Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures, if any,
comply with the Indenture; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clause (2) above.

**The Guarantors**

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Note Guarantee upon the sale,
disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor may consolidate or merge with or into, or sell, transfer, lease or
convey all or substantially all of its assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person (other than the Issuer,
the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor), unless:

(1) (a) the other Person is the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor
or becomes a Guarantor concurrently with the transaction; or either (x) the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or
a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly
assumes all the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and the Indenture; and
(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing; or

(2) with respect to the Guarantors, the transaction is not prohibited by the first paragraph of the covenant
described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”


-----

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be substituted for,
such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,

(1) the Issuer or the Co-Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or
part of its property or assets to the Co-Issuer (if it is not such entity) or a Guarantor;

(2) the Issuer or the Co-Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate of
the Issuer for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer or the Co-Issuer in another jurisdiction, or
changing the legal form of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer;

(3) any Guarantor may (i) consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of
its properties and assets to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or another Guarantor (or to a Restricted
Subsidiary if that Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor), (ii) consolidate or otherwise combine
with or merge into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Guarantor in another
jurisdiction of organization or changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor, (iii) convert into a
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability corporation or trust organized or
existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, (iv) consolidate or
amalgamate with or merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Restricted
Subsidiary that is neither a Guarantor nor a Co-Issuer so long as (A) to the extent constituting an
Investment, such Investment is otherwise permitted under the covenant described under the caption
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or (B) to the extent constituting an Asset Sale, such Asset
Sale is for fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) and any promissory note or
other non-cash consideration received in respect thereof is a permitted Investment in a Restricted
Subsidiary that is neither a Guarantor nor a Co-Issuer in accordance with the covenant described
under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” or (v) liquidate or dissolve or change its
legal form if the Issuer determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Issuer;

(4) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise
combine with or merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer, the CoIssuer (if it is not such Restricted Subsidiary) or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may consummate any Permitted Tax Restructuring; and

(6) the Transactions will be permitted without compliance with this “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
All or Substantially All Assets” covenant.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all
or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

A sale, lease or other disposition by the Issuer of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the
sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market value of
the assets retained by the Issuer exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes and any
other outstanding Indebtedness of the Issuer that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Notes with respect to such assets.
Such fair market value shall be established by the delivery to the Trustee of an independent expert’s certificate stating
the independent expert’s opinion of such fair market value as of a date not more than 90 days before or after such sale,
lease or other disposition. This paragraph is not intended to limit the Issuer’s sales, leases or other dispositions of less
than substantially all of its assets.


-----

**Transactions with Affiliates**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into or conduct any
transaction with any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
payments or consideration in excess of the greater of $200.0 million and 10.0% of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in
a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
$295.0 million and 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved by
a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause
(2) of this paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested
Directors of the Issuer, if any.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) transactions between or among the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary and/or any entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction, or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries
and (b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity; provided that such
Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash
Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is
otherwise permitted under the Indenture;

(2) Restricted Payments or other transactions permitted to be made or undertaken by the provisions of
the Indenture described above under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (including
Permitted Payments) and the definition of “Permitted Investments”;

(3) the payment of management, consulting, monitoring, refinancing, transaction, advisory, indemnities
and other fees, costs and expenses to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly), including
to its affiliates or its designees, pursuant to any management services or similar agreements or the
management services or other relevant provisions in an investor rights agreement, limited
partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or other equityholders’ agreement, as
the case may be, as in effect from time to time (plus any unpaid management, consulting,
monitoring, refinancing, transaction, advisory, indemnities and other fees, costs and expenses
accrued in any prior year) and any exit and termination fees (including any such cash lump sum or
present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate event, including an initial public offering)
pursuant to such agreement, in each case as in effect on the Issue Date or any amendment thereto or
replacement thereof (so long as any such amendment or replacement is not materially
disadvantageous, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, to the Holders
when taken as a whole as compared to the management services or similar agreements in effect
immediately prior to such amendment or replacement);

(4) the payment of fees, costs, compensation and expenses paid to, and indemnities (including under
insurance policies) and reimbursements, employment and severance arrangements and employee
benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, or for the benefit of, future, current or former
directors, employees, officers, managers, contractors, distributors, advisors or consultants (or their
respective Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Issuer, any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or any Parent Entity (whether directly or indirectly and including through
their Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members);


-----

(5) transactions in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to
the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view meet the requirements of clause
(1) of the preceding paragraph;

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding,
any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Issue Date, or any amendment, modification,
supplement, extension, renewal, refinancing or replacement thereof in accordance with the other
terms of this covenant or so long as any such amendment, modification, supplement, extension,
renewal, refinancing or replacement is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders
when taken as a whole as compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the Issue Date and
performance of obligations thereunder;

(7) the existence of, or the performance, by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its
obligations under the terms of, any equityholders, investor rights or similar agreement (including
any registration rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to which it is a party as of
the Issue Date and any similar agreements which it (or any Parent Entity) may enter into thereafter;
_provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted_
Subsidiaries (or any Parent Entity) of obligations under any future amendment to any such existing
agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted
by this clause (7) to the extent that the terms of any such existing agreement together with all
amendments thereto are not otherwise more disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders
when taken as a whole than those in effect on the Issue Date;

(8) transactions with customers, vendors, clients, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners,
distributors or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice or industry practice, and which are fair to the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the Issuer, or are on terms, taken as a
whole, that are not materially less favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time
from an unaffiliated party;

(9) (a) the issuance, transfer or sale of (a) Equity Interests or other payments, awards or grants in cash,
securities or otherwise to any Parent Entity, Permitted Holder or to any future, current or former

as required under applicable law;

which payments are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith or
a majority of the disinterested directors of the Issuer in good faith;

(12) payments, Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock (and cancellation of any thereof) of the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries and Preferred Stock (and cancellation of any thereof) of any Restricted
Subsidiary to any future, current or former employee, director, officer, manager, contractor,

equity plan or stock option plan, phantom equity plan or any other management or employee benefit


-----

and any employment agreements, termination or severance agreement, stock option plans and other
compensatory arrangements (and any successor plans thereto) and any supplemental executive

therewith) so long as the investment is being offered generally to other investors on the same or
more favorable terms and (b) payments to Affiliates in respect of securities or loans of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries contemplated in the foregoing subclause (a) or that were acquired
from Persons other than the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, in accordance with
the terms of such securities or loans;

(14) transactions with a Person (including a joint venture or an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that is an
Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity solely because the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted
Holder owns an Equity Interest in or controls such Person;

of the Notes and the Secured Notes), including the payment of fees, costs and expenses, including
Transaction Costs;

respective officers and employees in the ordinary course of business or otherwise in connection with
the Transactions (including loans and advances pursuant to clause (16) of the definition of Permitted
Investments);

(17) payments by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or pursuant to any tax sharing agreement or
arrangement among any Parent Entity, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on customary terms

restriction does not extend to any assets or property of the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary
other than the assets and property of such Subsidiary;

(t) any encumbrance or restriction contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security

restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the
good faith judgment of the Issuer, no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders with
respect to such encumbrance and other restrictions taken as a whole than those prior to such
amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or
refinancing.

**Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Issuer will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries, and, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, Foreign Subsidiaries organized in Luxembourg and the United Kingdom, in each case, that are
Restricted Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned Domestic
Subsidiaries guarantee other capital markets debt securities of the Issuer in a principal amount in excess of the greater
of $200.0 million and 10.0% of LTM EBITDA), other than the Co-Issuer, a Guarantor, a Receivables Subsidiary or a
Foreign Subsidiary that is not organized in Luxembourg or the United Kingdom, to guarantee the payment of (i) any
syndicated Credit Facility permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under the
caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or
(ii) capital markets debt securities of the Issuer, Co-Issuer or any other Guarantor, in each case, unless such Restricted
Subsidiary within 60 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Note
Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer, the CoIssuer or any Guarantor (x) if the Notes are subordinated in right of payment to such Indebtedness, the Note Guarantee
under the supplemental indenture shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee with respect to such
Indebtedness substantially to the same extent as the Notes are subordinated to such Indebtedness and (y) if such
Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee,
any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of
payment to such Note Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or
such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee; _provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to (i) any guarantee of any_
Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in
connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) guarantees of any
Receivables Facility by any Receivables Subsidiary and (iii) in the event that the Note Guarantee of the Issuers’
obligations under the Notes or the Indenture by such Subsidiary would not be permitted under applicable law or
regulatory authority. The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause or allow, as the case may be, any Subsidiary
or any of its Parent Entities that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such
Subsidiary or Parent Entity shall not be required to comply with the 60 day period described above and such Note
Guarantee may be released at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion so long as any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
or Parent Entity then outstanding could have been incurred by such Subsidiary or Parent Entity (either (x) when so
incurred or (y) at the time of the release of such Note Guarantee) assuming such Subsidiary or Parent Entity were not
a Guarantor at such time.

If any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, the Issuer shall have the right, by delivery of a
supplemental indenture executed by the Issuer to the Trustee, to cause such Immaterial Subsidiary to automatically
and unconditionally cease to be a Guarantor, subject to the requirement described in the first paragraph above that
such Subsidiary shall be required to become a Guarantor if it ceases to be an Immaterial Subsidiary (except that if
such Subsidiary has been properly designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary it shall not be so required to become a
Guarantor or execute a supplemental indenture); _provided, further, that such Immaterial Subsidiary shall not be_


-----

permitted to Guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing
2027 Unsecured Notes or other Indebtedness of the Issuers or the other Guarantors, unless it again becomes a
Guarantor.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Note
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference under applicable law,
including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law or
provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a
court, under certain circumstances, to avoid the notes offered hereby and the guarantees, and the liens securing the
secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes offered hereby, the
guarantees and the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees and/or require holders
of the notes offered hereby to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens in respect
of the secured notes offered hereby and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes offered hereby”
and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
Guarantees and Security Interests.”

**Reports**

The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee,

2022 and June 30, 2022, on or before the date that is 90 days after the end of such fiscal quarter (or
if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day)), beginning with the first
such fiscal quarter ending after the Issue Date, the financial statements of the Issuer for such quarter
prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to such financial statements

Current Report on Form 8-K (as in effect on the Issue Date) filed with the SEC by the Issuer (if the
Issuer were required to prepare and file such form) but subject to exceptions consistent with the
presentation of information in the Offering Circular; provided, that the foregoing shall not obligate
the Issuer to make available (i) any information regarding the occurrence of any of the following
events if the Issuer determines in its reasonable determination that such event that would otherwise
be required to be disclosed is not material to the Holders or the business, assets, operations, financial


-----

positions or prospects of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) an exhibit
or a summary of the terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement, agreement, plan or
understanding between the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries and any director, manager or executive
officer of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) copies of any agreements, financial statements
or other items that would be required to be filed as exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K or

(g) non-reliance on previously issued financial statements; and

(h) change of control transactions.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, for so long as the Notes remain subject to this
paragraph (a), the Issuer will furnish to Holders thereof and prospective investors in such Notes, upon their request,
the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) (as in effect on the Issue Date) of the Securities
Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be required to provide (i) segment reporting and
disclosure (including any required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280), (ii) separate financial
statements or other information contemplated by Rules 3-03(e), 3-05, 3-09, 3-10, 3-16 or 4-08 of Regulation S-X (or
any successor provisions) or any schedules required by Regulation S-X, (iii) information required by Regulation G
under the Exchange Act or Item 10, Item 302, Item 402 or Item 601 of Regulation S-K (or any successor provision),
(iv) XBRL exhibits, (v) earnings per share information, (vi) information regarding executive compensation and related
party disclosure related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A, 34-54302A and IC-27444A, and (vii) other information
customarily excluded from an offering memorandum, including any information that is not otherwise of the type and
form currently included in the Offering Circular relating to the Notes. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Issuer will not be required to (i) comply with Sections 302, 906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any information, certificates or reports required by Items 307 or 308 of Regulation
S-K (or any successor provision). To the extent any such information is not so filed or furnished, as applicable, within
the time periods specified above and such information is subsequently filed or furnished, as applicable, the Issuer will
be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall
be deemed to have been cured; provided that such cure shall not otherwise affect the rights of the Holders under “—
Events of Default” if Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have declared
the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the outstanding Notes to be due and
payable immediately and such declaration shall not have been rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure.

The requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs may be satisfied by (i) delivering such information
electronically to the Trustee and (ii) the Issuer using commercially reasonable efforts to post copies of such
information on a website (which may be nonpublic and may be maintained by the Issuer or a third party) to which
access will be given to Holders and prospective purchasers of the Notes (which prospective purchasers will be limited


-----

to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as
defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Issuer. To the extent the Issuer determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner
described in the preceding sentence after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, the Issuer shall furnish such
reports to the Holders, upon their request. The Issuer may condition the delivery of any such reports to such Holders
and prospective purchasers of the Notes on the agreement of such Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the
information contained there) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports (and the information contained
therein) and information for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not
publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein) and information.

The Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial
information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; _provided that the_
same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the
information relating to such Parent Entity, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information
referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited.

The obligations under this covenant may be satisfied by having the applicable entity furnish reports
containing the information contemplated hereby to the Holders of the Notes or filed reports containing the information
contemplated hereby with the SEC.

If the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph
of this covenant will include a presentation of selected financial metrics (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) of such
Unrestricted Subsidiaries as a group in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.”

Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee under the Indenture is for informational
purposes only and the information and the Trustee’s receipt of the foregoing shall not constitute actual or constructive
notice of any information contained therein, or determinable from information contained therein including the Issuer’s
compliance with any of its covenants thereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officer’s
Certificate). The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze reports delivered to it.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer will not be deemed to have failed to comply with
any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under the caption “Events of Default and Remedies” until
180 days after the date any report hereunder is due.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default with respect to the Notes:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal
of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given
by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements
(other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes;
provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall
be 270 days after written notice described in this clause has been given;


-----

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there
is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,
whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the Issue Date, if both:

(a) such default either (i) results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at
its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or (ii) results
in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving
effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates to the greater of $685.0 million and 35.0% of LTM EBITDA or more at any
one time outstanding;

(5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final non-appealable
judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of $685.0 million and 35.0% of LTM EBITDA (net
of amounts covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable
companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more
than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by
insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or
decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary
(or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary); or

(7) the Note Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force and
effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Note
Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture (including the Agreed Security Principles).

However, a Default under clause (3), (4) or (5) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuers of the Default
and, with respect to clauses (3) and (5), the Issuers do not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (3) or
(5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to
any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice
of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or
take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”)
must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuers and the Trustee that
such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by
beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a
Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default (a “Default Direction”) shall be deemed a
continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are
accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant
to provide the Issuers with such other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to
verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a
“Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or
Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its


-----

nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant
in delivering its direction to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers
determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuers have
initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such
time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the
cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a
final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery
of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers provide to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to
such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from
the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of
such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in
such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes
held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide
such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing
Holder may have offered the Trustee), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have
occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any
notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding
shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction
delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any
Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s
Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative
Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall
have no liability to the Issuers, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the
Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuers or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of
the then total outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may declare the principal of and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the
effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable
immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of
this section occurs and is continuing, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or
notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default,
except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding
notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes. Any time period in
the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate
in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted
solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of
Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—
Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.


-----

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive all past or
any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in the
payment of interest or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration with
respect to the Notes and its consequences; provided such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction. If any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, such
Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of
acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee
or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged;

(2) Holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be)
giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the
Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no
Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders of the Notes have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or
security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however,
may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being
understood that the Trustee shall have no duty to determine whether an action is prejudicial to a minority holder).

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end
of each fiscal year, a statement regarding whether the signer thereof knows of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written
notice of any Default, its status and what actions the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. The
Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event,
which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice
references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “notice of default.”


-----

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or stockholder of the
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent Entities or Affiliates shall have any liability, for any obligations of the Issuer,
the Co-Issuer or the Guarantors under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver
and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer and the Guarantors under the Note Documents will terminate
(other than certain obligations) and all then existing Defaults and Events of Default will be cured and the Issuer, the
Co-Issuer and the Guarantors will be released upon payment of principal and interest on the Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be. The Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have all of their obligations
discharged with respect to the Notes and have the Issuer’s, the Co-Issuer’s and each Guarantor’s obligation discharged
with respect to its Note Guarantee (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the
Indenture;

(2) the Issuers’ obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of
such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency
for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuers’ obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have their obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and
thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default with respect to the Notes. In the
event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and
insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under the caption “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no
longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

(1) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as
agent) by the Issuers for this purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in
Dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient to
pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes on the Stated Maturity date or
on the Redemption Date, as the case may be; provided that, upon any redemption that requires the
payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by the Issuers for this purpose) equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as
of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such
amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or
prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the deposit of such Applicable
Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such
redemption;


-----

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuers have received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or
(b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal
income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain
or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial holders
of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to such Tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not
occurred;

(4) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was
not made by the Issuers with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors
of the Issuers; and

(5) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
(which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes (except as to surviving
rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and the rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Indenture),
when either:

(1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have
been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust
or released, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a)all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable
by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due and payable within
one year or may be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the
Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the
Issuers and the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor have deposited or caused to be deposited with
the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Issuers for this purpose)
solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, money in Dollars, Government Securities or a
combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment
of interest to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity
or redemption; _provided that, upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable_
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that
an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date
of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited
with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set


-----

forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the
deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit
shall be applied toward such redemption;

(b) the Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by them under the Indenture;
and
(c) the Issuers have delivered instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward
the payment of the Notes at maturity or the Redemption Date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuers must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1) and
(2)).

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as otherwise provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Note Documents may be amended,
supplemented or modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding, including consents obtained before or after a Change of Control or in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes, and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any
provision thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the then outstanding Notes (including consents obtained before or after a Change of Control or in connection with
a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes).

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder of Notes, an amendment or
waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating
to Change of Control and Asset Sales) or reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any
such Note or change the time at which any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described
above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(3) reduce the rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note (other than provisions
relating to Change of Control and Asset Sales);

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal of or premium, if
any, or interest on the Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration;

(5) make any Note payable in currency other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions which required the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence;

(7) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of
and interest on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor; and

(8) make any change to or modify the ranking of such Notes that would adversely affect the Holders.


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to a Note Guarantee or
the Indenture to which it is a party), the Trustee and the other parties thereto, as the case may be, may amend or
supplement any Note Documents without the consent of any Holder to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency or reduce the minimum
denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or to alter the
provisions of the Indenture relating to the form of the Notes (including related definitions);

(3) comply with the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Merger,
Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”;

(4) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the Issuer’s, Co-Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s
obligations under any Note Document;

(5) make any change (including changing the CUSIP or other identifying number on any Notes) that
would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not materially and
adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) add or modify covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders;

(7) at the Issuers’ election, comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the
qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee
or successor Paying Agent thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the
accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;

(9) provide for the issuance of exchange notes or private exchange notes, which are identical to
exchange notes except that they are not freely transferable;

(10) add a Guarantor or a co-obligor of the Notes under the Indenture;

(11) conform the text of the Note Documents to any provision of this “Description of Unsecured Notes”;

(12) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance and
administration of the Notes; _provided,_ _however, that such amendment does not materially and_
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;

(13) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under the caption “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” to add Note Guarantees with respect to the
Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the
Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture;

(14) make such provisions as necessary for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(15) comply with the rules and procedures of any applicable securities depositary; and


-----

(16) make any amendment to the provisions of the Note Documents to eliminate the effect of any
Accounting Change or in the application thereof as described in the last paragraph of the definition
of “GAAP.”

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection
with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under the caption
“—Certain Covenants,” or action taken in compliance with the covenants in effect at the time of such action, shall be
deemed to impair or affect any legal rights of any Holders of the Notes to receive payment of principal of or premium,
if any, or interest on the Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such
Holder’s Notes.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as any Notes are
represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give
such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests. To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of DTC conflict
with any such requirements, a notice will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of the Indenture if it complies with
the mandatory rules and procedures of DTC.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the earlier of such publication and the fifth day after being so mailed.
Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent
means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to electronically
deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to
other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed in the manner provided above, it is
duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given through DTC, it is duly
given on the day the notice is given to DTC.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Wilmington Trust, National Association is the Trustee under the Indenture.

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a
creditor of the Issuers, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect
of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the
Issuer, the Co-Issuer and their respective Affiliates.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising
any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that, except during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such
Indenture. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall occur and be known to the Trustee (which
shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture,
to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of such person’s own affairs. The Trustee will be under
no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of the Notes,
unless such Holder shall have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to
the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.


-----

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuers and (2) that
if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain
minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or
becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuers may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on a ratio basket based on the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Debt ratio, such
ratio(s) shall be calculated with respect to such incurrence, issuance or other transaction without giving effect to
amounts being utilized under any other basket (other than a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio) on the same date. Each item of
Indebtedness that is incurred or issued, each Lien incurred and each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to
have been incurred, issued or taken first, to the extent available, pursuant to the relevant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio test.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof)
is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on a ratio basket based on a

The Indenture shall provide that any calculation or measure that is determined with reference to the Issuer’s
financial statements (including EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Income, Fixed Charges,
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio and Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio) may be
determined with reference to the financial statements of a Parent Entity instead, so long as such Parent Entity does not
hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the Capital Stock of the Issuer.

For purposes of making the computation referred to in the paragraph above, Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansion and disposed or
discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) that have been made by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior
to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro _forma basis_


-----

assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational
changes, business expansion and disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge
obligations and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference
period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
merged or amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period
shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change,
business expansion or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this
definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period
as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business
expansion or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (subject to the
threshold specified in the previous sentence).

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction (including the
Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer
of the Issuer (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating improvements, synergies and
expense reductions which is being given pro forma effect). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is
being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any
Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to
accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the
rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the
computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period except
as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an
interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall
be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as
the Issuer may designate.

“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum, without duplication, of:

opinions and pronouncements of the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public

statements by such other entity as have been approved by a significant segment of the accounting profession, which
are in effect from time to time; provided that all terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Indenture shall
be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Indenture shall be made (a) without giving
effect to any election under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825—Financial Instruments, or any successor
thereto or comparable accounting principle (including pursuant to the Accounting Standards Codification), to value
any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein and (b) the amount of any
Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations shall be determined in accordance with the
definition of Capitalized Lease Obligations. At any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect to apply IFRS
accounting principles in lieu of GAAP and, upon any such election, references herein to GAAP shall thereafter be
construed to mean IFRS (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture); provided that any such election, once made,
shall be irrevocable; provided, further, any calculation or determination in the Indenture that requires the application


-----

of GAAP for periods that include fiscal quarters ended prior to the Issuer’s election to apply IFRS shall remain as
previously calculated or determined in accordance with GAAP. The Issuer shall give notice of any such election made
in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an election (without any
other action) referred to in this definition will not be treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness.

If there occurs a change in IFRS or GAAP, as the case may be, and such change would cause a change in the
method of calculation of any standards, terms or measures used in the Indenture (an “Accounting Change”), then the
Issuer may elect that such standards, terms or measures shall be calculated as if such Accounting Change had or had
not occurred.

a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act), as custodian with respect to any such

Securities held by such custodian for the account of the holder of such depository receipt; provided
that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the

statement conditions or otherwise); or

(2) entered into primarily for purposes of assuring in any other manner the obligee of such Indebtedness
of the payment thereof or to protect such obligee against loss in respect thereof (in whole or in part);

deposit in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice and (y) standard
contractual indemnities or product warranties provided in the ordinary course of business, and

Guarantee is made and (ii) the maximum amount for which such guaranteeing Person may be liable
pursuant to the terms of the instrument embodying such Guarantee or, if such Guarantee is not an
unconditional guarantee of the entire amount of the primary obligation and such maximum amount

convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and
are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to
contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New
York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing
agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold
securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks,


-----

trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to
other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who
are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the
Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on
behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the USD Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the

initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the USD Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in the USD Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of

these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants)
or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in
the USD Global Notes).

Investors in the USD Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their
interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the USD Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may
hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are
Participants in DTC. All interests in the USD Global Notes may be subject to the procedures and requirements of
DTC. Investors in the USD Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or
Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After
the issue date, investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC
system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global
Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books
of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of Euroclear, and Clearstream
Banking, S.A., as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the
depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a USD Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream
may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements
of DTC). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities
that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those
requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on
behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those
interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests,
may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests.

Except as described below, beneficial owners of an interest in the USD Global Notes will not have USD
notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of dollar notes in registered certificated form
(“Certificated USD Notes”) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the
indentures governing the USD notes for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of and premium and interest on a USD Global Note registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture
governing the USD notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the USD notes, the applicable issuers and the
Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including the USD Global Notes, are registered as the owners
of such USD notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the
applicable issuers, the Trustee or any agent of the applicable issuers or the Trustee has or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments

made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the USD Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the
beneficial ownership interests in the USD Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect

Participants.


-----

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as
the USD notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the
payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date.
Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the
principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the
Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of the USD notes will be governed by standing instructions and
customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the
responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the applicable issuers. Neither the issuers nor the Trustee will be liable for any
delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any the USD notes, and the applicable
issuers and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its
nominee for all purposes.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of USD notes only at the
direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests of the USD Global Notes and
only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the USD note as to which such Participant or
Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the dollar notes, DTC
reserves the right to exchange the USD Global Notes for legended USD notes in certificated form, and to distribute
such dollar notes to its Participants.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in
DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand,
will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and
procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective
depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant
Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds
settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions
directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the
direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only
in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those
Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes
to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those
procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time.

Neither the issuers nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**_Exchange of USD Global Notes for Certificated USD Notes_**

A USD Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated USD Note if:

  - DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global Notes
or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a successor
depositary is not appointed;


-----

  - we at our option, notify, the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes; or

  - there has occurred and is continuing a Default or event of default with respect to the USD Global Notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a USD Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior
written notice given to the applicable issuers and the Registrar by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the
indentures governing the notes. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or
beneficial interests in a Global Note will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations,
requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the
applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable
law.

**_Exchange of Certificated USD Notes for USD Global Notes_**

If Certificated USD Notes are issued in the future, they will not be exchangeable for beneficial interests in
any USD Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the issuers and the Registrar a written certificate (in the
form provided in the indentures governing the notes) to the effect that the transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to the notes being transferred. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Exchanges Among USD Global Notes_**

Beneficial interests in a USD Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in a USD
Rule 144A Global Note only if:

  - the exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the relevant notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

  - the transferor first delivers to the issuers and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the
indentures governing the notes) to the effect that the notes are being transferred:

    - to a Person who (i) the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the
meaning of Rule 144A and (ii) is purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified
institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

    - in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a USD Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in
the form of an interest in the USD Regulation S Global Note, only if the transferor first delivers to the issuers and
the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the indentures governing the notes offered hereby) to the
effect that the transfer is being made in accordance with the applicable transfer restrictions. See “Transfer
Restrictions.”

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a USD Regulation S Global Note and a USD
Rule 144A Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC Participant
through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer,
appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the USD Regulation S
Global Note and the USD Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the USD Global
Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another USD Global Note will,
upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such USD Global Note and will become an interest in such other USD
Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to
beneficial interest in such other USD Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

**_Same Day Settlement and Payment_**

We will make payments in respect of the dollar notes represented by the USD Global Notes, including
payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified by the USD Global Note Holder. We will make all payments of principal of and premium, if any, with


-----

respect to the Certificated USD Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by
the Holders of the Certificated USD Notes or, if no account is specified, by mailing a check to each Holder’s
registered address. The USD notes represented by the USD Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in
DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such USD notes
represented will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. We expect that
secondary trading in any Certified USD Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time
zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global
Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or
Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear
and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised us that cash received in
Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the
relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following
DTC’s settlement date.

**The Non-USD Global Notes**

**_General_**

The Non-USD Global Notes will be deposited, on the issue date, with the Common Depositary and registered in
the name of the Common Depositary or a nominee of the Common Depositary for the account of Euroclear and
Clearstream. All the euro secured notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. All the sterling secured notes will be issued in
registered, global form in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.
The euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against
payment in immediately available funds. Except as set forth below, the Non-USD Global Notes may be transferred,
in whole and not in part, only to a Common Depositary for Clearstream and Euroclear or its nominee. The euro
secured notes and the sterling secured notes will not be eligible for clearance with DTC. No link is expected to be
established among DTC and Clearstream or Euroclear in connection with the issuance of the euro secured notes and
the sterling secured notes.

Ownership of interests in the Non-USD Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Non-USD Rule 144A Book Entry
Interests”) and ownership of interests in the Non-USD Regulation S Global Notes (the “Non-USD Regulation S
Book Entry Interests” and together with the Non-USD Rule 144A Book Entry Interests, the “Non-USD Book Entry
Interests”), will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold
interests through such Participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Non-USD Global Notes on
behalf of their Participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Non-USD Book Entry Interests
will not be issued in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry
registration and transfer systems a Participant’s account with the book-entry interest beneficially owned by such
Participant.

Non-USD Book Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their Participants. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain States of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own,
transfer or pledge Non-USD Book Entry Interests. In addition, while the euro secured notes are in global form,
holders of Euro Book Entry Interests will not be considered holders of euro secured notes or sterling secured notes
for any purpose.

So long as the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Non-USD
Global Notes for all purposes under the indentures that will govern the euro secured notes and the sterling secured
notes. In addition, Participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and Indirect Participants
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the Participants through which they own Non-USD
Book Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of euro secured notes or sterling


-----

secured notes under the indentures that will govern the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes, as
applicable.

Neither the issuers, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of
the records relating to the Non-USD Book Entry Interests, nor the action or inaction of Euroclear, Clearstream or
any common depositary.

We have obtained the information in this section, “Book Entry, Delivery and Form,” concerning Clearstream
and Euroclear and the book-entry system and procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we take no
responsibility for the accuracy of this information.

**_Definitive Registered Non-USD Notes_**

Under the terms of the indentures that will govern the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes, owners
of the Non-USD Book Entry Interests will receive euro secured notes or sterling secured notes in certificated form
(the “Definitive Registered Non-USD Notes”), (1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the issuers that it is unwilling
or unable to continue to act as depositary for the Non-USD Global Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed
by the issuers, (2) if the issuers, at their option, notify the Trustee and the applicable paying agent in writing that it
elects to cause the issuance of Definitive Registered Non-USD Notes or (3) if the owner of a Non-USD Book Entry
Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default
and commencement of enforcement action under the indentures that will govern the euro secured notes and the
**sterling secured notes.**

We understand that upon request by an owner of a Non-USD Book Entry Interest described in the immediately
preceding clause (3), Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s current procedure would be to request that we issue or cause to
be issued euro secured notes and/or sterling secured notes, as applicable, in definitive registered form to all owners
of Non-USD Book Entry Interests.

In such an event, we will issue Definitive Registered Non-USD Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the issuers, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
Participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Non-USD Book Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered
Non-USD Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the indentures that will govern the euro secured notes
and the sterling secured notes, unless that legend is not required by the indentures that will govern the euro secured
notes and/pre the sterling secured notes or applicable law.

Should Definitive Registered Non-USD Notes be issued to individual holders of the euro secured notes and the
**sterling secured notes, a holder of euro secured notes and/or sterling secured notes who, as a result of trading or**
otherwise, holds a principal amount of euro secured notes and/or sterling secured notes that is less than the minimum
denomination of the euro secured notes and/or sterling secured notes, as applicable, would be required to purchase
an additional principal amount of euro secured notes and/or sterling secured notes, as applicable such that its holding
of euro secured notes and/or sterling secured notes, as applicable, amounts to the minimum specified denomination.

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee and the applicable paying agent each shall be entitled to treat
the registered holder of any Non-USD Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for
treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Non-USD Global Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing
title to the notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the euro secured notes or the sterling secured notes;
however, owners of the Non-USD Book Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the
maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**_Redemption of the Non-USD Global Notes_**

In the event that any Non-USD Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will distribute the amount received by them, in respect of the Non-USD Global Note so redeemed, to


-----

the holders of the Euro Book-Entry Interests in such Non-USD Global Note from the amount received by them in
respect of the redemption of such Non-USD Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the
redemption of such Non-USD Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Non-USD Global Note (or any portion
thereof).

The issuers understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the
euro secured notes and/or the sterling secured notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will
credit their Participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such
other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Non-USD Book Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**_Payments on Non-USD global notes_**

The issuers will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Non-USD Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, and interest) to the applicable paying agent, and such paying agent will, in turn, make
such payments to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream who will distribute such
payments to Participants in accordance with their customary procedures. All payments of principal and interest on
the euro secured notes and/or the sterling secured notes, as applicable by or on behalf of the issuers will be made
free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or
other governmental charge (and any interest, penalties and additions with respect thereto) unless required by
applicable law or the official interpretation or administration thereof. The issuers expect that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by Participants to owners of Non-USD Book Entry
Interests held through such Participants.

Under the terms of the indentures that will govern the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes, the
issuers, the Trustee and any agent of ours or the Trustee will treat the registered holders of the Non-USD Global
Notes (i.e., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the issuers, the Trustee, any paying agent or
any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any Participant or Indirect Participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Non-USD Book Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any Participant or Indirect Participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Non-USD Book Entry Interest;

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any Participant or Indirect Participant; or

    - the records of the Common Depositary.

Payments by Participants to owners of Non-USD Book Entry Interests held through Participants are the
responsibility of such Participants.

**_Action by Owners of Book Entry Interests_**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the issuers that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of euro secured notes (including the presentation of euro secured notes for exchange as described above)
and/or sterling secured notes (including the presentation of sterling secured notes for exchange as described above)
only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account the Non-USD Book Entry Interests in the NonUSD Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of euro secured
notes and/or sterling secured notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction.
Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents or waivers or the taking of any
other action in respect of the Non-USD Global Notes.

However, if there is an event of default and commencement of enforcement action under the indentures that will
govern the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders
of the euro secured notes or the sterling secured notes, as applicable, reserve the right to exchange the Non-USD


-----

Global Notes for Definitive Registered Non-USD Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Non-USD
Notes to their respective Participants.

**_Transfers_**

Transfers between Participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of euro secured notes or sterling
secured notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Non-USD Notes for any reason, including to sell
euro secured notes or sterling secured notes, as applicable, to persons in jurisdictions which require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interests in the Non-USD Global
Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the indentures that will govern the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes, as
applicable.

The euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer
Restrictions.” Non-USD Book Entry Interests in the Non-USD Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on
transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.” Transfers of Non-USD Book Entry
Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Non-USD Book Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such
transfer restrictions. Book entry interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and
certification requirements discussed under “Plan of Distribution.”

Non-USD Rule 144A Book Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Non-USD Regulation S Book Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form to be provided in the indentures that will govern the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any
other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Non-USD Regulation S Book Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of a
Non-USD Rule 144A Book Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
to be provided in the indentures that will govern the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes) to the effect
that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional
buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Non-USD Regulation S Book Entry Interest for a NonUSD Rule 144A Book Entry Interest or an exchange of a Non-USD Rule 144A Book Entry Interest for a Non-USD
Regulation S Book Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount
of the Non-USD Regulation S Global Note or Non-USD Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable, and a corresponding
increase in the principal amount of the Non-USD Rule 144A Global Note or Non-USD Regulation S Global Note, as
applicable.

Definitive Registered Non-USD Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Non-USD Book Entry Interests in
a Non-USD Global Note only in accordance with the provisions of the indentures that will govern the euro secured
notes and the sterling secured notes, as applicable, and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee
a written certificate (in the form to be provided in the indentures that will govern the euro secured notes and the
**sterling secured notes, as applicable) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer**
restrictions applicable to such euro secured notes or such sterling secured notes, as applicable. See “Transfer
Restrictions.”

Any Non-US Book Entry Interest is one of the Non-USD Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes
delivery in the form of a Non-USD Book Entry Interest in any other Non-USD Global Note will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Non-USD Book Entry Interest in the first mentioned Non-USD Global Note and become a Non-USD
Book Entry Interest in such other Non-USD Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Non-USD Book Entry Interests in such other Non-USD
Global Note for as long as it remains such a Non-USD Book Entry Interest.


-----

**_Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream_**

All Non-USD Book Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement
system and may be changed at any time. Neither the issuers, the Trustee, any paying agent or the initial purchasers is
responsible for those operations or procedures.

The issuers understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their Participants through electronic book entry changes in the accounts of such Participants, thereby
eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to
their Participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.

Euroclear and Clearstream Participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also
available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream Participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of Participants, who in turn act on behalf of Indirect
Participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery
of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge
Non-USD Book Entry Interests. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream
systems will receive distributions attributable to the Non-USD Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
Participants.

**_Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book Entry System_**

The issuers understand that transfers of interests in the Non-USD Global Notes between Participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Non-USD Global Notes among Participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation
to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any
time. Neither the issuers, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by
Euroclear, Clearstream or their Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules
and procedures governing their operations.

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes through Clearstream and Euroclear
systems on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days
when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving
Clearstream and Euroclear systems on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to
transfer their interests in the euro secured notes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of the euro secured
notes and/or the sterling secured notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until
the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether the Clearstream or Euroclear system is
used.

**_Initial Settlement_**


-----

Initial settlement for the euro secured notes will be made in euros. Initial settlement for the sterling secured
notes will be made in pounds sterling. Non-USD Book Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Non-USD Book
Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders of notes on
the Business Day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary_** **_Market Trading_**

The Non-USD Book Entry Interests will trade through Participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle
in same day funds. The issuers understand that, since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Non-USD Book Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s
accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Notices_**

So long as the Non-USD Global Notes are held on behalf of a clearing system, notices required to be given
to Holders may be deemed to be given by the delivery of such notice to that clearing system on the date of delivery to
such clearing system.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the notes to U.S. holders and, solely with respect to the USD secured notes tranche 1
and the unsecured notes, non-U.S. holders (each as defined below and collectively referred to as “holders”), but does
not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential United States federal income tax considerations. This summary
is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), United States Treasury regulations (“Treasury
Regulations”) promulgated thereunder, published administrative positions of the United States Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed or subject
to new interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences
different from those summarized below. We have not sought, and do not expect to seek, any ruling from the IRS with
respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance
that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge
by the IRS in the event of litigation. Moreover, this summary does not address any United States federal non-income
(including estate or gift), state, local or non-United States tax considerations, the Medicare tax imposed on certain net
investment income or considerations under any applicable tax treaty.

This summary applies only to holders (1) that purchase notes in this offering for cash at the initial offering
price at which a substantial amount of the notes of the applicable series are sold for cash to persons other than bond
houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers (which is assumed for purposes of this summary to be the initial offering price of the applicable series set
forth on the cover page of this offering circular) and (2) that will hold the notes as “capital assets” within the meaning
of section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary is general in nature and does not
purport to deal with all aspects of United States federal income taxation that might be relevant to particular holders in
light of their personal circumstances or status (for example, U.S. holders subject to the alternative minimum tax) or
special rules that may apply to certain holders such as: banks and certain other financial institutions; former citizens
or residents of the United States; insurance companies; regulated investment companies; brokers, dealers or traders in
securities or currencies; “controlled foreign corporations;” “passive foreign investment companies;” corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; partnerships and other pass-through entities and
investors in such entities; S corporations; traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting
for their securities holdings; U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; U.S. holders who hold
notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary; tax-exempt entities; persons holding the notes as part
of a “straddle,” conversion transaction, integrated transaction, constructive sale transaction, hedge or hedging
transaction; persons deemed to sell the notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code; persons purchasing
or selling notes as part of a wash sale for tax purposes; entities subject to the anti-inversion rules; taxpayers required
to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to a note as a result of such income being
reported on an applicable financial statement; taxpayers subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax; and taxpayers
who are members of an “expanded group” or “modified expanded group” with the issuer within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations under section 385 of the Code.

In the case of a beneficial owner of notes that is classified as a partnership for United States federal income
tax purposes, the tax treatment of the purchase, ownership and disposition of notes to a partner in the partnership
generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.
Partnerships considering an investment in the notes and partners therein are urged to consult their tax advisors as to
the particular United States federal income tax consequences applicable to them.

The following discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning
and advice. Potential investors considering the purchase of notes are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning
the particular United States federal income tax consequences to them of the purchase, disposition and ownership of
notes, as well as any tax consequences arising under any other United States federal tax laws or the laws of any state,
local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.


-----

**Source of Interest**

Although the issuers are co-issuing the notes, the net proceeds of the USD secured notes tranche 1 and the
unsecured notes will be received and used by, and all payments due on such notes are expected to be paid by, the
Allied issuer, whereas the net proceeds of the USD secured notes tranche 2, the euro secured notes and the sterling
secured notes will be received and used by, and all payments due on such notes are expected to be paid by, the LuxCo
co-issuer. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the issuers intend to treat the USD secured notes tranche 1 and the
unsecured notes as being issued by the Allied issuer and interest on such notes as U.S. source, and treat the USD
secured notes tranche 2, the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes as being issued by the LuxCo co-issuer
and interest on such notes as foreign source. The following discussion assumes that such treatment would be
respected.

**Additional Payments**

In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of (or at differed times than scheduled
payments of) stated interest or principal on the notes (e.g., upon a change of control as described in “Description of
Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Change of Control”, or in respect of
withholding taxes as described in “Description of Secured Notes—Additional Amounts”). The requirement to make
any such payments may implicate the provisions of the Treasury Regulations governing contingent payment debt
instruments (“CPDIs”). According to the applicable Treasury Regulations, certain contingencies will not cause a debt
instrument to be treated as a CPDI if such contingencies, as of the date of issuance, are “remote or incidental.”
Although the matter is not free from doubt, we believe, and intend to take the position, that no such additional amounts
are treated as paid and the notes are not CPDIs. Our determination is binding on a holder unless such holder timely
disclose its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. Our determination is not,
however, binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to challenge this determination, a holder subject to U.S. federal
income taxation might be required to accrue income on the notes based upon a “comparable yield” (as defined in the
Treasury Regulations) in excess of stated interest and to treat as ordinary income rather than as capital gain some or
all of any gain realized on the taxable disposition of a note. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding
the tax consequences if the notes were treated as CPDIs. The remainder of this summary assumes that no such
additional amounts are treated as paid and the notes will not be treated as CPDIs.

**Consequences to U.S. Holders**

A “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is or is treated as, for United States federal income
tax purposes, any of the following:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District
of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

    - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a
valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United
States person.

**Interest**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a note generally will be taxable to U.S.
holders as ordinary income at the time that such interest is received or accrued, in accordance with their regular method
of tax accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is assumed that none of the notes will be issued with an
original issue discount equal to or exceeding a de minimis amount.


-----

If a U.S. holder receives a payment of interest on a note denominated in euro or sterling and such U.S. Holder
uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. holder will be required to include
in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the interest (including additional amounts) received on the
notes, determined by translating the euro or sterling received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A U.S. holder will not recognize exchange
gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the
actual disposition of the euros or sterling so received.

If a U.S. Holder receives a payment of interest on a note denominated in euro or sterling and such U.S. Holder
uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or such U.S. holder is otherwise required
to accrue interest prior to receipt), the U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to
interest (including additional amounts) received on the notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first
method, a U.S. holder will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest
that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period
or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a
U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, a U.S. holder may elect to
translate interest income at the spot rate on (i) the last day of the accrual period, (ii) the last day of the portion of the
accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period straddles such U.S. holder’s taxable year, or (iii)
the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period.
This election will apply to all debt obligations that a U.S. holder holds from year to year and cannot be changed
without the consent of the IRS. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the advisability of making the
above election.

In addition, upon receipt by such a U.S. Holder of an interest payment on a note denominated in euro or
sterling (including, upon the sale of a note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but
unpaid interest previously included in income), such U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency gain or loss (treated
as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of
such payment (determined by translating the euros or sterling received at the spot rate on the date such payment is
received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income such U.S. Holder previously included in income with respect
to such payment. This exchange gain or loss will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**Foreign Tax Credit**

As discussed above, we intend to take the position that solely with respect to the USD secured notes tranche
2, the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes, interest income earned by a U.S. holder will constitute foreign
source income and be considered “passive category income” or, in the case of certain U.S. holders, “general category
income” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which may be relevant to a U.S. holder in calculating the holder’s
foreign tax credit limitation. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by the U.S. holder with respect to those notes at a
rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or, at such holder’s election, a deduction in lieu
of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The limitation on foreign taxes
eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. The rules governing foreign tax
credits are complex and, therefore, U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of
foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances. If any foreign withholding tax is imposed on the USD secured
notes tranche 1 or the unsecured notes, a U.S. holder may not be able to utilize any foreign tax credits associated
therewith unless such holder has foreign source income in the same category from other investments.

**Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes**

U.S. holders generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a note equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon the disposition (less
any portion allocable to any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent not
previously included in income) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note at the time of disposition. A U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note will generally be the price paid therefor.

Solely with respect to the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes, a U.S. holder’s price paid
generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros or sterling paid for such note determined at the spot rate on the date


-----

of such purchase. If a U.S. holder’s note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable
transaction for euros or sterling, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros or sterling
received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition. However, if a U.S. holder is a cash method taxpayer and the notes are traded on an established securities
market, euros or sterling paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date
(rather than the trade date) of the purchase or sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with
respect to the purchase and sale of notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied
consistently to all debt instruments from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note generally will be capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if such U.S. holder has held the note for more than one year. Otherwise, such gain or loss will
generally be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including
individuals, may be taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses
is subject to limitations under the Code.

Solely with respect to the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes, a portion of a U.S. holder’s gain
or loss may be treated as foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of such note. Such foreign
currency gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss. For
these purposes, the principal amount of the note is the purchase price for the note calculated in euros or sterling on the
date of purchase, and the amount of foreign currency gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the
U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of the note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date the U.S.
holder purchased the note. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain
or loss realized on the disposition of the note.

Each U.S. holder are urged to consult its tax advisor as to the deductibility of capital losses in its particular
circumstances.

**Disposition of Foreign Currency**

Euros or sterling received as interest on a note or on the sale or other disposition of a note generally will have
a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time the euros or sterling are received. Any gain or loss recognized by
a U.S. holder on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the euros or sterling will be
ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss. A U.S. holder that purchases a note
with previously owned euros or sterling will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if
any, between such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such euros or sterling and the U.S. dollar fair market value of
such note on the date of purchase.

**Reportable Transactions and Foreign Financial Asset Reporting**

U.S. Treasury Regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could be
interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions.
Under the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including,
in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note (such as
a euro secured note or sterling secured note), or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note, to the
extent that such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold
amount. Holders considering the purchase of euro secured notes or sterling secured notes are urged to consult with
their tax advisor to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the euro secured notes
and/or sterling secured notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure
Statement).

Individuals and certain entities who or that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value
exceeding certain threshold amounts generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets
with their tax returns. The USD secured notes tranche 2, the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes generally


-----

will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless such notes are held in
a financial account at certain financial institutions. Failure to report such information, if required, may result in
substantial penalties. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding such requirement.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Information reporting requirements will generally apply to certain payments to a U.S. holder of interest on
the notes and the proceeds of disposition (including a retirement or redemption of a note), unless the U.S. holder is an
exempt recipient (such as a corporation). Additionally, backup withholding would generally apply to any such
payments to a U.S. holder that is not an exempt recipient if such U.S. holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer
identification number (“TIN”) on an IRS Form W-9 or other applicable form and certify that it is a United States
person (as defined under the Code) and has not previously been notified by the IRS that it has failed to report all
interest and dividends required to be shown on its United States federal income tax returns.

U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup
withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax and taxpayers may use amounts withheld as a credit against their United States federal income tax
liability or may claim a refund as long as they timely provide certain information to the IRS.

**Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

A “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a USD secured note tranche 1 or an unsecured note that is,
for United States federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is not a U.S. holder.

As discussed above, the issuers intend to treat interest paid on the USD secured notes tranche 2, the euro
notes and the sterling notes as foreign source. If such treatment is respected, no U.S. withholding should apply on
interest paid on such notes. However, there is no assurance that the IRS would not challenge such treatment. If the
IRS were to successfully challenge such treatment, interest on the USD secured notes tranche 2, the euro secured notes
and the sterling secured notes may be treated as U.S. source, and any non-U.S. investor holding such notes may be
subject to withholding at 30%.

**Payments of Interest**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, interest paid on a note to non-U.S.
holders generally will be exempt from United States federal income and withholding tax under the “portfolio interest
exemption,” provided that:

    - such non-U.S. holder does not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of our capital or profits
interest;

    - such non-U.S. holder is not a controlled foreign corporation actually or constructively related to us
through equity ownership;

    - such non-U.S. holder is not a bank that acquired the notes on an extension of credit made pursuant to a
loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business;

    - such interest is not effectively connected with such non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in
the United States; and

    - either (1) such non-U.S. holder provides its name, address and TIN, if any, on an applicable IRS Form
W-8, and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a United States person as defined under the
Code or (2) such non-U.S. holder holds its notes through certain foreign intermediaries or certain
foreign partnerships and it and such intermediary or partnership satisfies the certification requirements
of applicable Treasury Regulations. Special certification rules apply to non-U.S. holders that are passthrough entities.


-----

If a non-U.S. holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to such nonU.S. holder generally will be subject to a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless such non-U.S. holder
provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed:

    - IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or other applicable form), claiming an
exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or

    - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) stating that interest paid on the notes is not subject to
withholding tax because it is effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United
States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a
permanent establishment in the United States to which such interest is attributable).

In the case of a non-U.S. holder that is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the
notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, then, although such non-U.S. holder will be
exempt from the 30% withholding tax (provided the certification requirements discussed above are satisfied), unless
an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, such non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on that interest on a net basis in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. In addition,
in the case of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation, such non-U.S. holder may be subject to a branch profits tax equal
to 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject
to certain adjustments.

The certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment
of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. Holders that do not timely provide the applicable withholding
agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty, may
obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. NonU.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income
tax treaty.

**Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, a non-U.S. holder generally will not
be subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to gain recognized on the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a note (other than any amount representing accrued but unpaid interest on
the note, which is subject to the rules discussed above under “—Payments of Interest”) unless:

    - such gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the
United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a
permanent establishment in the United States to which such gain is attributable); or

    - such non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during
the taxable year in which gain is realized and certain other conditions are met.

If the first exception applies, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, such non-U.S. holder
generally will be subject to United States federal income tax on the net gain derived from the disposition in generally
the same manner as if it were a U.S. holder and, if such non-U.S. holder is a corporation, may be subject to a 30%
U.S. branch profits tax (or lower applicable treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable
year, subject to certain adjustments. If the second exception applies, such non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to
United States federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate) on any gain recognized on the
disposition, which gain may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely
filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Generally, the amount of interest paid to non-U.S. holders on the notes and the amount of tax, if any, withheld
with respect to those payments will be reported annually to the IRS and to non-U.S. holders. Copies of the information


-----

returns reporting such interest payments and withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the
country in which a non-U.S. holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.

In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest
on the notes, provided the certification described above in the last bullet of the first paragraph under “—Payments of
Interest” has been received and provided the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason
to know the holder is a United States person. However, a non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and,
depending on the circumstances, backup withholding at the applicable rate, with respect to payments of the proceeds
of the sale of a note within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless
the certification described above has been received or the non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an exemption.

Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from
backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against
a non-U.S. holder’s United States federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is correctly
and timely provided to the IRS.

**FATCA**

Under sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act (“FATCA”), withholding at a rate of 30% will generally be required on payments of interest in respect
of the USD secured notes tranche 1 and the unsecured notes if paid to a foreign entity (including an investment fund
and a foreign entity acting as an intermediary) unless (i) if the foreign entity is a “foreign financial institution,” the
foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the foreign
entity is a “non-financial foreign entity,” the foreign entity identifies certain of its U.S. investors or provides
certification that it does not have any such investors, or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise exempt from FATCA.
Accordingly, the entity through which notes are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is
required. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country, or future
Treasury Regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements. Under proposed Treasury regulations that
may be relied upon pending finalization, these withholding requirements would generally not apply to gross proceeds
from asset dispositions. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA
on their investment in the notes.

Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding
under FATCA to their investment in the notes.

**CERTAIN UNITED KINGDOM TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The comments below are of a general nature and are not intended to be an exhaustive description of all United
Kingdom tax considerations relating to the notes. They are based on current United Kingdom tax law as applied in
England and Wales and HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) practice (which may not be binding on HMRC), both
of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. The following is a general summary only of the
United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments under the guarantees of the notes. The comments are not
exhaustive, and do not deal with United Kingdom tax aspects of acquiring, holding, disposing of or dealing in the
notes. The comments below only apply to persons who are beneficial owners of the notes and do not necessarily apply
where any payment on the notes is deemed for tax purposes to be the income of any other person. The comments
below do not purport to constitute legal or tax advice. Any prospective purchasers of any notes who are in doubt as to
their own tax position, or who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom., are urged to
consult their own professional advisor.

**Payments under the Guarantees**

If payments by a guarantor under the guarantees are not treated as having a United Kingdom source they
should not be payable under deduction of United Kingdom income tax. If this is not the case then, depending on the
correct legal analysis of the payments as a matter of United Kingdom tax law (which is uncertain), it is possible that
such payments by a guarantor (other than payments in respect of principal) would be payable under deduction of
United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to any claim which could be made under
applicable double tax treaties or any other available exceptions and reliefs, including an exception for certain payments
to a company within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax, an entity falling within various categories enjoying
a special tax status (including charities and pension funds), or where a partnership consisting of such persons is
beneficially entitled (unless HMRC directs otherwise).

**LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES**

**AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary description of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the notes_
_offered hereby and the related guarantees and security interests, and a summary of certain insolvency law_
_considerations in the jurisdiction in which certain guarantors are incorporated. The description is only a summary_
_and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity_
_and enforceability of the guarantees and security interests. As such, prospective investors in the notes should consult_
_their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**England and Wales**

Certain guarantors and providers of collateral are companies incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales (the “English Obligors”).

**_Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English Courts_**

While the United Kingdom was a member state of the European Union, insolvency processes opened in the
United Kingdom were subject to both EU and applicable UK domestic legislation. Following the United Kingdom’s
departure from the European Union on January 31, 2020 and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the
“Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as
amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the United
Kingdom at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law
subject to significant amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as
amended) effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the UK, including
the Insolvency Regulation 2000 and the EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Recast
Insolvency Regulation”), and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”),
the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2006 (SI 2016/1024) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border
Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”).

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the
Transition Period, in which case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation
govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligors would likely proceed under, and
be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However,
to the extent that an English Obligor has its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in a member state of the European
Union, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions,
be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, pursuant
to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency
proceedings of any English Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it
carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction.

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings
available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect
of any company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other
than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of
operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open
main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. While this allows
English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the
efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such
proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border Recognition of English Insolvency and Restructuring
Proceedings'”, below).

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the notes are guaranteed
by the guarantees and secured by security interests over the collateral (for the secured notes only). English insolvency


-----

laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee against an English Obligor and of the security
interests over the collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such limitations.
The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the guarantees
and/or under the collateral securing the secured notes and the related guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts
that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Obligor.

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

Certain guarantees related to the secured notes benefit from fixed and floating charge security over certain
collateral owned by the English Obligors.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security.

Until floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating
charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the
charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge.

On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge,
may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not
crystallised at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security
which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency
officeholders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration)
properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including
the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a
charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses
in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured
assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action
relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the
floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the
floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral
arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market
debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as
amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”), assets subject to floating charge security are subject to the claims
of certain preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors (see “—Priority on
Insolvency” below); and (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security.

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that fixed security interests expressed to be
created by a security document governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description
given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as
fixed security interests rather than recharacterised as floating security interests will depend, among other things, on
whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the
relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice.
Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its
discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question
constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration_**

English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of any
company within their general jurisdiction (see “—Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English
Courts” above), any company incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or a member state of the EEA, any company
(irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its COMI in the United Kingdom or an EU member state (other than
Denmark) and upon request from courts in other parts of the United Kingdom or certain other countries and territories.
In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the


-----

relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably
likely to achieve the purpose of administration.

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they
fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of
its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act.
Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand
for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court
order).

The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing
the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s
creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) or, if
neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily
harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to one or more seemed or preferential creditors. The order
of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on Insolvency” below).

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, the debtor company, the directors of such company or
the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as described in “—Qualifying Floating Charge” below) where the floating
charge has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court. Different appointment procedures
apply according to the identity of the appointor.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business as an agent of the company to which they are
appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in
administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realisation of
any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors
and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “—Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior
approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to
promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards
discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder.

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon
the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that no step may be taken to enforce
security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court.
The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including
legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case,
a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory
objectives of administration described above.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to
realise their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by
virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a
“financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or
tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter into administration, the guarantees granted by such
English Obligors and the related collateral may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of
the administrator while the relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that the security agent
would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

**_Qualifying Floating Charge_**

If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English
insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator using the out of court process (see “—
Administration” above) or (in limited circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “—Administrative Receivership”
below). The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or


-----

its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where
applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed
appointors over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the
company going into administration.

A floating charge constitutes a qualifying floating charge if it is created by an instrument which (a) states
that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (being paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the the Insolvency Act), (b)
purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company, or (c) purports to empower the holder to
appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be
the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of
security granted to that party, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company,
and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge.

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy is only available in very limited circumstances. The ability
to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of a qualifying floating charge where either the security
document granting such charge pre-dates 15 September 2003 or where it falls within one of the exceptions under the
Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002). The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the
appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the
Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant
English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market
investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments and debt
instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and
not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and
then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security
pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue,
a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “—Transactions at an Undervalue”, “—Preference” and “—Voidable
Floating Charge” below, respectively). If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office.

**_Fixed Charge Receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating
charges; see “—Administrative Receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a
fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances)
pursuant to statute.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge
(such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an
appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may
require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created
or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral
Regulations (see “—Administration” above).

The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning
(s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor (although the receiver owes the charger a duty to act in good
faith during the course of his or her appointment). This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs
his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy
whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realising the charged assets, the receiver will need to take
reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be
entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realisations made of the assets of the company
(and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).


-----

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be deducted
from the proceeds of the realisation of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see
“—Prescribed Part” below).

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as
applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails
a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of
the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision
procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary
arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75%
(by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of
unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement, except
to the extent that it is under-secured.

Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not trigger a moratorium of
claims or proceedings (though see “—Moratoriums” below).

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts
have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a
company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors) provided that such company is liable to be wound up under
the Insolvency Act. This requires a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales (among other matters). An English
Obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities.

In practice, the requisite “sufficient connection” has been found to be satisfied where, among other things,
the company’s COMI is in England and Wales, the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the
company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law.
Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily
determine whether or not specific circumstances satisfy the requirement for sufficient connection in any given
case.Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the
rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given
under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number
representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors
vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance
documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including
those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then
needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and
consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an
order conditional upon modifications being made or decline to sanction the scheme.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically
trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings (although see “—Moratoriums” below).

**_Restructuring Plan_**

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance At 2020 (“CIGA”) was enacted on June 25, 2020, and the
majority of its provisions took effect on June 26, 2020. The CIGA is intended to improve the ability of companies to
be efficiently restructured.


-----

The CIGA inserts a new restructuring plan procedure into the Companies Act 2006, under Part 26A. The new
procedure is similar to a scheme of arrangement in that it allows the English courts to effect a compromise of a
company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors), but with the added possibility
of “cross-class cram-down”. While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of
arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is
likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a
going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or
any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial
difficulties.

A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator
or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending
on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such
creditors are given under the restructuring plan.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and voting
at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed compromise, there is no requirement for
the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting, and there is crucially
no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided that the court is satisfied that (a) none
of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they
would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’;(b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of
creditors who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the
‘relevant alternative’; and (iii) the court considers the plan is just and equitable. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the
purposes of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company
if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for
the possibility of a ”cross-class cram-down”, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more
classes of affected creditors do not vote in favour of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class
of stakeholders to bind other classes.

Following approval of the restructuring plan at the meetings of creditors, the restructuring plan needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether each applicable statutory condition
has been satisfied and consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to
whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or
decline to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose
rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan
to the Registrar of Companies.

As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically
trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings (although see “—Moratoriums” below).

**_Liquidation/Winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realised and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—
Priority on Insolvency” below). There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court;
and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s
members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a
members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s
solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent
company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act; see “—Administration”
above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a
resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the
creditors.


-----

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding- up.
In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s
property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will
not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial
collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision
taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of
a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition.
Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No
action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject
to such terms as the court may impose.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the members’ resolution to wind up. As a result, there
is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary
winding- up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the
continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security.

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the
business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and
execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “—Avoidance of
Transactions” below).

In light of the coronavirus pandemic, legislation has been introduced which temporarily restricts the ability
of creditors to present winding-up petitions and of courts to grant winding-up orders. While these measures remain in
place, (a) winding-up petitions on the basis of a company’s inability to satisfy a statutory demands alone are void if
the relevant statutory demands were served between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, and (b) where winding-up
petitions are presented between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021 based on other grounds, the petitioning creditor
must show that it had reasonable grounds to believe that coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company or
that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the
company. Between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, a court may similarly only grant a winding-up order in
circumstances where a company is deemed unable to pay its debts and it appears to the court that coronavirus has had
a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition if the court is satisfied that the company’s
insolvency would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the company.

**_Priority on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern,
one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realise the assets of the company in question
and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes,
with the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as
set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to
a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors
have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed
in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are
only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency
set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their
mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation
of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if
amounts remain due to the company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):


-----

- _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in_
the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent the realizations
from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest account for
the relevant indebtedness;

- _Second ranking: prescribed fees and expenses of the official receiver;_

- Third ranking: where winding-up procedures are begun within 12 weeks following the end of any (new,
stand-alone) moratorium (see further below), unpaid moratorium debts and unpaid priority pre-moratorium
debts;

- _Fourth ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there_
are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are-paid);

- _Fifth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation
to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work
done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday
pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or
after the date of insolvency. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts are limited to (a) certain categories of bank account deposits, and (b) claims by
HMRC in respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee
NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer
NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one
another, secondary preferential debts rank equally after the ordinary preferential debts and, as between one
another, the categories of bank account deposits rank before the HMRC claims;

- _Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets,_
according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed
charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge.
However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as
defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

- _Seventh ranking:_

firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured
shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured
shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured
creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is
sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official
rate in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after
the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been
converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due
under the notes offered hereby or related guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the notes may,
if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries;
and

thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and
therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This however


-----

does not include “currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme Court Lehman Brothers
ruling dated May 17, 2017; and

  - _Eighth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds_
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of
priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the
relevant documentation.

**_Prescribed Part_**

An insolvency practitioner of a company (e.g. an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will
generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for
the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating
charge realisations) (the “—Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s
net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company's net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate
cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking
floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed
Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the
resulting benefit to creditors.

**_Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and/or guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into
administration or liquidation within a specified period after the granting of the security and/or guarantee. Therefore,
if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or
liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company.

The issuers cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as
described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect
of the notes and secured notes offered hereby, as applicable, would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the
transaction as valid.

_Onset of Insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid
floating charges (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise,
the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency
is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company
passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be
the same as for the initial administration.

_Connected Persons_

If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions
at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow
director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company.


-----

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or
civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A company
is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one
and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group
of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be
regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by
a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company
which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he
is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the
company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these
conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest or
guarantee granted by the English Obligors include, without limitation, the following described below:

_Transactions at an Undervalue_

Under Section 238 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order
to set aside a transaction, for example, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief as the
court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) where the creation of such security
interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue.

A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence
of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section
123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the company enters liquidation or
administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date of the relevant transaction. In any proceedings,
it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of
the transaction was a connected person (see “—Connected Persons” above), in which case there is a presumption of
insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time
of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction.

A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the
company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or
money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court shall not make an order if it is
satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and
that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order
as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which
may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for
a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they
are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest
in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any
interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in
good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was
a party to the transaction.

_Preferences_

Under Section 239 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order
to set aside a transaction, for example, payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief


-----

as the court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) where such transaction
constituted a preference.

A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction,
the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency
Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a
period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the
beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the
company’s employee) from the date of the relevant transaction. A transaction may constitute a preference if a
transaction has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company ’ s
debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor,
guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, for the court
to determine a transaction was a preference, it must be shown that the company was influenced by a desire to produce
the preferential effect.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its
debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of
the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being
the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the
connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to
restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include
reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a preference
may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the
preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person
other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will
not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the
liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that
person at a time when they were a creditor of the company.

_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_

Under Section 423 of the Insolvency Act, where a transaction was at an undervalue and the court is satisfied
that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may
make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the
claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction
defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction
including the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the
company is in liquidation or administration) and use of the provision is therefore not limited to liquidators or
administrators. There is no statutory time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal
statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of,
the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such
order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to
protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside
security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any
person whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will
not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith,
for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from
such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the
liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Voidable Floating Charges_


-----

Under Section 245 of the Insolvency Act, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year
prior to the onset of the company’s insolvency (or two years in the case of a floating charge in favour of a connected
person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a consequence of the
transaction will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the goods or services supplied
to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of
the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “—Consideration”). The requirement for a company to be unable to pay
its debts at the time of granting the floating charge or to become insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply
where the floating charge is granted to a connected person.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a
floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is
automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration, irrespective of whether the relevant
company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

However, if the floating charge is created or otherwise arises under a “security financial collateral
arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as
described in “—Administration” above.

_Recharacterisation of Fixed Charges_

As referred to above (see “—Fixed Versus Floating Charges” above), note the risk of a fixed charge being
recharacterised as a floating charge. If such recharacterisation falls within the suspect period referred to above (see
“—Voidable Floating Charges” above), this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the Consideration.

_Disclaimer_

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other
property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any
other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise
to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be detrimental to
creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company
could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous property does not apply
to an executed contract nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any
liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

**_Security over Shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English Obligor are, under English
law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charging company creates an
encumbrance over the property in favour of the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the shares.
Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the
discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may
additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured
parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English
company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.

**_Security over Bank Accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “—Account Charge”) granted by an English
Obligor, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “—Account Bank”) may have reserved their
right at any time to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other
arrangements with that English Obligor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating
(rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account
Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account


-----

Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the
occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been
formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and setoff rights unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

_Constitutional Documents, Corporate Benefit and Financial Assistance_

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of another
group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed
by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow
such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and
the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with
an English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation.

Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry
into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that
he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members
as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be
found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.
Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to
consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when
directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or
should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning
“probable.”

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the
extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

_Security Registration_

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document
pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security governed
by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the
Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest (the
“—Registration Period”). In light of the coronavirus pandemic, the Registration Period has temporarily been extended
to 31 days for security interests granted between June 6, 2020 and April 5, 2021 (unless extended further). While the
Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security, security will
be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not
registered within the Registration Period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured
by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to
the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the
Registration Period has expired.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with
the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does
not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may
still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

_Moratoriums_

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the
automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable
to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees.


-----

Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “—Administration” above),
moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “—Liquidation/Winding-up” above).

The CIGA inserts a new stand-alone moratorium into the Insolvency Act to facilitate company restructurings.

Entry into a moratorium is similar to the current out-of-court administrator appointment procedure, i.e., filing
relevant papers at court (except where the company is subject to an outstanding winding-up petition or is an overseas
company, in which case the company must apply to court for the moratorium).

The moratorium is subject to the supervision of a licensed insolvency practitioner (the “Monitor”). As a
condition to commencement of the moratorium, the company requires confirmation from the Monitor that the
company is eligible for the moratorium and that, in the Monitor’s view, it is likely that a moratorium for the company
would result in the rescue of the company as a going concern.

The moratorium is available to companies that are, or are likely to become, unable to pay their debts. A
company is excluded from being eligible for the moratorium if (among other matters):

  - at any time in the previous 12 months, the company has been subject to a formal insolvency proceeding; or

  - the company is party to a “capital market arrangement” (including the grant of security or a guarantee) under
which a party has incurred a debt of at least £10 million, where the arrangement involves the issue of a capital
market investment.

The moratorium lasts for an initial period of 20 business days, subject to possible extension.

A company subject to a moratorium effectively receives a payment holiday in respect of its pre-moratorium
debts, subject to broad exceptions (including debts or liabilities arising under a contract involving financial services).

The Monitor must terminate the moratorium if certain circumstances arise, including if the Monitor thinks
that the moratorium is no longer likely to result in the rescue of a company as a going concern.

If a company enters liquidation within 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium, any unpaid moratorium
debts, and certain pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday during the moratorium,
will have priority over other claims in the liquidation. Pre-existing financial debts accelerated during the moratorium
will not receive such priority, other than in respect of amounts which already fell due during the moratorium. If a
company enters administration within 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium, the administrator must make a
distribution in respect of any unpaid moratorium debts, and those pre moratorium debts for which the company did
not have a payment holiday during the moratorium and which are payable in priority over other claims in
administration.

Any person affected by the moratorium may challenge it on certain grounds, including that of unfair harm,
at any time during the moratorium.

_Restriction on the Operation and Exercise of Ipso Facto Provisions_

Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto
clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency
procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow
suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the
contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under
the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’
(i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring
plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the
company or the relevant officeholder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is
satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship.


-----

The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the
provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees,
contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of,
arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act). In light of the
coronavirus pandemic, certain small suppliers are also temporarily excluded from the restrictions where the
counterparty enters into relevant insolvency procedures prior to 30 June 2021 (unless extended further).

**_Cross-border Recognition of English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings_**

_General Position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by
applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and
judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in
the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the
“Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and the United
Kingdom, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for
recognition of certain UK insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if
COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the United Kingdom) or foreign non-main proceedings (if COMI
is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the United Kingdom).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and
restructuring plan processes, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties
regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments
such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 and the Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the
United Kingdom’s pending accession to the latter) where these apply.

_Recognition in the European Union_

Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union and the expiry of the Transition Period,
UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and
cooperation terms agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom do not include a replacement regime
for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the European Union (and vice versa) or
otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the United Kingdom and one or more EU
member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic
for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and for UK office holders to
effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and
recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need
may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where
the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is
much less certain that such appointment will be recognised in other EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the United Kingdom was
a member state of the European Union. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings
will be recognised and whether investors may adversely affected as a result.

**Luxembourg**

The LuxCo co-issuer, certain guarantors and certain providers of collateral are companies incorporated under
the laws of Luxembourg (the “Luxembourg Obligors”).


-----

**_The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may limit your ability to effectively enforce your rights under the notes offered_**
**_hereby_**

The rights of holders under the notes offered hereby and the collateral may be subject to the insolvency and
administrative laws of Luxembourg, and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex,
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The secured notes will be co-issued by the LuxCo co-issuer, which is
incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. The Luxembourg Companies Law differs in material aspects from the
laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and security holders, including the provisions relating to interested
directors, managers, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, security holder lawsuits and indemnification
of directors or managers. Under Luxembourg law, the duties of directors or managers of a company are generally
owed to the company only; creditors of Luxembourg companies generally do not have rights to take action against
directors of the company, except in limited circumstances. Managers of a Luxembourg company must, in exercising
their powers and performing their duties, act in good faith and in the interests of the company as a whole and must
exercise due care, skill and diligence in the performance of their duties. Directors or managers have a duty not to put
themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are
under a duty to disclose any direct or indirect, personal financial interest in any contract or arrangement with the
company or any of its subsidiaries. If a manager of a Luxembourg company is found to have breached his or her duties
to such company, he or she may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty. A manager
may be jointly and severally liable with other managers implicated in the same breach of duty.

Insolvency proceedings with respect to companies incorporated in Luxembourg would likely be governed by
the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization. In addition, the Luxembourg Obligors could be required to proceed
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the company has its “centre of main interests,” as defined in Regulation
(EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU
Insolvency Regulation”), at the time insolvency proceedings are commenced. Although there is a rebuttable
presumption that the “centre of main interests” will be in the jurisdiction where its registered office is situated, this
presumption is not conclusive. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to these companies may proceed
under, and be governed by, the insolvency laws of another jurisdiction if the “centre of main interests” of these
companies is determined to be in such other jurisdiction at the relevant time.

The insolvency laws of such jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as those of the United
States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar. If the Luxembourg Obligors or any of their subsidiaries
experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

The liabilities of the LuxCo co-issuer in respect of the notes will, in the event of its liquidation following
bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the
purpose of such liquidation) and those of the concerned company’s debts that are entitled to priority under
Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others, certain amounts owed to the
Luxembourg Revenue, value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise,
social security contributions, and remuneration owed to employees.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

During insolvency proceedings, unsecured creditors may not bring enforcement measures against the
Luxembourg company. The ability of secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited in the
event of controlled management proceedings automatically causing the rights of secured creditors to be frozen until a
final decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter
by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of
the creditors representing more than 50% of the Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect.

Generally, Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by a
Luxembourg company during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period, which is a maximum of six months and ten days
preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of
the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular:


-----

  - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some specific transactions (in particular, the
granting of a security interest for antecedent debts, the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether
payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts
which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; and the sale of assets without
consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the
ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver;

  - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as
other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the
court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of
the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; and

  - article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the civil code gives the insolvency
receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions,
including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time
limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of
contracts. The contracts, therefore, survive after the bankruptcy order, but the insolvency receiver may choose to
terminate certain contracts. However, as of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim
will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy order provides for a period of time during which creditors
must file their claims with the clerk’s office of the Luxembourg district court sitting in commercial matters. After
having converted all available assets of the company into cash and after having determined all the company’s
liabilities, the insolvency receiver will distribute the proceeds of the sale, on a pro rata basis, to the creditors after
deduction of the receiver fees and the bankruptcy administration costs.

Insolvency proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the relevant Luxembourg company’s business
and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations with respect to the Notes.

**_Security interests considerations_**

The secured notes are secured by several security interests governed by Luxembourg law. According to
Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex situs (the law
of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation to the creation,
perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in
relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located
in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank,
receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located
in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically
located in Luxembourg, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will
be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law.
The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares,
bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. A judgment of the European Court of
Justice dated 10 November 2016 in Case C 156/15 relating to a pledge over monies deposited to a current account,
has held that Directive 2002/47/EC of 6 June 2002 on financial collateral arrangements, confers to the pledgee the
right to enforce the collateral, notwithstanding the commencement of insolvency proceedings in respect of the pledgor,
only if, (i) the monies covered by the collateral were deposited in the account in question before the commencement
of those proceedings or those monies were deposited in the account in question on the day of commencement, the
pledgor having proved that it was not aware, nor should have been aware, that those proceedings had commended and
(ii) the account holder was prevented from disposing of those monies after they had been deposited in that account.

Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration,
notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge over registered shares in a Luxembourg company must be


-----

(i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the pledge) and (ii) registered
in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require
additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge under a receivables pledge agreement
will be validly created and perfected provided that the pledge under such receivables pledge agreement is executed by
the parties thereto. However, if the debtor has not been notified of such receivables pledge or if it did not otherwise
acquire knowledge of the pledge, it will be validly discharged of its obligations if it pays the pledgor. A bank account
pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has
waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts
are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required.

Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence
of an enforcement event, including, without limitation:

  - the direct appropriation, or appropriation by third parties, of the pledged assets at a value determined in
accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties;

  - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms (conditions
_commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by way of a public auction;_

  - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a
valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

  - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the
method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv) the possible need to involve
third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be
substantially delayed.

According to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, with the exception of the provisions of the law of January 8,
2013 on the over-extension of debt, the provisions of Book III, Title XVII of the Luxembourg Civil Code, of Book I,
Title VIII and of Book III of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and national or foreign provisions governing
reorganisation measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings and attachments are not applicable to
financial collateral arrangements and netting agreements and shall not constitute an obstacle to the enforcement and
to the performance by the parties of their obligations. Pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, a
financial collateral arrangement entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of
reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid and binding against third parties,
administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators notwithstanding the suspect period referred to in Articles 445 and
446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the secured party proves that it was unaware of the fact that such
proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it.

According to article 24 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the above protection applies not only to
Luxembourg security interests governed by the Luxembourg Collateral Law (such as Luxembourg pledges over or
collateral assignments of claims and financial instruments), but extends to foreign law financial collateral
arrangements, which are similar to the financial collateral arrangements subject to the Luxembourg Collateral Law,
where the collateral giver is located in Luxembourg.

Foreign law-governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be
enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or
arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers or
administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg
security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise
have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency
proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security


-----

interests or arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU
Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any thirdparty creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests
created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the
forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in
principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law).

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by
operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or
unsecured creditors. This includes, in particular, the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well
as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the tax authorities and certain
assimilated parties (such as social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the
insolvent party. This general privilege may take precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.

**_Financial assistance_**

Any security interests granted by Luxembourg entities, which constitute breach of the provisions on financial
assistance as defined by article 430-19 of the Luxembourg Companies Law or any other similar provisions might not
be enforceable.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the notes, the security interests agreements, the indenture and the transactions documents
(and any document in connection therewith) with the Administration de l’Enregistrement, des Domaines et de la TVA
in Luxembourg may be required in the case that the notes, the security interest agreements, the indenture, and the
Transactions documents (and any document in connection therewith) are either (i) attached as an annex to an act
(annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (deposes
au rang des minutes d’un notaire) or (iii) registered on a voluntary basis. In such case, either a nominal registration
duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document
so registered) will be payable depending on the nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable
in respect of security interest agreements, which are subject to the Luxembourg Collateral Law.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require (when these are presented before
them) that the notes, the security interests agreements, the indenture and the transactions documents (and any
document in connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French, German
or Luxembourgish.

**_Luxembourg guarantee limitation_**

The granting of cross or upstream guarantees by a Luxembourg company in order to secure the obligations
of other entities may raise some corporate benefit issues, in particular in relation to the corporate interest of the
Luxembourg company having to provide such guarantees.

When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees, applicable corporate procedures normally entail that the
decision be approved by a board resolution or by the decision of delegates that have been appointed by the board of
managers or directors of the Luxembourg company for such purpose. In addition, the granting of the envisaged
guarantees must comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object.

The proposed action by the company must be “in the corporate interest of the company,” which is a translation
of the French “intérêt social,” an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of
“corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and interpreted by court precedents and
may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior.” Whereas the discussions regarding the limits
of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of


-----

corporate benefit requires a subjective judgment. In a group context, the interest of the companies of the group taken
individually is not entirely eliminated.

With respect to Guarantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the Luxembourg Companies Law does not
provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of
the same group, it is generally held that within a group of companies, in the context of a group of related companies,
the existence of a group interest in granting upstream or cross stream assistance under any form (including under the
form of guarantee or security) to other group companies could constitute sufficient corporate benefit to enable a
Luxembourg company to grant such guarantee, provided that the following conditions are met (and subject in any
event to all the factual circumstances of the matter): (i) such guarantee must be given for the purpose of promoting a
common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group,
(ii) the commitment to grant such guarantee must not be without consideration and such commitment must not be
manifestly disproportionate in view of the obligations entered into by other group companies, and (iii) such guarantee
granted or any other financial commitments must not exceed the financial capabilities of the committing company.

Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee on a group level is certainly
important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate for a lack of corporate interest for one or
more of the companies of the group taken individually. The concept of corporate interest is of particular importance
in the context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Companies Law.

The failure to comply with the corporate interest requirement will typically result in personal liability (civil
and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the Guarantor concerned. The guarantees granted by a Luxembourg
company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy
(ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses addressed by the Luxembourg
Companies Law, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted for misuse of corporate assets
only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person may be an interested third party, e.g.,
a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In addition, it cannot be excluded that the
public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse of corporate assets became known
to him. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by court, then this could, under general principles
of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Companies Law will
be held null and void. The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case by case basis, and a subjective, fact
based judgment is required to be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company.

As a result of the above developments, the guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company (in the context of
upstream and/or cross stream guarantee(s)) will be subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of general
limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, inter
alia, its net assets (capitaux propres)) increased by its subordinated debts (dettes subordonnées), which is inserted in
the relevant finance document(s), indentures or guarantee agreements and which covers the aggregate obligations and
exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under the guarantee.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of_
_the notes offered hereby._

The notes and the guarantees (together, the “Securities”) have not been, and will not be, registered under the
Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Securities offered hereby are being
offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in reliance
on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons outside of the United States
(in each case, as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and the “United States” with the meanings given to
them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Securities (other than the initial purchasers), by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed
to have acknowledged, represented to, warranted to and agreed with the issuers, each guarantor and the initial
purchasers as follows:

(1) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Securities have not been registered under the Securities
Act or the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and that the Securities are being offered for
resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including
sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or
otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto
and, in each case, in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below;

(2) The purchaser is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the issuers or any
guarantor, is not acting on behalf of the issuers or any guarantor and is either:

(a) a qualified institutional buyer, within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and is aware
that any sale of these Securities to them will be made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities
Act, and such acquisition will be for their own account or for the account of another qualified
institutional buyer; or

(b) a U.S. person (and is not purchasing the Securities for the account or benefit of a U.S. person) and is
purchasing the Securities outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act;

(3) The purchaser acknowledges that none of the issuers, the guarantors, or the initial purchasers, nor any person
representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or sale of any of the
Securities, other than the information contained in this offering circular, which offering circular has been
delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Securities. It
acknowledges that neither the initial purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this offering circular. It has had access to
such financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as it has deemed necessary in
connection with its decision to purchase any of the Securities, including an opportunity to ask questions of,
and request information from, the issuers and the initial purchasers;

(4) The purchaser is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which
it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case, for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such
investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell
such Securities to a qualified institutional buyer pursuant to Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions pursuant to Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the Securities
Act, or in any transaction not subject to the Securities Act;


-----

(5) The purchaser understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is
purchasing the Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities by its acceptance thereof will be
deemed to agree, that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any Securities or any
beneficial interests in any Securities, it will do so prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”)
which is, in the case of Securities offered to qualified institutional buyers, one year after the later of the
original issue date of such Securities, the original issue date of the issuance of any additional securities and the
last date on which the relevant issuer or any affiliate of the issuers was the owner of such Security (or any
predecessor of such Security) and, in the case of Securities offered to non-U.S. persons in accordance with
Regulation S, 40 days after the later of the original issue date of such Security and the date on which such
Security (or any predecessor of such Security) was first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined
in Rule 902 of Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S only (i) to the issuers, the guarantors or any
subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities
Act, (iii) for so long as the Securities are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to
a person it reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own account or for the
account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur in offshore transactions
outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act or
(v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject
in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of
such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any
applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the
issuers’ and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) to require the
delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in
each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the
Security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will
not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date;

(6) Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

retirement account or other arrangement that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any

purchasers, or guarantors, or any of their respective affiliates, is acting as a fiduciary, or providing any

purchasers. If the purchaser is acquiring any notes (including the guarantees) as a fiduciary or agent for one or
more investor accounts, the purchaser represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each
such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and
agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes
by (a) employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”), (b) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975
of the Code or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to
such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and (c) entities whose underlying assets are
considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement described in clause (a) or (b) (each of
the foregoing described in clauses (a) (b), and (c) referred to as a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any
discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of
the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA
Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

Non-U.S. plans, U.S. governmental plans and certain U.S. church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
(as discussed below), may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with
their counsel before purchasing the notes to determine the suitability of the notes for such plan and the need for, and
the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine
whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the
Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

In addition, a fiduciary should consider the fact that none of the issuers, Investor Group, initial purchasers,
or guarantors, or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”), will act as a fiduciary to
any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold notes and none of the Transaction Parties is undertaking to
provide any advice, including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. The
Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular
investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes.
All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the notes are intended
to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the notes, and do not constitute advice regarding
the advisability of investment in the notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the notes must
be made by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arms’ length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA,
or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party
in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes
and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged
in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code.
The purchase and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a
party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and held in accordance with
an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of
Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the purchase and holding of
the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by


-----

independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate
accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company
general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the abovenoted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering
purchasing and/or holding the notes in reliance of these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption
to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect
their investment in the notes. Any fiduciary of a governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an
investment in the notes should consult with its counsel before purchasing notes to consider the applicable fiduciary
standards and to determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable
Similar Laws.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of
any Plan unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and
the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a note (or any interest
therein) will be deemed to have represented and warranted that (A) either (i) no portion of the assets used by such
purchaser or transferee to purchase or hold the notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) (a)
the purchase and holding of the notes by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws,
and (b) none of the Transaction Parties is acting as a fiduciary, or providing any investment or other advice, to such
purchaser or transferee with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes, and none of them shall at any time
be relied upon as a fiduciary with respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold or transfer the notes and (B) it
will not sell or otherwise transfer such notes or any interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is
deemed to make these same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase and holding of
such note or any interest therein.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it
is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the
assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and
holding of the notes.

Purchasers of the notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the
notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules
of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws. We make no representation as to whether an investment in the notes
is appropriate for any Plan in general or whether such investment is appropriate for any particular plan or arrangement.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are acting as the representatives of the
several initial purchasers of the USD notes. Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc are acting as the representatives of the several initial purchasers of the Non-USD notes. Subject to
the terms and conditions that will be contained in the purchase agreement among the issuers, the guarantors and the
initial purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers have agreed to purchase
from us, severally and not jointly, the entire principal amount of each series of notes set forth in the purchase
agreement.

The obligations of the initial purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to purchase
notes from us, are several and not joint. The purchase agreement will provide that the initial purchasers will purchase
all of the notes being sold pursuant to the purchase agreement if any of them are purchased. If an initial purchaser
defaults, the purchase agreement will provide that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers
may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated.

The initial purchasers initially propose to offer the notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover
page of this offering circular. After the initial offering, the initial purchasers may change the offering price and any
other selling terms. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates, including in
respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that any initial purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer
intends to effect any sales of the notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker
dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The initial
purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

In the purchase agreement the issuers and the guarantors will agree that:

    - The issuers and the guarantors will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any of our
debt securities that are substantially similar to the notes issued by or guaranteed by us or the guarantors
and having a term of more than one year for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering circular
without the prior consent of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC.

    - The issuers and the guarantors will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
place. In the purchase agreement, each initial purchaser will agree that:

    - The notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to
those registration requirements.

    - During the initial distribution of the notes, it will offer or sell notes only to persons reasonably believed
to be QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in
compliance with Regulation S.

In addition, with respect to the notes sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, until
40 days following the closing of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether
or not participating in this offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer
makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities
Act.

In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing
transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which
creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the notes in the
open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate covering transactions
involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short


-----

positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding
a decline in the market price of the notes or cause the price of the notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the
absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they
may discontinue them at any time. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction
as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes.

Each series of notes constitutes a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend
to apply for listing of the USD notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the USD notes in any automated
dealer quotation system. We have been advised by certain of the secured notes initial purchasers and the unsecured
notes initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the secured notes and the unsecured notes,
respectively, after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue
any market-making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for
the notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may
be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending
on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition,
general economic conditions and other factors.

We will apply, through the listing agent, for the listing of and permission to deal in the non-USD notes on
the Official List of the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained,
maintained.

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about      , 2021,
which is the      business day following the date of the pricing of the notes (such settlement cycle being referred to
as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle
in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish
to trade the notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue
of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+ , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such
trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes during such period should
consult their own advisors.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this offering, the Stabilization Managers or persons acting on their behalf, may purchase
and sell the euro secured notes, sterling secured notes or the USD notes, as applicable, in the open market. These
transactions may include over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids.
Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers.
Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or
maintaining the price of such notes.

Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession
from a broker/dealer when the notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering
transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise.

These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price
of the notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions
described above may have on the price of the notes, as applicable. In addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilization
Managers to engage in such transactions and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the
Stabilization Managers will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be
discontinued without notice. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the
notes. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of this
offering is made and, if begun, may be discontinued at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days
after the settlement date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the notes. Any stabilization action or over
allotment must be conducted by the Stabilization Managers (or persons acting on their behalf) in accordance with all
applicable laws and rules.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and
non-financial activities and services. Certain of the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have provided, and
may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the issuers and to persons and entities with relationships with
the issuers, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.

In particular, certain of the initial purchasers, or their affiliates, have provided the Bridge Credit Facilities,
for which they have been paid customary fees. The Bridge Credit Facilities will be repaid with the net proceeds from
this offering. Accordingly, such initial purchasers or their affiliates will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering. See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness". In addition, certain of the initial purchasers may receive
fees in connection with advisory work performed in connection with the G4S Acquisition and entry into the Financing
Transactions. In addition, affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers act as arrangers, agents and/or lenders under our
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and will continue to receive customary compensation in connection therewith.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of ours or our
affiliates (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise). Certain of the initial purchasers or their
affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge, and certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates
may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such
initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either
the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes
offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or financial instruments and
may, at any time, hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities
and instruments.

client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer

customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”).
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has
been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in

This offering circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the EEA
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of notes. This offering circular is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer of notes within the EEA should only do
so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or any of the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus for
such offer. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers have authorized, nor do we or the initial purchasers
authorize, the making of any offer of notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the initial
purchasers which constitute the final placement of notes contemplated in this offering circular.

approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target
market for the notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT**

To the Board of Managers of
Allied Universal Holdco LLC:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Allied Universal Holdco LLC and its
subsidiaries (the "Company"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and
2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, member’s capital, and
cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this
includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and
fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

**Auditors’ Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the
Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Allied Universal Holdco LLC and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020
and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 1. ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY

 Allied Universal Holdco LLC (“Holdco”) conducts all its operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including, Allied Universal Sideco LLC (“Sideco”), Universal Services of America, LP (“USA LP”) and USA LP’s wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). Holdco is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allied Universal Topco LLC (“Topco”). The Company provides security officer, or manned guarding, services, including specialized security officer services such as vehicle patrol, visitor management, executive protection, K-9 security services, secret and top secret cleared security professionals. In addition, the Company provides comprehensive technology solutions, including video surveillance, closed circuit television (“CCTV”) picture capture and monitoring, robot patrolling, GPS-based patrol and reporting, management of access control points and centralized security operations. The Company offers systems integration services to design, install and service fully-integrated technology-based monitoring systems, along with digital solutions and remote monitoring. The Company also offers ancillary services, including temporary and permanent staffing, event staffing and security, janitorial services, and consulting and investigation solutions. The Company, which was founded in 1965, is co-located in Santa Ana, CA and Conshohocken, PA, and conducts its operations principally through offices across the United States of America and Puerto Rico and has operations in Canada, Latin America and the United Kingdom.

 On May 2, 2016, Holdco and Topco entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger Agreement (the “Allied Agreement”) with Vigilant Holdings LP (“Vigilant”), then parent company of Allied Security Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Allied”) and an indirect subsidiary of Wendel SE, a European investment firm (the “Allied Transaction”). The closing of the Allied Transaction occurred on August 1, 2016 (“Closing Date”), at which time Vigilant was merged into Holdco with Holdco surviving. As a consequence of the Allied Transaction, Warburg Pincus LLC and Wendel SE held equal ownership interests in Topco, with Partners Group and certain members of Company management also holding ownership interests.

 On February 20, 2019, the Company announced that Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“CDPQ”), a Canadian institutional investor, agreed to make an investment in Topco, including $208.0 million of primary capital, which was contributed to Holdco. On September 18, 2019, Wendel SE announced that it had reached an agreement with CDPQ and other holders of existing ownership interests in Topco to sell part of its ownership interest in Topco to a new investment group led by Warburg Pincus LLC and an affiliate of the J. Safra Group. These transactions (collectively, the “CDPQ Transaction”) closed on December 12, 2019. Funds exchanged for ownership interest in Topco that occurred at the investor level are not reflected within these consolidated financial statements. As a consequence of the CDPQ Transaction, while CDPQ holds a significant but non-controlling ownership interest in Topco, the new investment group led by Warburg Pincus LLC maintains a controlling interest in Topco, with certain members of Company management also holding ownership interests. On April 29, 2020, Wendel SE sold its remaining ownership interest in Topco to the new investment group led by Warburg Pincus LLC.

 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Principles of Consolidation—The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements present the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Results of operations of businesses acquired are included from their respective dates of acquisition.

 The Company records the impact of its minority member’s interests in one of its subsidiaries as a non- controlling interest. The non-controlling interest is presented in the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss as an increase or reduction to net income or loss to arrive at the net income or loss attributable to the Company. The non-controlling interest is also shown as a separate line item in member’s capital in the consolidated balance sheets.

 Certain amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the Company’s previously reported financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 Estimates—Management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 COVID-19—The Company continues to closely monitor developments related to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic to assess any potential impact on its business. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance will depend, in large part, on the effect on its workforce, clients and vendors, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be predicted. In March and early April 2020, the Company experienced a mid-single digit percent reduction in billable service hours from its pre-COVID-19 period of January and February. However, hours stabilized beginning in late April, with hours increasing such that by the fourth quarter of 2020, hours were closer to January and February levels, but hours remained slightly down compared to 2019. The Company has also seen growth in margins, particularly during the second and third quarters of 2020, which offset the impact of the loss of hours, mainly as a result of an increase in premium services, lower overtime, reduced security professional turnover and reduced travel. Additionally, during March 2020, the Company borrowed $500.0 million under the ABL Credit Facility out of an abundance of caution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. After not using any of the additional cash provided by this borrowing, the Company repaid the $500.0 million in full during August 2020. While the Company currently does not anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a materially adverse impact on its business, as a result of the evolving and highly uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, no assurance may be made regarding potential exposure or the indirect effects of the outbreak on the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. 

 On March 27, 2020, the U.S government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which, among other things, contains numerous income tax provisions. The CARES Act allows the Company to defer the payment of the employer share of social security taxes for

 the period beginning March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Based on the CARES Act, the Company deferred $282.0 million of qualified payroll tax payments as of December 31, 2020, of which, $141.0 million is recorded within accrued payroll and related taxes and $141.0 million is recorded within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The current portion of this liability is due by December 31, 2021 with the remainder due by December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company was able to deduct additional Section 163(j) interest carryforward amounts as a result of the increase in the limitation provided by the CARES Act. The Company will continue to monitor future guidance issued regarding the CARES Act to determine any future impacts.
 On December 27, 2020, The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”) was signed into law. The CAA clarifies and expands the Paycheck Protection Program loans and the Employee Retention Credit as well as several other tax provisions first outlined in the CARES Act. The CAA is currently being evaluated, however, the Company does not anticipate a material impact as a result of this legislation.

 Revenue Recognition—In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company accounts for a customer contract when both parties have approved the arrangement, the performance obligations can be identified, payment terms can be determined and it is probable the Company will collect substantially all of the consideration to which it is entitled. The Company recognizes revenue when its performance obligation is satisfied upon the transfer of control of the promised product or service to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. Revenue is recognized over time in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of the Company's contractual relationships with its clients. The Company primarily accounts for its performance obligation under the series guidance and applies the invoice practical expedient to record revenue as services are provided, given the nature of the services provided and the frequency of billing under the customer contracts. By applying the invoice practical expedient, the Company recognizes revenue in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date and for which the Company has the right to invoice the customer. The Company generally bills its customers either in advance, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. Manned guarding service revenue is generally measured based on the billable hours served by security officers and the rate per billable hour, as determined by the underlying customer contract. Janitorial and other ancillary service revenue is recognized in the month services are performed. Advance payments of $9.2 million and $9.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represent amounts received from customers in advance of performing the related services and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The underlying revenue is recognized when the Company performs the related service. Unbilled services rendered represent revenue that has been earned, but has not yet been invoiced. The Company reports revenue net of sales tax collected from customers that are then remitted to government taxing authorities. Taxes collected are recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the applicable government taxing authority.

 Revenues from video and alarm monitoring and security systems service and installation contracts are recorded as control is transferred to the Company’s clients over time, as any assets created or enhanced by the Company’s performance are controlled by the Company’s clients, there are no alternative uses for any assets created, and the Company has a legally enforceable right to payment for performance completed. Revenue is recognized using the cost-to-cost input method, which measures the percentage of total cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for each contract. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $9.7 million and $13.2 million, respectively, in prepaid and other current

 assets for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts-in-progress and $9.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on contracts-in-progress.

 Restricted Cash—The Company has balances on deposit with the Company’s insurance carriers to pay workers’ compensation claims and general liability insurance claims as they become due and an account designated for the benefit of employees, which is reserved expressly for non-comingled uniform deposit funds. Amounts in these accounts are reflected as restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

 Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts—Accounts receivable, net are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company has recorded allowances in the amount of $34.6 million and $26.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: (1) customer creditworthiness, (2) aging of accounts receivable, (3) past transaction history with the customer, (4) current economic industry trends and (5) changes in customer payment terms. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, the Company would provide additional allowances. Based on management’s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a reduction to customer accounts receivable. 

 Inventories—Inventories consist principally of purchased parts of security equipment for installation and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventories amounted to $3.7 million and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

 Income Taxes—The majority of the Company is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. As a result, its members report their share of the Company’s income or loss which has been allocated to the members under the respective membership agreements between Holdco and its subsidiaries or among its subsidiaries on their respective income tax returns. The membership agreements of the Company have provisions requiring the distribution of funds to the members in amounts sufficient for the members to satisfy their federal, state, and local tax obligations with respect to their share of Company income, subject to board approval.

 Within the Company’s financial reporting structure, several of the operating or holding company entities are treated as corporations for federal and state income tax purposes. The consolidated financial statements reflect a tax provision or benefit for the income taxes associated with these entities and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, where appropriate, related to differences between the accounting and tax treatment of items related to these entities. Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of a recorded deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount sufficient to reduce that deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

 Under the terms of the various membership agreements between entities within the Company’s financial reporting structure, the allocation of profits or losses from operating entities to the corporate members varies based on the results of operations for the year. Amounts allocated to corporate members could be material in any given year and result in material amounts of current or deferred income tax expense or benefit to be reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect a tax provision for these corporate taxes plus taxes imposed on the Company’s operating entities which are primarily minimum tax payments plus fees based on the annual gross receipts of the particular reporting entity.

 Property and Equipment—Property and equipment, including assets under capital lease, are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of each asset.

 Leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life.

 In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company reviews its long- lived assets for impairment on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the expected undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate, utilizing management’s best estimates, appropriate assumptions, and projections at the time of review. If the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows, the asset is deemed impaired, and an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair market value of the asset. No impairment was identified or recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets—The Company records goodwill as the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the net of the fair values assigned to identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, the Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually at October 1. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general conditions and industry and market conditions, changes in the products/services and regulatory and political developments, cost of doing business, overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods, other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation, and events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company would perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test as required. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then no further testing is required. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the Company would record an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill recorded. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit based on a combination of significant observable and unobservable inputs, including estimates of future operating performance. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the


-----

#### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED)

 reporting unit is less than its carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.

 The Company’s trade names have been determined to be indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets and therefore are not amortized. The Company’s finite-lived identifiable intangible assets, such as customer contracts, non-compete agreements and technology are amortized over their estimated economic lives on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For our indefinite- lived trade names, the Company also conducts an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the trade names is less than their carrying value, the Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived trade names using the relief from royalty method. The relief from royalty method measures the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such intangible assets and not having to pay a royalty for their use. Impairment would then be recognized for the difference between the determined fair value and their carrying value, if applicable. Management performs the trade name impairment test annually at October 1, regardless of the results of the goodwill evaluation. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of indefinite-lived trade names are less than their carrying values. There were no impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.

 Marketable Securities—The Company’s investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings and are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a component of interest expense, net. All of the Company’s marketable securities are classified as long-term because they support the long-term Supplemental Income Plan (“SIP”) liability and long-term deferred compensation plan liability assumed as part of the acquisition of U.S. Security Associates, Inc. (“USSA”) and include investments that do not have contractual maturities due to the nature of the investment vehicles. 

 Marketable securities consist principally of mutual funds invested in United States of America equity securities, government securities and money market funds. Unrealized gains on marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $4.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair values of the Company’s marketable securities are $51.4 million and $37.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included with deposits and other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

 Concentrations of Credit Risk—Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and trade accounts receivable that are not collateralized. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited since the Company’s revenue base is composed of a large number of customers that are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, no customer represented greater than 10.0% of total accounts receivable or revenue.

 Cash accounts at each financial institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250 thousand. The Company routinely maintains cash at several financial institutions in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash.

 Fair Value Measurements—The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.

 The Company determines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the fair value hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company applies both a market approach and income approach to determine fair value. The market approach uses pricing and other information generated by market transactions for identical or comparable assets and liabilities. The income approach seeks to identify future cash flows to be generated and compare them with a required rate of return. Assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level (least observable) input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. 

 The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined based on management’s assessment of available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, such as cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and various accrued expenses, approximates their fair value based on the short-term maturities of these instruments.

 The estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $51.4 million and $37.9 million, respectively, based on quoted market prices (Level 1). The estimated fair values of the Company’s debt instruments are estimated using current market pricing quotes (Level 2). At December 31, 2020, the estimated fair values of the Company’s first lien term loan, senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes are approximately $2,187.4 million, $2,070.5 million and $1,142.0 million, respectively, as compared to their carrying values, exclusive of discounts, premiums and related fees, of $2,197.8 million, $1,940.0 million and $1,050.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019, the estimated fair values of the Company’s first lien term loan, senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes were approximately $2,241.2 million, $1,075.6 million and $1,126.2 million, respectively, as compared to their carrying values, exclusive of discounts and related fees, of $2,220.0 million, $1,000.0 million and $1,050.0 million, respectively. 

 Insurance Reserves—The Company maintains insurance coverage, subject to certain self-insured retention limits, for workers’ compensation, general liability, employment practices liability, automobile liability and healthcare claims. Medical benefit costs for the majority of the Company’s workforce are premium-based. Costs associated with the premium-based plans equal the actual premiums paid and premiums can fluctuate. Conversely, for administrative employees and security officers not subject to premium-based coverage, the Company is self-insured and subject to self-insured retention limits. 

 The Company records its reserves for workers’ compensation, general liability, employment practices liability and automobile liability based on a third-party actuarial analysis which includes amounts adequate to cover the ultimate claim, incurred but not reported development risk and litigation defense costs. Estimates of the ultimate cost of claims are derived from the level of the Company’s insurance coverage and the Company’s retained risk of loss. The Company records a reserve for healthcare claims based upon a third-party lag study analysis. Management reviews these estimates on a quarterly basis subject to information then currently available to assess their adequacy and the propriety of disclosure. The Company adjusts the reserves, if needed, based on the results of management’s review. Assessing


-----

#### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED)

 the adequacy of these reserves is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates.

 Leases—The Company’s facilities and certain vehicles, equipment, and uniforms are leased and accounted for under the provisions of ASC Topic 840, Leases, and subsequent amendments, which require that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes. The lease term begins when the Company has the right to control the use of the property, which is typically before rent payments are due under the lease agreement. Certain facility leases contain rent escalation clauses, which are recorded on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease with the difference between actual rent payments and the straight-line rent expense recorded as a deferred rent liability. In addition, the Company has financed certain uniforms and vehicles through capital lease arrangements and has assumed capital lease obligations. The current portion of capital lease obligations is included in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, current portion, and the non-current portion of capital lease obligations is included in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, net of current portion, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized lease assets are amortized over the shorter of the economic useful life of the asset or the lease term. 

 Purchase Price Payable—As part of certain completed acquisitions, the Company has agreed to pay cash to the sellers based upon achievement of certain targets after the acquisition date. The Company evaluates the fair value of contingent consideration throughout the year and every reporting period. Changes in the fair value during the measurement period that pertain to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are recorded as measurement period adjustments to goodwill. Changes in the fair value resulting from events that occurred after the acquisition date are recorded as a gain or loss on changes in fair value of the contingent purchase consideration in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $16.3 million and $30.5 million, respectively, is reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $0 and $7.1 million, respectively, is reported in other liabilities for purchase price payable.

 Member’s Equity Unit-Based Compensation—The Company’s management incentive plans allow the Company to attract and retain employees by allowing them to retain an equity interest in and participate in the long-term growth and financial success of the Company.

 The Company accounts for its equity unit-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Under ASC Topic 718, equity unit-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the equity award and are recognized in the statements of operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The Company determines the grant-date fair value of equity unit awards using an appropriate option-pricing method. The Company recognizes the equity unit-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award and presents such expense as a separate line item under operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

 The Company uses an independent valuation advisor to assist with determining equity unit valuations for calculating equity unit-based compensation. The Company considers both the historical volatility of its peer group’s stock price, as well as implied volatilities from exchange-traded options on its peer group’s equity units, as applicable. The expected term used by the Company represents the period that the Company’s equity units are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method described in ASC Topic 718-10-30. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity unit-based awards represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent


-----

#### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED)

 uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, equity unit-based compensation could materially differ in the future.

 New Accounting Pronouncements—Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), was issued in February 2016. ASU 2016-02 provides for a comprehensive change to lease accounting. The new standard requires that a lessee recognize a lease obligation liability and a right to use an asset for virtually all leases of property, plant, and equipment, subsequently amortized over the lease term. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases: Targeted Improvements, (“ASU 2018-11”), which allows entities the option to adopt this standard prospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening equity and include required disclosures for prior periods. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Effective Dates, (“ASU 2019-10”), which amended the effective date of ASU 2016-02 and related amendments. In June 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-05 to provide nonpublic entities with an option to defer the adoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases, from annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has elected this optional deferral period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 and related amendments on its consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. While the Company has not yet determined the ultimate impact, it anticipates that ASU 2016-02 and related amendments will have a material impact on its financial position by increasing the Company’s assets and liabilities through the recognition of right-of- use assets and lease liabilities for its operating leases.

 ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), was issued in June 2016 to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods therein. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13, the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

 ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2017-04”), was issued in January 2017. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 also eliminates the requirement for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment. ASU 2017-04 should be applied on a prospective basis. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which amended the effective date of ASU 2017-04. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The


-----

 Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04 during the year ended December 31, 2020, and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations or financial position.

 ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-07”), was issued in June 2018 and supersedes the guidance in Subtopic 505-50, Equity-Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. In particular, ASU 2018-07 expands the scope of topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (which previously only included payments to employees), to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. An entity should now apply the requirements of Topic 718 to non- employee awards, except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (i.e., the period of time over which share-based payment awards vest and the pattern of cost recognition over that period). Additionally, the amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share- based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in the grantor’s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards, and clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer, or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2018-07 during the year ended December 31, 2020 and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

 ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), was issued in August 2018 and modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. Specifically, the amendments remove disclosure requirements in Topic 820 related to (1) the amount of, and reasons for, transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; (2) the policy for timing of transfers between levels; (3) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2018-13 during the year ended December 31, 2020 and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations or financial position.

 ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”), was issued in August 2018 and requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement, if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing arrangement under the internal-use software guidance in ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. ASU 2018-15 requires a customer to disclose the nature of its hosting arrangements that are service contracts and provide disclosures as if the deferred implementation costs were a separate, major depreciable asset class. ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2018-15 on its consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations and financial position.

 ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”) was issued in December 2019 and simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

 ASU No. 2020-04, (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”), was issued in March 2020 to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is elective and applies to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 was subject to election as of March 20, 2020 and can be elected for both interim and annual periods through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-04 on its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

#### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED)

 On July 12, 2019, the Company refinanced its debt (the “Refinancing”) and entered into new senior secured credit facilities (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”), which consist of (i) a $2,020.0 million seven year senior secured term loan facility (the “First Lien Term Loan Facility”) and a delayed draw term loan facility providing borrowings of up to $200.0 million (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility” and, together with the First Lien Term Loan Facility, the “Term Loan Facility”), (ii) a $300.0 million five year senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and (iii) a $750.0 million five year asset based lending credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”). The First Lien Term Loan Facility was fully drawn on July 12, 2019. Contemporaneously with the entry into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Company issued (i) $1,000.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior secured notes due 2026 (the “Secured Notes”) under an indenture dated July 12, 2019 (the “Secured Indenture”) and (ii) $1,050.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.750% senior notes due 2027 (the “Unsecured Notes”) under an indenture dated July 12, 2019 (the “Unsecured Indenture”) with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and as notes collateral agent (the “Notes Collateral Agent”). The Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes were issued in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Holders of the Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes are not entitled to any registration rights and the Secured Indenture and Unsecured Indenture are not qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.

 The proceeds from the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes were used to (i) repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the then existing 2015 facility, (ii) redeem in full all borrowings under the then existing second lien note purchase agreement, (iii) pay related fees, costs, premiums and expenses in connection with these transactions, (iv) cash collateralize, replace or provide credit support for certain existing letters of credit outstanding and (v) provide working capital and funds for other general corporate purposes (and certain fees and expenses related thereto) of the Company. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility was fully drawn on December 30, 2019 in connection with the acquisition of SOS (see Note 10).

 In connection with the Refinancing, the Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $88.3 million, which includes the write-off of existing deferred financing fees that had a carrying value of $62.4 million, $17.7 million of un-accreted original issue discount and $8.2 million of fees paid to noteholders under the former second lien note purchase agreement. In connection with the Refinancing, the Company also capitalized an additional $88.5 million of financing fees, including $59.0 million of original issue discount.

 On February 3, 2020, the Company issued an additional $540.0 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes under the Secured Indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the Trustee and as the Notes Collateral Agent. The additional Secured Notes were issued in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Holders of the additional Secured Notes are not entitled to any registration rights. In connection with the issuance, the Company capitalized $25.7 million of original issue premium. The proceeds from the additional Secured Notes were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility and provide working capital and funds for other general corporate purposes of the Company.

 During March 2020, the Company borrowed $500.0 million under the ABL Credit Facility out of an abundance of caution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. After not using any of the additional cash provided by this borrowing, the Company repaid the $500.0 million in full during August 2020.

 Business Insurance Risks (Workers’ Compensation, General Liability, Employment Practices Liability, Automobile Liability and certain Healthcare Claims) and Tax Assessment Risk

 In the normal course of operations, various legal claims are filed against the Company for which the Company maintains insurance coverage. The Company has established reserves for these claims based on insurance coverage, the risk of loss retained by the Company and management's judgment. Management does not expect the ultimate outcome of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

 The Company maintains insurance coverage, subject to certain self-insured retentions, for workers’ compensation, general liability, employment practices liability, automobile liability and certain healthcare claims. The Company reserves for all known claims and those claims that management believes have been “incurred but not reported” as of the balance sheet date based on its estimate of the ultimate cost of the claims. Management derives the estimated ultimate cost of claims from the level of the Company’s insurance coverage, its retained risk of loss, historical trends and judgment.

 At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the accrued provision for estimated claims, excluding certain healthcare claims was $351.7 million and $314.8 million, respectively, of which $96.9 million and $90.6 million, respectively, is included in accrued claims reserves, current portion and $254.8 million and $224.2 million, respectively, is included in accrued claims reserves, net of current portion within long- term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 On October 21, 2020, Security Casualty Risk Retention Group, Inc. (the “RRG”) was created and incorporated in the state of South Carolina. The RRG is designed to provide an alternative to the historical commercial insurance coverage for general liability and is directly or indirectly owned by the subsidiaries of the Company, all of which are also policy holders. The RRG is effective for selected claims originating as of and subsequent to January 1, 2021, and therefore, the RRG has no impact on the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

 In the normal course of business, the Company is audited by taxing authorities and from time to time, receives proposed tax assessments as a result of those audits.

The timing and outcome of a settlement of any proposed assessment may not always be reasonably ascertained.

#### On March 27, 2020, the U.S government enacted the CARES Act. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which, among other things, contains numerous income tax provisions. The CARES Act allows the Company to defer the payment of the employer share of social security taxes for the period beginning March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Based on the CARES Act, the Company deferred $282.0 million of qualified payroll tax payments as of December 31, 2020, of which, $141.0 million is recorded within accrued payroll and related taxes and $141.0 million is recorded within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The current portion of this liability is due by December 31, 2021 with the remainder due by December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company was able to deduct additional Section 163(j) interest carryforward amounts as a result of the increase in the limitation provided by the CARES Act. The Company will continue to monitor future guidance issued regarding the CARES Act to determine any future impacts. 

 On December 27, 2020, The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”) was signed into law. The CAA clarifies and expands the Paycheck Protection Program loans and the Employee Retention Credit as well as several other tax provisions first outlined in the CARES Act. The CAA is currently being evaluated, however, the Company does not anticipate a material impact as a result of this legislation.

 The Company’s largest deferred tax liability relates to amounts ascribed to the value of stock in corporate subsidiaries where the underlying assets and liabilities of the corporation (primarily, partnership interests holding intangible assets, including goodwill) have been revalued under GAAP but not for tax purposes. The remaining deferred tax liability substantially relates to the difference in fair value and net tax value of intangibles created when the Company acquired USSA and SOS (See Note 10).

 Operating Loss and Tax Credit Carryforwards

 At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s operating subsidiaries had net operating loss carry- forwards of approximately $43.1 million and $24.8 million, respectively, in various jurisdictions. The Company’s net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. The Company also has tax credit carry- forwards available to offset future tax liabilities of approximately $14.4 million and $16.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which have various expiration dates but begin to expire in 2035. 

 Valuation Allowance

 Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of a recorded deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount sufficient to reduce that deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. Management believes that future results will be sufficient to realize the Company’s deferred tax assets with the exception of certain foreign tax credits (“FTC”) which were generated pre-acquisition by USSA. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, a valuation allowance of $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, has been established against federal deferred tax assets related to these FTCs. Based on available evidence, including management projections, the Company does not expect to be able to utilize the FTCs in future years. 

 Uncertain Tax Positions

 The Company files U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax returns. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are in accordance with the accounting standard, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Tax returns for years beginning in 2016 are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and various tax authorities. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. 

 Uncertain tax positions are reviewed annually with guidance provided in ASC 740 for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that directly or indirectly affect amounts reported in financial statements. ASC 740 also provides accounting guidance for the related income tax effects of individual tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds required in order for any part of the benefit of that tax position to be recognized in an entity’s financial statements. 

 At December 31, 2020 and 2019, a total of $0 and $0.4 million, respectively, was reserved on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to uncertain tax positions.
 14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 The Company is party to an Investor Management Agreement with certain funds and vehicles affiliated with Warburg Pincus LLC pursuant to which the Company receives certain administrative and management services. In exchange for these services, the Company incurred management fee expense of $6.8 million and $5.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

 15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 The Company has evaluated subsequent events through February 26, 2021, the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.

 On January 5, 2021, the Company published an offer document regarding its previously announced agreement with the board of directors of G4S plc (“G4S”) on a recommended cash offer to acquire the issued and outstanding shares of G4S, an international provider of security services, for 245 pence in cash for each share of G4S, representing a total value of all share capital of G4S of approximately £3.8 billion. The transaction is expected to close in April 2021, subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permitted) of certain conditions, including valid acceptance of the transaction by holders of 75% (or such lesser percentage as the Company may decide) of G4S shares, and the completion of certain regulatory approval and clearance processes.

 On January 16, 2021, the Company completed a purchase of the outstanding equity interests in SecurAmerica, LLC, SecurAmerica Corporation and ERMC LLC (collectively, “SecurAmerica”) for a preliminary purchase price subject to certain post-closing adjustments of approximately $352 million. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, SecurAmerica is a provider of security, asset protection and janitorial services with offices located throughout the United States. In connection with the purchase of SecurAmerica, the Company also deposited $31.5 million into an escrow account to fund the future purchase of substantially all of the assets of SecurAmerica TN LLC and ERMC TN LLC (collectively, “SecurAmerica TN”). Also based in Atlanta, Georgia, SecurAmerica TN is a provider of security and janitorial services. The transaction is expected to close during 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

  - the parent company statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020;

  - the parent company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and

  - the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

**Separate opinion in relation to international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it**
**applies in the European Union**
As explained in note 2 to the group financial statements, the group, in addition to applying international accounting standards in conformity
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has also applied international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to
Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.

In our opinion, the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards
adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to
the group.

Other than those disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the parent company
or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC

For the year ended 31 December 2020

**Our audit approach**

**Overview**
Audit scope

- Our audit included a full scope audit of the group’s Americas region and a further 28 country components across the remaining four

regions within the group. In total this resulted in full scope audits of the complete financial information in 40 country components across
17 countries due to their financial significance to the group.

- In addition to the full scope audits specific audit procedures over significant balances and transactions were performed at a further 10

country components to give appropriate coverage of all material balances.

- Taken together, the components at which either full scope audit work or specified audit procedures were performed accounted for

71% of the consolidated revenue and 73% of the consolidated profit before tax.

Key audit matters

- Goodwill impairment (group)

- Onerous contract provisioning (group)

- Uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets (group)

- Provision for material litigation (group)

- Disposal accounting (group)

- Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities (group)

- Income statement presentation (group)

- Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (group and parent company)

- Going concern risk arising from change of control (group and parent company)

Materiality

- Overall group materiality: £25m (2019: £18.5m) based on consideration of the appropriate revenue and adjusted profit before tax

materiality benchmarks of 0.5% and 5% respectively and applying judgement to select an appropriate amount within this range. The
overall materiality of £25m represents 0.36% of revenue and 7.7% of adjusted profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2020.

- Overall parent company materiality: £9m (2019: £10.5m) based on 0.8% of net assets (2019: 1% of net assets).

- Performance materiality: £18.75m (group) and £6.7m (parent company) represents a 25% haircut from overall materiality.

**The scope of our audit**
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.

**Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud**
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect material misstatements
in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is
detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations
related to but were not limited to compliance with competition laws, payroll laws and regulations, foreign ownership rules and tax laws and
regulations, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also
considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act
2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk
of override of controls) and determined that the principal risks were related to posting of inappropriate journal entries to manipulate financial
results and potential management bias in accounting estimates. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the
component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures
performed by the group engagement team and/or component auditors included:

- Discussions with management, internal audit, group general counsel, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non
compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;

- Assessment of matters reported on the group’s whistleblowing helpline and results of management’s investigation of such matters;

- Challenging assumptions made by management in their significant accounting estimates, including onerous contract provisions, carrying

value of goodwill, the recognition and measurement of litigation provisions and contingent liabilities, uncertain tax positions and
deferred tax assets and the valuation of the defined benefit obligations (see related key audit matters below); and


-----

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC

For the year ended 31 December 2020

- Testing of material journal entries and post-close adjustments, including the testing of unusual account combinations and consolidation

journals.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not
detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

**Key audit matters**
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud)
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Disposal accounting and going concern risk arising from change of control are new key audit matters this year and provision for material
litigation has replaced the previous key audit matter on non compliance with laws and regulations - specifically in relation to the SFO
investigation and compliance with payroll laws and regulations in India and the US. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent
with last year.

|Key audit matter|How our audit addressed the key audit matter|
|---|---|
|Goodwill impairment (group) Refer to Audit Committee report on page 36 and to note 16 of the group financial statements. The group has £1.3bn of goodwill at 31 December 2020 (2019: £1.4bn). An impairment charge of £58m has been recorded in 2020 (2019: £291m). Management determines the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (“CGU”) as the higher of value in use (“VIU”) or fair value less cost of disposal (“FVLCD”). The group has over 100 CGUs. The carrying value of goodwill is contingent on future cash flows and there is risk if these cash flows do not meet the group’s expectations that the assets will be impaired. The impairment reviews performed by the group contain a number of significant assumptions including revenue growth, profit margins, cash conversion and long-term growth and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the headroom available in the impairment calculations.|We assessed the mathematical accuracy of management’s goodwill impairment model and agreed the underlying forecasts to board approved budgets and strategic plans and assessed how these budgets were compiled. We identified a sample of CGUs for testing based on the materiality of the goodwill balance, where limited headroom was identified in management’s cash flow model or where the CGU was identified to be at risk due to known performance or macroeconomic conditions. For each CGU selected for testing we critically assessed management’s forecasts by comparing forecast growth to historical growth or actual performance, applying sensitivities to future cash flows and assessing long term growth assumptions against IMF projections. We considered the reliability of management’s forecasting for revenue, profit and cash conversion by comparing budgeted results to actual performance over a period of three years. Where we identified significant shortfalls against budget in prior years, this informed our determination of sensitivities to apply as we formed our independent view about reasonable downside scenarios. With the support of our valuations experts, we assessed the long-term growth rates and discount rates applied by management by reference to third party information and confirmed whether they fell within a reasonable range of external market data. Where they did not, we applied our independent view of a more appropriate rate to management’s forecast. Where the recoverable amount has been assessed with reference to a valuation multiple, we assessed the appropriateness of the multiple by comparison to recent business disposals and to other third party information, with the support of our valuations experts. For those CGUs with low headroom, we performed our own sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes in the assumptions on the available headroom.|

For the year ended 31 December 2020

|Col1|The recoverable amounts of a number of CGUs including UK Facilities Management, Estonia Secure Solutions, Brazil Secure Solutions, Indonesia Secure Solutions, Chile Secure Services, Greece Cash Solutions, Global Risk Management and UK Islands Cash Solutions, were found to be sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions and we satisfied ourselves that this risk was appropriately highlighted in the disclosures in note 16. As a result of our work, we were satisfied that, in the context of the group financial statements taken as a whole, it was appropriate to recognise an impairment charge of £58m and considered that adequate disclosure has been made.|
|---|---|
|Onerous contract provisioning (group) Refer to Audit Committee report on page 36 and to note 30 of the group financial statements. Certain of the group’s contracts are long-term in nature. These contracts can be complex and incorporate penalty and key performance indicator (“KPI”) clauses in the event of non- compliance. The group is therefore required to make operational and financial assumptions to estimate future losses over periods that can extend beyond 10 years. Variability of contract penalties, underlying delivery costs and customer and subcontractor claims or disputes can put additional pressure on margins and on future contract profitability, giving rise to onerous contract provisions. The prediction of future events over extended periods contains inherent risk and the outcome of customer and sub-contractor claims is uncertain and involves a high degree of management estimation. The group has onerous contract provisions at 31 December 2020 of £21m (2019: £21m) and the net income statement charge for onerous contracts in 2020 amounts to £7m (2019 credit: £1m).|Our approach to testing complex contracts started with an evaluation of management’s process to identify and quantify onerous and at-risk contracts. Management focused on the top 25 contracts by region and on contracts with margins of less than 3%. We targeted these higher risk and larger contracts and performed scanning analytics on contract margins to identify unusual or unexpected trends. This enabled us to form an independent view as to whether management’s process had identified all onerous and problematic contracts. Having examined management’s assessment, our procedures focused on the Facilities Management business in the UK. This specifically included three PFI contracts, all of which are long-term in nature. Each of these contracts is particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions and have seen changes in provisioning levels over the last year. For each contract in our sample, we obtained and read the key contractual terms in order to ensure that revenue was recognised in accordance with these terms and that it is supported by evidence of service delivery. We read and understood the contract penalty clauses and evaluated the completeness of penalties through discussions with contract managers and reading minutes of meetings between G4S and the customer, and customer correspondence. We assessed each of the key assumptions underpinning management’s forecasts to quantify onerous contract provisions and independently sensitised management's model. We particularly considered the appropriateness of future forecasts based on past performance. We challenged any forecast cost savings and benefits of performance improvement plans by assessing evidence of their achievability, the extent to which these plans are within the group's direct control and verified any observable benefits achieved to date. We also considered alternative scenarios, inspected correspondence with counterparties and other sources, held discussions with in-house legal counsel, and read appropriate documentation to evaluate contractual claims and disputes with customers and subcontractors. We tested the appropriateness of the discount rate used to determine the present value of the provisions, ensuring that the rates used were appropriate for the risks included in the underlying cash flows. We also assessed the recoverability of dedicated contract assets, assessing the level of impairment recorded where the contract was identified as onerous. We considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable in the context of the group financial statements taken as a whole. However, we noted that the assumptions and judgments that are required to formulate the provisions mean that the range of possible outcomes is broad. We are satisfied with the group’s related disclosures of these|

|---|---|
|Uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets (group) Refer to Audit Committee report on page 37 and to notes 11 and 31 of the group financial statements. The group operates in a complex multinational tax environment and is subject to a range of tax risks during the normal course of business including transaction related tax matters and transfer pricing arrangements. Where the amount of tax payable is uncertain, the group establishes provisions based on management’s judgment of the most likely amount or based on the expected value, being the sum of the probability weighted amounts in a range of outcomes, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. At 31 December 2020, the group has recognised provisions of £31m related to uncertain tax positions (2019: £33m). In addition, the group has recognised £232m of deferred tax assets at 31 December 2020 (2019: £254m). The recognition of deferred tax assets involves judgement by management regarding the likelihood of the realisation of these assets. The expectation that these assets will be realised is dependent on a number of factors, including whether there will be sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support utilisation of these assets.|With the assistance of our local and international tax specialists, we evaluated and challenged management’s judgements in respect of estimates of tax exposures and contingencies in order to assess the adequacy of the group’s tax provisions. In understanding and evaluating management’s judgements, we considered the status of recent and current tax authority audits and enquiries, judgemental positions taken in tax returns and current year estimates, and developments in the tax environment. Where appropriate, we also read relevant documentation, including opinions from external legal counsel, to understand the legal positions reached. From the evidence obtained, we considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable in the context of the group financial statements taken as a whole. However, we noted that the assumptions and judgements that are required to formulate the provisions mean that there is a broad range of possible outcomes. We are satisfied that these judgements are adequately disclosed in note 11. In respect of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we evaluated management’s assessment of how these assets will be realised and whether there will be sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support their recognition. We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they were prepared, ensuring consistency of cash flows with those used for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. Based on our procedures, future cash flow forecasts supported the recoverability of the deferred tax assets recognised.|
|Provision for material litigation (group) Refer to Audit Committee report on page 37 and to note 30 of the group financial statements. The group is currently the subject of a Competition Authority investigation in both Belgium and the US which may result in a material penalty and reputational damage. There are also a number of other ongoing claims with potentially material exposures. There is inherent judgement associated both with assessing and quantifying probable outcomes in relation to ongoing claims and with determining any exposure (and the need for provision) in areas where legal requirements are open to interpretation. In addition, possible outcomes need to be considered for disclosure as contingent liabilities. Unexpected adverse outcomes could materially impact the group’s financial performance and financial position.|We met with the directors, management and in-house legal counsel and obtained correspondence from the group’s external legal advisors to assess the probable outcomes in relation to ongoing claims and exposures. We obtained and reviewed management’s database tracking all litigations and reconciled this to the provisions recorded in order to check for completeness of provisions and contingent liabilities. In relation to the Competition authority investigation management obtained two independent legal opinions in order to understand the range of possible outcomes and we held discussions with both lawyers in order to understand the basis for the calculations and the basis for the assumptions that had been made. From the evidence obtained, we were satisfied with: (i) the adequacy of the group’s provisions made at 31 December 2020 for the risks identified in the context of the group financial statements taken as a whole; and (ii) the appropriateness of the contingent liability disclosures given the status, materiality and likely outcome of claims and exposures in areas where legal requirements are open to interpretation.|

For the year ended 31 December 2020

_Disposal accounting (group)_

_Refer to note 15 of the group financial statements._
The sale of the traditional cash businesses to Brinks has resulted in
the group recording a material gain on disposal for the year ending
31 December 2020. Given the complexity of the agreement over
multiple territories the transaction has been completed in stages.
In addition, the results of disposed businesses were therefore
included within the group consolidation for differing periods up
until the date of disposal for each tranche.

_Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities (group)_

_Refer to note 29 of the group financial statements._
The group has UK defined benefit obligations of £2.9bn at 31
December 2020 (2019: £2.7bn), which is significant in the context
of the overall balance sheet.
The valuation of pension plan liabilities requires estimation in
determining appropriate assumptions such as salary increases,
mortality rates, discount rates and inflation levels. Movement in
these assumptions can have a material impact on the
determination of the liability. Management uses external actuaries
to assist in determining these assumptions.

_Income statement presentation (group)_

|Disposal accounting (group) Refer to note 15 of the group financial statements. The sale of the traditional cash businesses to Brinks has resulted in the group recording a material gain on disposal for the year ending 31 December 2020. Given the complexity of the agreement over multiple territories the transaction has been completed in stages. In addition, the results of disposed businesses were therefore included within the group consolidation for differing periods up until the date of disposal for each tranche.|We have reviewed the signed Share Purchase Agreements (SPA’s), referencing both the disposal proceeds and the terms of any deferred contingent consideration receivable. We have verified the cash proceeds back to source documents, including any subsequent true-ups. We have verified the net asset balances disposed for each tranche back to underlying consolidation schedules and are satisfied that they have been appropriately deconsolidated. Based on the disposal proceeds and net asset balances we have recalculated the profit on disposal, also taking into account the relevant recycling of any CTA balances. We also assessed the recoverability of receivables in relation to deferred consideration with reference to the profitability of the related disposed entity. As a result of our work, we are satisfied that the profit on disposal is correctly recorded and consider the disclosures in note 15 of the group financial statements to be appropriate.|

|Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities (group) Refer to note 29 of the group financial statements. The group has UK defined benefit obligations of £2.9bn at 31 December 2020 (2019: £2.7bn), which is significant in the context of the overall balance sheet. The valuation of pension plan liabilities requires estimation in determining appropriate assumptions such as salary increases, mortality rates, discount rates and inflation levels. Movement in these assumptions can have a material impact on the determination of the liability. Management uses external actuaries to assist in determining these assumptions.|We used our actuarial experts to assess whether the assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit liabilities for the UK were reasonable. We assessed whether salary increases and mortality rate assumptions were consistent with the specifics of each plan and, where applicable, with relevant national benchmarks. We also assessed whether the discount rate and inflation rates were consistent with our internally developed benchmarks and in line with other companies’ recent external reporting. We evaluated the calculations prepared by the external actuaries to assess the consistency of the assumptions used. We tested the census data by comparing the number of members to the triennial valuation performed in 2018 and investigated any differences. In addition we performed two-way testing of the listings of active members back to the scheme administrator records. We have reviewed the controls report of the administrator and identified no exceptions relating to members data. Based on our procedures, we noted that the discount rate assumption used is at the optimistic end of an acceptable range as a result of a change in the bond universe included within the discount rate model prepared by the group’s actuary. We assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in note 29 of the group financial statements and consider them to be reasonable.|


_Refer to Audit Committee report on page 36 and to note 3(b) of the_
_group financial statements._
The group has historically reported specific and other items
(including restructuring costs) on the face of the income
statement. Consistent with the group’s definition of adjusted
profit before interest, tax and amortisation (“Adjusted PBITA”), the
following items have continued to be disclosed separately on the
face of the consolidated income statement in 2020: net specific
items charge of £53m (2019: £13m); restructuring and separation
costs £58m (2019: £57m); gain on disposal/closure of
subsidiaries/businesses £185m (2019: loss of £5m); California class
action settlement £nil (2019: £18m credit) and Goodwill
impairment of £58m (2019: £291m). In addition, Serious Fraud
Office Deferred Prosecution Agreement charge of £52m; bid
defence charges of £34m and asset impairment of £4m have been
recorded in 2020. The treatment of specific and other separately


We substantiated the nature and quantum of significant
individual items to appropriate corroborating evidence. We
considered whether the designation of individual items as
specific was consistent with the group’s accounting policy
and treatment in prior years. Furthermore, we considered
whether amounts included as specific items related to
current year trading and might be more appropriately
reflected in the underlying results. We considered whether
the group has taken a balanced approach to this area,
checking that exceptional one-off items of income are
treated consistently with one-off items of cost. We tested
management’s process for identifying and tracking the
current year reversal of any prior year specific items, or
utilisation of or adjustment to related provisions, to identify
whether these have been appropriately presented in the
current year income statement. Based on our procedures,

|disclosed items is explained in the group accounting policy in note 3(b). We focused on this area because the classification of items as specific or separate disclosure of items of income or expenditure on the face of the income statement requires judgment and because certain of these items are excluded from the calculation of elements of executive remuneration in line with the group’s remuneration policy. Consistency in the identification and presentation of these items is important to ensure comparability of year-on-year reporting in the Annual Report.|we were satisfied that the treatment and classification of these items were consistent year-on-year and with the group’s policies.|
|---|---|
|Impact of COVID-19 pandemic (group and parent company) Refer to the Directors Report on page 54 and to note 3 of the group financial statements. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the trading of the group over the course of the year. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought increased estimation uncertainty to certain areas of the financial statements. Management therefore performed a detailed analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the group and parent company financial statements on revenue, profit and cashflows including possible cost of mitigation and relief obtained from counter-measures taken by national governments. The areas where management has given greatest attention to the accounting and disclosure implications are the impairment assessments for goodwill and property, plant & equipment and trade receivables. Furthermore, this analysis has been used in conjunction with an assessment of the group’s liquidity and disclosure of the risks of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and management to conclude on going concern and viability, and which have been disclosed within the relevant sections of the Annual Report. In addition, management’s way of working, including the operation of controls, has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of a large number of employees working remotely and using technology enabled working practices. For example, this has meant that virtual review meetings and electronic review processes (in place of hardcopy reviews) have been performed instead of meetings which were physically attended or review of hardcopy documents.|We assessed management's future forecasts and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the group’s revenue, profit and cashflows. In addition, we have considered the historical accuracy of the budgeting process to assess the reliability of the data. Based on our procedures we concluded that management’s future forecasts are appropriate. Our procedures in respect of the goodwill are covered in the “Goodwill impairment” key audit matter above. We also evaluated management’s assessment of other accounting estimates within the groups and parent company’s financial statements which could be impacted by the challenging economic environment, including the recoverability of property, plant and equipment and of trade receivables. We satisfied ourselves that management's estimates were within acceptable and reasonable ranges. In relation to liquidity we stress tested management’s model and considered to what extent sufficient headroom exists to absorb any further downside risks. Our reporting in respect of going concern is set out in the “Conclusions relating to going concern” section below and in respect of viability is set out in the “Corporate governance statement" section below. On the basis of the work performed we are satisfied that management have included appropriate disclosures within the Annual Report. In addition, we also assessed our ability to execute the audit when operating under lockdown and the related international travel restrictions. We implemented alternative communication and review protocols with management and with our component auditors. We also held planning meetings ahead of the year-end audit, involving management and certain component auditors, and agreed ways to facilitate a remote audit, including agreeing how we could ensure appropriate access to relevant audit documentation.|


_Going concern risk arising as a result of change of control (Group_
_and parent company)_

_Refer to Audit Committee report on page 38 and to note 3(a) of_
_the group financial statements._

As noted on page 2 of the Annual Report, on 6 April 2021, G4S
became a subsidiary of Atlas UK Bidco Limited, part of the Allied
Universal Security Group (“Allied”). The acquisition of the group
has triggered certain change of control rights in the group’s
borrowing agreements and this, coupled with scheduled debt
redemptions, means that approximately £2.2bn of the group’s

For the year ended 31 December 2020

the cancellation of the revolving credit facility by providing G4S
with access to a €300m revolving credit facility via Atlas UK Bidco
Limited.

In order to prepare the financial statements on a going concern
basis, G4S has obtained a ‘Deed of Undertaking’ from the new
parent group, under which Allied irrevocably and unconditionally
undertakes to provide any necessary financial support for a period
of 12 months from the date of approval of the financial
statements.

**How we tailored the audit scope**
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a
whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in
which they operate.

In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by us, as the group
engagement team, or component auditors within PwC UK and other PwC network firms operating under our instructions. Where the work
was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work in these territories to
be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial
statements as a whole.

The group is organised into four Secure Solutions reportable segments and one Cash Solutions reportable segment. Corporate head office
entities are managed at a group level. Each region (“regional component”) is an aggregation of a number of country-based components along
with the group’s interests in joint ventures (together the “country components”). Each region has a separate management team which
coordinates the businesses within that region. The group’s accounting processes are structured around a local finance function in each of
the country components. In addition, finance shared service centres in the UK, North America and India support certain of the group’s
country-based components. The country components report to the regions and to the group through an integrated consolidation system.
There are approximately 500 reporting units across all five regions, all of which are considered a country component. Our audit included a
full scope audit of the group’s Americas region and a further 28 country components across the remaining four regions within the group. In
total this resulted in full scope audits of the complete financial information in 40 country components across 17 countries due to their
financial significance to the group, including 12 entities that were directly coordinated by the Americas regional component auditor.

We also identified a further 10 country components (of which 3 were directly coordinated by the Americas regional component auditor)
which had one or more individual balances that were considered significant to the group’s financial statements. For these components we
instructed the component units to perform specific audit procedures to give us the appropriate coverage over the significant balances for
our group audit.

Furthermore, central testing was also performed on selected items (including taxation, goodwill and intangible assets impairment, treasury,
post-retirement benefits and disposal accounting) primarily to ensure appropriate audit coverage.

Where the work was performed by regional and country component audit teams, we determined the level of involvement we needed to
have in the audit work at those components. Our group and our regional component audit teams’ involvement included regular dialogue
with our country component teams, review of material component auditor work papers and participation in certain component audit
clearance meetings for the more significant country components.

Taken together, the components and functions where we performed either full scope audit work or specified audit procedures on selected
financial statement line items accounted for 71% of consolidated revenue and 73% of consolidated profit before tax. This was before
considering the contribution to our audit evidence from performing audit work at the regional and group levels, including disaggregated
analytical review procedures and our evaluation of entity level controls, which covered a significant portion of the group’s smaller and lowerrisk components that were not directly included in our group audit scope.

**Materiality**
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate
on the financial statements as a whole.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC

For the year ended 31 December 2020

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

       - 5% of adjusted profit before tax (‘PBT’), which
results in materiality of £16.2m.
Using a materiality of £25m equates to 0.36% of
revenue and 7.7% of adjusted PBT.

reflects the underlying performance of the group. We
took this measure into account in determining our
materiality, except that we did not adjust profit
before tax to add back amortisation of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and finance income and
expense as in our view these are recurring items
which do not introduce volatility to the group’s
earnings.  Solely using a profit based materiality does
not take into consideration the scale of the group,
given the relative low margins and the fact that
revenue is a key driver of the business and is
identified as a key performance indicator of the
group, alongside earnings. In our professional
judgement, we have concluded that £25m is the
appropriate level at which to set materiality, and we
have concluded that any adjustments identified that
are lower than £25m in magnitude would not be
expected to influence the decisions made by the users
of the financial statements.

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of
materiality allocated across components was between £0.3m and £22.5m. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit
materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected
misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature
and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our
performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to £18.75m for the group financial statements and £6.7m for the parent
company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and
aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £1.2m (group audit)
(2019: £1m) and £0.4m (parent company audit) (2019: £0.5m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted
reporting for qualitative reasons.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC

For the year ended 31 December 2020

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group's and the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting included:

- agreeing management’s cash flow projections to the latest Board approved forecasts, assessing how those board approved forecasts

had been compiled and assessing the accuracy of management’s forecasts;

- evaluating the key assumptions within the forecast;

- reviewing the terms of the existing debt and other facilities, specifically the impact of the change of control of the group and checking

that the key terms were applied appropriately in the going concern assessment;

- considering the potential downside sensitivities that management had applied and their likelihood and whether more severe scenarios

could apply, together with considering the associated impact on available liquidity;

- assessing management's stress testing and whether this appropriately considered the principal risks facing the business and the

likelihood of events arising that could erode liquidity within the forecast period;

- assessing the performance of the group since year-end and comparing it with the Board approved cash flow forecast;

- reviewing a signed copy of the ‘Deed of Undertaking’ obtained by the group from Atlas Ontario LP, the ultimate holding company of the

Allied Universal Security Group, and certain key Allied Group companies, to understand the level of and duration of financial support
provided;

- reviewing Allied’s cash flow projections to understand how these were compiled, the key assumptions with reference to historical

performance and assessing the accuracy of management’s forecasts;

- reviewing Allied’s debt and facility agreements and the assessment of compliance with the related covenants;

- performing general enquiries with Allied management to understand the business model, basis of budgeting and cash flow projections,

treasury management and discussion of contingencies with in-house general counsel; and

- reviewing the basis of preparation note to the financial statements and evaluating that it accurately described management's going

concern considerations.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually
or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at
least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation
of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's and the parent
company's ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the parent company’s reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to
add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form
of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears
to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act
2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as
described below.


-----

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC

For the year ended 31 December 2020

**Strategic report and Directors’ Report**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’ Report
for the year ended 31 December 2020 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit,
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors’ Report.

**Directors’ Remuneration**
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006.

**Corporate governance statement**

The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the
corporate governance statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code
specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are
described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance
statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material
to add or draw attention to in relation to:

- The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;

- The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an

explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

- The directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of

accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and parent company’s ability to
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;

- The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the group's and parent company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and

why the period is appropriate; and

- The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the parent company will be able to continue in

operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term viability of the group was substantially less in scope than an audit and only
consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment
with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial
statements and our knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the
audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate
governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

- The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides

the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and parent company's position, performance, business model and
strategy;

- The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and

- The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for
review by the auditors.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC

For the year ended 31 December 2020

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

**Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements**
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also
responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques.
However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek
to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw
a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

**Use of this report**
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by
our prior consent in writing.

**Other required reporting**

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with
the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Appointment**

Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 4 June 2015 to audit the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2015 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is six years, covering
the years ended 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2020.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**1. General information**

G4S plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, and is expected to have a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange until at
least 5 May 2021. It had a secondary listing on Nasdaq exchange until 16 April 2021. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the
financial statements of the company and entities (its subsidiaries) controlled by the company (collectively comprising “the Group”) and the
Group’s interest in joint ventures made up to 31 December each year. The Group operates throughout the world and in a wide range of
functional currencies, the most significant being the Euro, the US dollar and Sterling. The Group’s financial statements are presented in
Sterling, as the Group’s primary listing is in the UK. The address of the registered office is 5th Floor, Southside, 105 Victoria Street, London,
SW1E 6QT, United Kingdom.

**2. Statement of compliance**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards in
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to
Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union, and the accounting policies have been consistently applied. The parent
company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 – Reduced Disclosure Framework, in accordance with UK
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). These are presented on pages 159 to 169.

**3. Significant accounting policies**

**(a) Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis as described below and using the
historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and financial instruments. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below. Judgments made by the directors in the application of those accounting policies which have a significant effect
on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, are discussed in note 4.

On 26 February 2020, the Group entered into an agreement to sell the majority of its conventional cash businesses (the “Disposal Group”)
to The Brink’s Company (Brink’s) for cash consideration of approximately £666m (see note 22 for more details). Assets and liabilities of the
businesses for which the sale transaction has not completed have been included within disposal groups classified as held for sale in the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 as set out in note 22.

**Going concern**

The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance, cash flows and financial position
are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 27. In addition, note 28 to the financial statements includes the company’s objectives,
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group has considered its future funding requirements taking into account its long-term customer contract portfolio, flexible cost base,
geographically diverse operating footprint and breadth of customer industry groupings all of which mean that the Group is well placed to
manage the direct business impacts and the current global economic uncertainty arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. This consideration
has included review of the Group’s budget and business plan over a period of at least 12 months from the signing of the annual report and
sensitivity analysis and stress testing of the budget and business plan projections, including severe but plausible downside scenarios (based
on enduring Covid-19 related budget and plan shortfalls similar to those experienced in 2020 and earlier than anticipated crystallisation of
certain provisions at values above the levels currently provided), over the same period.

On 6 April 2021, G4S became a subsidiary of Atlas UK Bidco Limited, part of the Allied Universal Security Group. The acquisition of the
Group has triggered certain change of control rights in the Group’s borrowing agreements and this, coupled with scheduled debt
redemptions, means that approximately £2.2 billion of the Group’s outstanding borrowings will require repayment in 2021 and the Group’s
£650m revolving credit facility was cancelled shortly after 6 April 2021. Allied has undertaken to fund the majority of G4S’s forthcoming
borrowing repayments through £1.9 billion of intragroup lending from Allied to G4S and partially to mitigate the impact of the cancellation
of the revolving credit facility by providing G4S with access to a €300m revolving credit facility via Atlas UK Bidco Limited.

Atlas Ontario LP, the ultimate holding company of the Allied Universal Security Group, and certain key Allied Group companies (collectively
the “Allied Parties”) have entered into a Deed of Undertaking with G4S, under which the Allied Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
undertake to (and undertakes to procure that its Affiliates and Subsidiaries (excluding G4S and the Group will)):

   - provide such financial support to the Group as is required for the Company (and each member of the Group) to continue to be
able to operate as a going concern and meet its debts as they fall due;

   - not seek the early repayment of any amounts advanced to the Group by it, or any of its Affiliates, and shall only seek to refinance
the Group's existing financial indebtedness using committed funding made available on appropriate terms such that (taking into
account such alternative funding) the Company (and each member of the Group) will continue to be able to operate as a going
concern and meet its debts as they fall due; and

   - advance to the Company (and the Group) such amounts as the Company (and each member of the Group) may require in order
to ensure that the Company (and each member of the Group) is able to operate as a going concern, meet its debts as they fall
due and fulfil its day-to-day funding and liquidity needs;


-----

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

with such undertakings to remain in full force and effect for a period ending on the date falling 12 months after the date of approval of the
Group’s financial statements. As part of the Deed of Undertaking, the Allied Parties have represented and warranted the quantum and
maturity of the incremental financing facilities that have been entered into in connection with the G4S acquisition and that they will, at all
times have sufficient and available committed financing sources to meet their (and their Subsidiaries’ and the Group’s) financing
requirements for the duration of the 12 month assessment period. The Group has made enquiries to assess the information provided in
respect of the incremental financing facilities.

Having considered the assessment of the Group’s future funding requirements, sensitivity analysis and stress testing of the Group’s budget
and business plan as set out above and on the basis of the irrevocable and unconditional undertaking entered into by the Allied Parties, the
directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence and meet its liabilities
for the foreseeable future. For this reason the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
consolidated financial statements.

**(b) Presentation of the consolidated income statement**

In order to provide further clarity in the Group’s consolidated income statement and segmental analysis, the Group separately discloses
specific items, restructuring and separation costs, profits or losses on disposal or closure of subsidiaries or businesses, amortisation of
acquisition-related intangible assets and any acquisition-related expenses, and goodwill impairment. This is consistent with the way that
financial performance is measured by management and reported to the board and assists in providing a more meaningful analysis of the
Group’s results. The directors believe that presentation of the Group’s results in this way aids the understanding of the Group’s financial
performance. Further explanation about the Group’s rationale for separately presenting these items is set out in the Alternative
Performance Measures section of the Strategic Report on pages 5 and 6.

**Specific items**

The Group’s consolidated income statement and segmental analysis note separately identify results before specific items. Specific items
are those that in management’s judgment need to be disclosed separately in arriving at operating profit by virtue of their size, nature or
incidence. In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors
such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.

All items that are reported as specific items are evaluated and approved by the Group’s Audit Committee prior to being separately
disclosed. The Group seeks to be balanced when reporting specific items for both debits and credits, and any reversals of excess provisions
previously created as specific items are classified consistently as specific items.

In general, provisions recognised for future losses on onerous contracts are charged to the consolidated income statement within Gross
Profit. However, where onerous contract charges are individually significant by virtue of their size, they are separately charged within
specific items. Such losses are distinct from “in-year” losses, which are utilised against provisions for onerous contract losses. Releases of
onerous contract provisions originally charged as specific items are separately credited within specific items.

Specific items may not be comparable with similarly-titled measures used by other companies. Specific items for the current and prior
years are described in note 7.

**Other separately disclosed items**

In order to provide further clarity in the consolidated income statement, the Group also discloses separately certain strategic restructuring
costs, profits or losses on disposal or closure of subsidiaries or businesses, costs of major corporate restructurings, acquisition-related
amortisation and expenses and goodwill impairment.

Restructuring costs that are separately disclosed reflect the multi-year productivity programme which is being implemented by the Group.
This programme is of a strategic nature and, as such, is monitored and approved by the Group’s Executive Committee. Investment during
2020 and 2019 related to the 2018-2020 strategic productivity programme announced in 2017 which is being implemented across the
Group. Restructuring costs that are incurred in the normal course of business are recorded within Adjusted PBITA.

Further explanation about the Group’s rationale for separately presenting profits or losses on disposal or closure of subsidiaries or
businesses, amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill impairment is set out on page 5.

**(c) Basis of consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is achieved where the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to
direct the activities that affect the Group’s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity. This can be determined either
by the Group’s ownership percentage, or by the terms of any shareholder agreement. In the case of certain investments, detailed analysis
of the different contracts in place is required, together with a level of judgment, to ascertain whether there is control under the definition
of IFRS 10 – Consolidated financial statements (see note 4).

On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. The cost of acquisition is measured as the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred as consideration to the vendor
and does not include transaction costs. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is
recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount
on acquisition) is credited to the consolidated income statement in the year of acquisition.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

The cost of acquisition includes the present value of deferred and contingent consideration payable, including that in respect of put options
held by non-controlling shareholders, as estimated at the date of acquisition. Subsequent changes to the present value of the estimate of
contingent consideration and any difference upon final settlement of such a liability are recognised in the consolidated income statement
with respect to contingent consideration and in other comprehensive income with respect to put options. Non-controlling interests are
stated at their proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. Profits and losses are applied in the proportion of their
respective ownership to the interest of the parent and to the non-controlling interest.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective
date of control and up to the effective date of disposal, respectively.

**Joint ventures**

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in the Group’s consolidated financial statements using the equity
method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial
position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in
the value of the investment. The Group’s share of post-tax profits or losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

**Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Where a Group company transacts with a
joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant joint venture.

**(d) Foreign currencies**

The financial statements of each of the Group’s businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business. Except for
operations that have a functional currency that is hyperinflationary, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are
translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities
which are denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried
at fair value which are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was
determined. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not retranslated. Gains and losses
arising on retranslation are included in the consolidated income statement for the period.

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
their acquisition, are translated into Sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated
into Sterling at the average exchange rates for the period (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rate
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rates on the dates of the transactions).
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income, together with exchange differences arising on monetary items
that are in substance a part of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations, and on borrowings and other currency instruments
designated as hedges of such investments where, and to the extent that, the hedges are deemed to be effective. On disposal, translation
differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.

Current year transactions of operations that have a functional currency that is hyperinflationary are stated in terms of the value of money
at the end of the current reporting period and are translated by applying relevant closing exchange rates. Prior year comparatives
presented in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of financial position are not restated for changes in the value
of money or exchange rates. Any adjustments arising on the restatement of transactions and balances in the year to the value of money at
the end of the current reporting period are included within finance costs.

**(e) Intangible assets**

**Goodwill**

Business combinations are accounted for by the application of the acquisition method. Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the
excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at
the date of acquisition of a subsidiary or joint venture. No goodwill arises on the acquisition of an additional interest from a non-controlling
interest in a subsidiary as this is accounted for as an equity transaction. Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses,
and is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired. On disposal of a subsidiary
or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

**Acquisition-related intangible assets**

Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the date
of acquisition. Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer contracts and customer relationships.
The fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets is determined by reference to market prices of similar assets, where such information
is available, or by the use of appropriate valuation techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess earnings method.

Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic life. The directors review
acquisition-related intangible assets on an on-going basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.


-----

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The estimated useful life of an intangible asset that arises from contractual rights is limited to the length of the related contract unless the
contract is renewable and there is evidence to support renewal of the contract without significant cost to the Group. The estimated useful
lives of the Group’s acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows:

Trademarks and technology up to a maximum of five years

Customer contracts and customer relationships up to a maximum of ten years

**Non-acquisition-related intangible assets**

Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services, systems and products of the Group. Development
expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only if the following can be demonstrated: the expenditure creates an identifiable asset, its
cost can be measured reliably, it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits, it is technically and commercially feasible, and
the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. In all other instances, the cost of development expenditure is recorded
directly in the consolidated income statement.

Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to be revenue-producing, up
to a maximum of ten years. The directors review the capitalised development expenditure on an on-going basis and, where appropriate,
provide for any impairment in value.

Research expenditure is charged to the consolidated income statement in the year in which it is incurred.

Capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is charged on software
so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic
lives, up to a maximum of ten years.

**(f) Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is
provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of the assets
to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives (having taken into consideration
any impact of climate change which is concluded as having no material impact) as follows:

Freehold buildings up to 50 years

Equipment and motor vehicles 2 to 10 years

Where significant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are re-assessed annually.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful economic life of the leased asset unless it is
reasonably certain that the lessor will transfer the asset to the Group, in which case the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful
economic life of the leased asset as described in note 3(r) below.

**(g) Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.

The Group classifies its financial assets (except derivatives) in the following measurement categories:

   - Those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss. This category includes investments; and

   - Those to be measured at amortised cost. This category includes trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.

The Group classifies its financial liabilities (except derivatives) as measured at amortised cost.

Fair values are classified by reference to the inputs to the valuation technique used to derive them, using the following hierarchy:

Level 1 – inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – inputs are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly but are not quoted prices included in Level 1;
Level 3 – inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting**

Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value as financial assets or
financial liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated income statement unless
they are designated as hedges. The accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are
designated as hedges depends on the nature of the hedging relationship as described below.


-----

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

**(g) Financial instruments continued**

**Fair value hedges**

The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for fair value changes attributable to the risk being hedged. Changes in the fair value of
both the hedging instrument and the fair value of the risk being hedged are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

**Cash flow hedges**

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the cash
flow hedge reserve within equity. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

Amounts accumulated in equity are re-classified to the consolidated income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects
profit or loss.

Any cumulative deferred gains or losses along with any deferred costs of hedging that have been recorded in equity at the point at which a
hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, remain in equity
until the forecast transaction occurs. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, any cumulative gains or losses and deferred
costs of hedging that are recorded in equity are immediately re-classified to the consolidated income statement.

**Net investment hedges**

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar manner to cash flow hedges. Any gains or losses on the
hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in
reserves in equity. Any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated any accumulated deferred gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging in equity
at that time remains in equity as part of the total gain or loss.

Total gains and losses accumulated in equity are re-classified to profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of in whole or in part.

**Cost of hedging**

The currency basis spread is a margin that is present in a cross currency derivative that is not present in a hedged item that is a single
currency exposure. As such, when designating a cross currency derivative as a hedging item and measuring the effectiveness of the hedge,
the Group excludes the currency basis spread. Additionally, when cross currency swaps are designated in a net investment hedge to
manage the spot-to-spot exposure of net assets, forward points inherent in the derivative are also considered to be a cost of hedging.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges or cash flow hedges which relate to the currency
basis spread or forward points described above are recognised in other comprehensive income and included in the cost of hedging reserve
which is a component of equity.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value which, unless there is a significant financing component, represents the amount of
consideration that is unconditional. Trade receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less
loss allowances. Loss allowances are calculated using the simplified approach to determine expected credit loss rates taking into account
payment profiles over a period of 36 months before the balance sheet date and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced
within this period. The expected loss rates are adjusted for current and forward-looking local economic and market conditions.

**Investments**

Investments comprise investments in securities and certificates of deposit which are measured at fair value both on initial recognition and
subsequently. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term call deposits.

**Interest-bearing borrowings**

Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the consolidated income
statement on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are not interest-bearing, are stated initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

**Equity instruments**

Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

**(h) Inventories**

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of business
in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads. Cost is calculated using either the
weighted average or the first-in, first-out method. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be
incurred to completion and disposal.


-----

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**(i) Impairment of non-financial assets**

The carrying values of the Group’s non-financial assets, with the exception of inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indication of impairment and, if any such indication exists, the assets’ recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment
loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a
change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount. The amount of the reversal is limited such that the asset’s carrying
amount does not exceed that which would have been determined (after depreciation and amortisation) if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

**(j) Employee benefits**

**Retirement benefit costs**

Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement
benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are
equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefits scheme.

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the present value of the
Group’s total defined benefit obligation reduced by the fair value of the related scheme assets. The total of all of the Group’s individual
schemes that are in a net asset position is presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position. The value of any net
asset recognised for a defined benefit scheme is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to
the scheme.

For defined benefit plans, the cost charged to the consolidated income statement consists of current service cost, net interest cost, and
past service cost. The finance element of the pension charge is shown in finance expense and the remaining service cost element is
charged as a component of employee costs in the consolidated income statement. Actuarial and other re-measurement gains and losses
are recognised immediately in full within other comprehensive income.

**Share-based payments**

The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value of equity-settled share-based
payments is determined at the date of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting
period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, excluding changes resulting from any market-related
performance conditions. Cash-settled share-based payments are recognised as a liability at fair value at the date of grant. The value of the
liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date the liability is settled. Changes in the liability are recognised directly in the
consolidated income statement.

**(k) Provisions and contingent liabilities**

Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where
the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. The amount recognised as a provision is the Group’s best estimate of the likely
outflows at the end of the reporting period.

In respect of claims, onerous customer contracts and litigation, the Group provides for anticipated costs where an outflow of resources is
considered probable and a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. For all such items, the ultimate liability may vary from
the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement. Management exercises judgment in
measuring the Group’s exposures to contingent liabilities (see note 30) through assessing the likelihood that a potential claim or liability
will arise and in quantifying the possible range of financial outcomes.

Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure using an appropriate
discount rate.

**(l) Restructuring and separation costs**

A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features to
those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring,
which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the on-going activities of the
entity.

The Group distinguishes in the consolidated income statement between restructuring costs that are recurring and those that relate to oneoff or transformational Group programmes that impact a number of operations.

Recurring restructuring costs that are incurred in the normal course of business are recorded as part of the Group’s results within adjusted
profit before interest, tax and amortisation (Adjusted PBITA).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

**(m) Revenue recognition**

The Group has no revenue other than that arising from contracts with customers. For the majority of the Group’s services, including the
provision of manned security and cash security services, the Group provides services to the customer on a daily basis continuously over the
term of the contract and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group. Revenue from these
services is therefore recognised over time.

For the services set out below, the Group’s right to consideration from its customers generally equates to the value of services supplied to
the customer. On this basis, the Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 to recognise revenue when the services are provided for
the amount that the Group has a right to invoice for those services.

The practical expedient is applied to revenue recognised in the following services:

   - Secure Solutions services including the provision of on-site, mobile and remote security, technology-enabled monitoring and
response, risk consulting and integrated security solutions. In addition, most contracts for facilities management and Care &
Justice Services apply the practical expedient.

   - Cash Solutions services including the provision of conventional cash services (cash in transit, cash processing and ATM services)
and cash technology services (including some Cash 360 services and bank process automation).

The Group also provides additional services (listed below) where the Group’s right to consideration from its customers does not equate to
the value of services supplied to the customer. In these cases, mainly related to long-term contracts, revenue is recognised over time due
to either:

a. the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefit of the services; and/or
b. the Group creating an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; and/or
c. the Group’s performance not creating an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group having an enforceable right to

payment for performance completed to date.

In these cases revenue is recognised over time primarily using input methods based on costs incurred as a proportion of the total expected
costs of the contract.

The following services apply this method of revenue recognition:

   - Secure Solutions services including the provision of security alarm installations and related on-going maintenance and
monitoring services, and certain long-term facilities management and Care & Justice Services contracts.

   - Cash Solutions services including the provision and/or rental of smart safes and cash recycling equipment, including the use of
any proprietary software.

Where installation contracts include the outright sale of equipment, revenue in respect of the sale and installation is recognised when the
equipment is installed. Where equipment cannot be sold without the provision of on-going maintenance or other services and in contracts
for the rental of equipment, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract.

On-going maintenance and monitoring services represent a series of services with a constant pattern of transfer to the customer over time.
Revenue in respect of such services is recognised over the period of the contract.

For contracts that involve the rental of equipment, the Group determines whether the arrangement constitutes a lease under IFRS 16.
Where the Group determines that a contract includes a lease, the requirements of IFRS 16 are applied for lessor accounting.

**Other transactions**

A small number of businesses across the Group provide direct sale of alarms, smart safes and other equipment sales. In these transactions,
the Group satisfies its performance obligations at a point in time. Revenue is recognised when the goods have been delivered to the
customer and title has passed.

**Other considerations**

Where a contract contains a number of distinct performance obligations, the amount of revenue recognised in respect of each is
determined by allocating the total transaction price in the contract to performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling
prices. In the small amount of cases in which the practical expedient is not applied as the Group’s right to consideration does not equate to
the value of services provided to date, the standalone selling price is estimated based on market prices where available.

Certain of the Group’s contracts include payments that vary depending on its performance, including payments or penalties that are
determined based on the Group achieving KPIs. In such cases, the amount of revenue recognised is limited to the extent that it is not highly
probable that the Group will ultimately receive payment.

In a small number of contracts, the Group procures goods or services from a third party and provides them to the end customer as part of
the overall delivery of the contract. The Group considers that it is acting as principal if it is in control of these goods or services prior to
transferring them to the customer, and an agent where it is arranging for them to be provided to the customer without obtaining control.

For the majority of the Group’s contracts, invoices are raised in the month or months after the delivery of services. Accrued income arises
in relation to services provided that have not been invoiced at the year end. For some contracts, particularly in facilities management,
construction, and Care & Justice Services activities, payments are received in advance of the performance of the related services and are
recognised within deferred income until the related services are delivered.


-----

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**(n) Contract acquisition and fulfilment costs**

The Group recognises the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer as an asset, to the extent that those costs are
expected to be recovered during the contract. Such capitalised costs are amortised over the contract term. Bid team and other costs
incurred prior to winning a contract are not capitalised but are charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred.

Contract fulfilment costs are capitalised if they relate directly to a contract; result in the creation or enhancement of an asset to be used in
the performance of that contract; and are expected to be recovered under that contract. Capitalised contract fulfilment costs are
amortised over the contract term in line with the delivery of goods or services.

**(o) Onerous contracts**

Onerous contract provisions are recognised when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the
economic benefits expected to be received under it. Management’s profit improvement plans to recover the position on loss-making
contracts require a level of judgment and are generally taken into account in the calculation of the onerous contract provision only when
implementation has commenced and tangible evidence exists of benefits being delivered. The provision is calculated based on discounted
cash flows to the end of the contract.

In general, provisions recognised for future losses are charged to the consolidated income statement within net specific items. Where
onerous contract provisions are individually material by virtue of their size, they are separately charged within net specific items.

In-year operating losses from onerous contracts are accounted for as a utilisation of the related provision for future losses. Any excess or
shortfall to the initial estimate for onerous contract provisions is credited or charged in the consolidated income statement to achieve
consistent presentation with the original charge.

**(p) Interest**

Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. This is the
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset’s net carrying amount. Borrowing
costs, also calculated using the effective interest method, are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement.

**(q) Income taxes**

Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it
is recognised through other comprehensive income. The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax, and excludes
charges for interest on tax and certain penalties on tax settlements, which are reported within finance expenses and administration
expenses respectively.

Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income statement
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that their recovery is probable, having regard to the projected future taxable income of these entities
and after taking into account specific risk factors that affect the recovery of these assets. The same profit projections are used for these
purposes as are used by the business, for example in assessing the carrying value of goodwill. Judgment is applied on a case-by-case basis
due to the jurisdictional nature of taxation. This analysis is considered afresh at each balance sheet date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of potential deferred tax assets is re-assessed at each balance sheet date and recognised to the extent that it is
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow those assets to be recovered.

Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated due to changes in tax legislation, differing interpretations of tax legislation and
uncertainties surrounding the application of tax legislation. In situations where uncertainties exist, provision is made for tax liabilities and
assets on the basis of management judgment following consideration of the available relevant information. Further detail on
management’s judgments in respect of taxation is provided in note 4.


-----

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

**(r) Leases**

The Group recognises an expense in respect of short-term leases (being those with an initial term of 12 months or less) and leases of lowvalue items (defined as leases of assets with a cost, when new, of less than £2,500) on a straight line basis over the life of the lease. For all
other leases, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is made available
for use by the Group.

Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the future lease payments including fixed payments, in-substance fixed payments,
and variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, less any lease incentives receivable. The Group applies the practical
expedient to include non-lease components in the measurement of lease liabilities. Lease liabilities also take into account amounts payable
under residual value guarantees and payments to exercise options to the extent that it is reasonably certain that such payments will be
made. The payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease or, where that cannot be measured, at an incremental borrowing rate
determined based on publicly available data for liabilities with matching start dates, terms and currencies, adjusted for the country-specific
risk of the lessee. No adjustment is made to reflect the nature of the leased assets on the basis that a lender would not make a material
adjustment to the borrowing rate to reflect the nature of the underlying assets.

Lease assets are measured based on the value of the associated lease liability, adjusted for any payments made before inception and initial
direct costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group records an interest charge in respect of the lease liability. The related right-of-use
asset is depreciated over the term of the lease or, if shorter, the useful economic life of the leased asset unless it is reasonably certain that
the Group will acquire the asset at the end of the lease in which case it is recognised over the asset’s useful economic life. Lease liabilities
are adjusted for changes to the future cash flows due under the lease (for example, changes based on movements in indexes or rates) with
a corresponding adjustment typically made to the associated asset.

**(s) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations**

Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs
to sell.

Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal
group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. For the sale to be highly probable, the Group must be committed to the sale
at the period end and it should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.

A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of
operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria
to be classified as held for sale.

**(t) Dividend distribution**

Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid or approved by the shareholders in a
general meeting.

**(u) Government grants**

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and
the group will comply with all attached conditions. Note 7 provides further information on how the group accounts for government grants.

**(v) Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations**

**Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 in respect of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform**

The Group adopted the Phase 1 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 in respect of Interest Rate Benchmark (IBOR) Reforms early, with
effect from 2019. These amendments provided relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedge relationships directly
affected by IBOR reform and have the effect that the reform should generally not cause hedge accounting to terminate. The reliefs in the
amendments will cease to apply when the uncertainty arising from IBOR reform no longer exists. There was no financial impact from the
early adoption of these amendments. Further amendments (Phase 2) were issued on 27 August 2020 and the Group will apply these in
2021.

There was no material effect from the adoption of any other new standards or interpretations in the year ended 31 December 2020,
which included:

   - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle;

   - IFRS 9 amendments – Prepayment features with negative compensation;

   - IAS 28 amendments – Long term interests in associates and joint ventures;

   - IFRS 3 amendments – Definition of a business; and

   - IAS 1 and IAS 8 amendments – Definition of material.

**New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective**

The Group has not early-adopted any other standard, amendment or interpretation in the year. A number of new standards, amendments
to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2020. The directors are currently evaluating the
impact of the following new standards on the group financial statements:

   - IAS 16 amendments – Proceeds before Intended Use;

   - IAS 37 amendments – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract; and

   - IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**4. Accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, with respect to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.

**Significant judgments**

Significant judgments are those made by management when applying its accounting policies that are considered to have the most
significant impact on amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

Those judgments that are considered to have the most significant impact on amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements,
apart from those involving estimations (which are disclosed separately below), are the following:

**Compliance with foreign ownership rules and consolidation of subsidiaries**

The Group has a diverse set of complex ownership structures, which are sometimes driven by local laws and regulations relating to foreign
ownership. In some instances the Group operates through local structures with limited direct share ownership of the business but
exercises control through shareholder agreements.

Judgment is required in determining whether certain Group entities qualify for consolidation under IFRS10 – Consolidated Financial
Statements, and in some instances professional and legal advice is sought to support these judgments. Consolidation of any of these
entities would be at risk if the Group’s ability to enforce its rights of control was successfully challenged.

These judgments have been applied in determining how the Group consolidates businesses with an aggregated revenue of c.£670m,
Adjusted PBITA of c.£50m and equity shareholders’ funds of c.£80m. The impact on the Group’s earnings (after tax) of equity accounting
rather than full consolidation would not be material.

**Leases (treatment of extension or termination options)**

The Group has in excess of 1,000 property leases within its portfolio. Many of those leases include options to extend or terminate early.
Where that is the case, the Group is required to exercise judgment to determine whether it is reasonably certain that the lease will be
extended (or not terminated early). Where options are held by both the lessor and lessee, judgment is required to determine whether the
options can be exercised at no cost.

The Group makes such judgments on a lease by lease basis taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, including the purpose
of the options, forecast business requirements, and the time until the option is exercised. Generally, the Group assumes that it is
reasonably certain that leases of assets that are used to serve a sales contract will continue until the end of the sales contract but that
future renewals of sales contracts are not reasonably certain.

At 31 December 2020, £2m (2019: £16m) of potential future lease payments were not reflected in the Group’s lease liability because the
Group was able to avoid payment by exercising termination options (or not exercising renewal options) and it was not reasonably certain
that payment would be required.

**Significant estimates and assumptions**

Significant estimates and associated assumptions are those that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Significant estimates are made taking into account historical experience and
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including current and expected economic conditions,
and, in some cases, actuarial techniques. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.

The most significant estimates, assumptions and sources of uncertainty in preparing the Group’s 2020 consolidated financial statements
are set out below:

**Onerous contracts**

The Group delivers certain long-term services that are complex in nature. Some of the contracts to deliver these services may evolve to
become loss-making, such that net unavoidable losses are expected to be incurred over their life.

Where a contract is expected to be loss-making over its remaining term, the net present value of estimated future losses is determined in
order to calculate an onerous contract provision. The identification and measurement of such provisions is subject to inherent risk, given
the extended time periods often involved and the number of variables which are not all within the Group’s control.

   - In particular, estimation is required in assessing future expected revenue and costs on such contracts, including:

   - determining the expected impact of any profit improvement plans where sufficient evidence exists of benefits being delivered by
those plans;

   - determining the expected outcome of any contractual or commercial disputes; and

   - determining an appropriate inflation and discount rate to apply to material future cash flows.

The level of uncertainty in the estimates and assumptions supporting expected future revenues and costs can vary with the complexity of
each contract and with the form of service delivery.

128.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**Carrying value of goodwill**

The Group tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired. The
impairment analysis is based principally upon forecasts of discounted estimated future cash flows arising from the use and eventual
disposal of the assets, requiring assumptions about growth rates and the impact of local economic factors. In some cases, the impairment
analysis is based on fair value less costs to sell which requires assumptions about how much a willing buyer would be willing to pay for the
business. During the year the Group recognised a total goodwill impairment charge of £58m, reflecting impairments in Brazil Secure
Solutions (£26m) respect of the Global Risk Management business (£15m), Chile Secure Solutions (£9m) and Greece cash Solutions
business (£8m). A description of the Group’s approach to impairment testing, including an analysis of the sensitivity of goodwill to the key
assumptions, and details of impairments recorded during the year is presented in note 16.

**Leases (estimation of discount rates)**

The Group’s lease liabilities are calculated by discounting future lease payments using the rate implicit in the lease or, if that cannot be
readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate at the date at which the leases were entered into or modified. The Group has
calculated almost all of its lease liabilities using incremental borrowing rates. Those rates have been estimated based on publicly available
rates for borrowings of the same tenure, start date and currency, adjusted for the Group’s credit rating and for the credit rating of the
Group entity entering the lease. Determining the rate at which an individual entity could borrow funds on the same terms as an individual
lease requires significant estimation.

The average incremental borrowing rate used for leases that were in place during the year ended 31 December 2020 was 5.32% (2019:
5.18%). If the incremental borrowing rates used at 31 December 2020 were decreased by 100bps in respect of all of the Group’s leases,
then the Group’s lease liabilities would increase by approximately £6m (£5m relating to land and buildings and £1m to property and
equipment) with a consequential effect on right-of-use assets. An increase of 100bps would decrease the Group’s lease liabilities by
approximately £6m (£5m relating to land and buildings and £1m relating to property and equipment). An increase/decrease in the
incremental borrowing rates of 100bps would increase/decrease the Group's interest charge for the year ended 31 December 2020 by
approximately £1m/£1m respectively.

**Taxation**

The Group operates in many tax jurisdictions including countries where the tax legislation is not consistently applied and under some
complex contractual circumstances where the responsibility for tax arising is not always clear. Judgments and estimates are required to
determine the appropriate amount of tax to provide for and any required disclosure around contingent tax liabilities at each period end.

Provisions for tax liabilities are estimated for existing matters under dispute with local tax authorities, as well as for matters which it is
considered may be disputed by them, where it is probable that a future liability will arise. The tax liability provided is management’s best
estimate, taking into account external advice, the anticipated position of the relevant tax authorities, and other local factors. In certain
cases, and where appropriate, a probability weighting is applied in determining the amount provided. In all cases it is assumed that the
local tax authorities have, or will be provided with, full information. Further details about the range of the potential tax exposure to which
the Group is subject are set out in note 11.

The Group has tax losses and other deductible temporary differences, mainly in the UK and USA, that have the potential to reduce tax
payments in future years. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that their recovery is probable, having regard to the projected
future taxable income of these entities and after taking into account specific risk factors that affect the recovery of these assets. The same
profit projections are used for these purposes as are used by the business, for example in assessing the carrying value of goodwill.
Judgment is applied on a case-by-case basis due to the jurisdictional nature of taxation. This analysis is considered afresh at each balance
sheet date.

**Valuation of retirement benefit obligations**

The valuation of defined retirement benefit schemes is arrived at using the advice of qualified independent actuaries who use the
projected unit credit method for determining the Group’s obligations. This methodology requires the use of a variety of assumptions and
estimates, including the determination of an appropriate discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, mortality assumptions,
future service and earnings increases of employees, and inflation. Full details of the Group’s retirement benefit obligations, including an
analysis of the sensitivity of the calculations to the key assumptions, are presented in note 29.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**Labour laws, commercial agreements and claims**

The Group is involved in disputes in a number of countries, mainly related to activities incidental to its operations. Currently there are a
number of such disputes, including collective labour claims open in relation to the application of local labour law, commercial agreements
with customers and subcontractors, and claims and compliance matters, in some cases in the course of litigation. In addition, the
interpretation of labour laws and regulations in a number of countries where the Group operates is complex and there is an inherent
judgment made when applying those laws and regulations that are open to interpretation. As such, there is a risk that further disputes and
claims from employees could arise in the future.

Where there is a dispute (or where there is a risk of a dispute on claims in the future) and where, based on legal counsel advice, the Group
estimates that it is probable that the dispute will result in an outflow of economic resources, provision is made based on the Group’s best
estimate of the likely financial outcome. For further details of how the Group has applied judgments and estimates to these provisions and,
where relevant, an analysis of the sensitivity of the provisions to the key underlying estimates and assumptions, refer to note 30 on pages 127
to 130.

In certain instances it is not possible to determine a reliable estimate or a reasonable range of potential outcomes. For these cases,
disclosure of the relevant items as contingent liabilities is provided in note 30.

**Fair value of break fee**

On 8 December 2020 the Group entered into a co-operation agreement with Allied. The terms of the agreement required the Group to pay
a sum of £38m to Allied, to be held in escrow, in the event that Allied failed to acquire the Group. The Group concluded that the cooperation agreement contained a financial liability in respect of the possible future outflow because the success of Allied’s bid was outside
of the control of the Group. In accordance with IFRS 9, a financial liability is required to be recorded at fair value on initial recognition. The
fair value of the potential £38m liability would take into account the probability of the out flow arising.

As at 31 December 2020, the Allied offer had been unanimously recommended by the G4S plc Board, the directors of which had
irrevocably undertaken to accept the offer in respect of their own shares. In contrast, the Board had unanimously recommended that
shareholders reject the ‘Increased and Final Cash Offer’ issued by GardaWorld on 2 December 2020. The directors assessed the probability
of a future outflow arising in the light of the recommended offer and concluded that it was virtually certain that Allied would be successful
in acquiring the Group. On that basis, the fair value of the liability was determined to be immaterial. If the probability of Allied succeeding
had been lower then an additional liability and income statement expense of up to £38m would have been recognised.

On 6 April 2021, G4S became a subsidiary of Atlas UK Bidco Limited, part of the Allied Universal Security Group resulting in G4S plc being
released from any potential obligation to pay the break fee and the amount held in escrow in this respect was repaid on 9 April 2021.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**16. Intangible assets continued**

**Goodwill**

A significant portion of the Group’s goodwill was generated from the merger of the security services businesses of Group 4 Falck and
Securicor in 2004, which was accounted for as an acquisition of Securicor by Group 4 Falck.

**Goodwill impairment testing**

The Group tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that it may be impaired. The
Group’s annual impairment test compares the carrying value of goodwill and other relevant non-current assets held by each cashgenerating unit (CGU) with the recoverable amount of each CGU as at 31 December each year. An impairment is recognised when the
recoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying value of goodwill and other relevant non-current assets.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGUs which are expected to benefit from that business combination. The
Group has identified CGUs for goodwill impairment testing purposes on a country-level basis with each country divided into separate Cash
Solutions and Secure Solutions CGUs where applicable. The CGUs are consistent with the way in which the Group’s Chief Operating
Decision Maker reviews performance.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is generally determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash flow calculations. The
key inputs to the calculations are described below. If market prices can be ascertained (for example through recent transactions, by
reference to normal industry standard multiples, or by using future forecast cash flows discounted to current value), and fair value less
costs to sell exceeds the value in use, then fair value less costs to sell measured on a basis consistent with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
is used to determine the recoverable amount (as described in note 3(g).

**Forecast cash flows**

All operating countries in the Group produce a budget for the next financial year (i.e. for the year ending 31 December 2021) and forecasts
for the four years following the budget year (i.e. for the years ending 31 December 2022 to 31 December 2025) for both their Secure
Solutions and Cash Solutions businesses. The budgets and forecasts are reviewed at segment and group level and are approved by the
Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The budgets and forecasts form the basis of the estimated future cash flows used in the Group’s
impairment test.

The key assumptions that are made in determining the Group’s budget and forecasts vary between CGUs. However, they typically include
assumptions about the Group’s ability to win and retain work (particularly as its existing contracts come to an end); the margins that will be
achieved; and the Group’s ability to control its fixed cost base. In making those assumptions, management assesses current run-rates,
adjusted for known wins and losses and for expected changes in market conditions.

In undertaking the Group’s impairment tests, the budgets and forecasts approved by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker are
adjusted to the extent that events since they were developed (for example, the subsequent loss of contracts) indicate that they may no
longer be achievable. In making such adjustments, particular attention is given to the final two years of the forecasts to ensure that the
increased uncertainty inherent in the forecasts in later years and any additional risk affecting the forecast results for those years are
adequately reflected.

Terminal values are projected by applying growth rates based on country-specific long-term inflation rates. Estimated future cash flows are
discounted using country-specific risk-adjusted discount rates as described below.

**Discount rates**

The following key inputs are used to calculate country-specific discount rates for all CGUs:

**Input** **How determined**

Risk-free rate (Group) The Group’s risk-free rate is based on the UK government's 20 year gilt/bond rates.

Adjusted risk-free rate (country specific) Country-specific risk-free rates are derived for each CGU by adjusting the Group’s risk-free rate
for both the relevant inflation rate differential between the UK and that CGU’s country and by
applying an appropriate country-specific risk premium sourced primarily from the IMF and New
York University websites as well as other studies by independent economists.

Unleveraged beta Beta is a risk adjustment applied to the discount rate to reflect the risk of the Group’s
operating companies relative to the market as a whole. The Group’s beta is estimated by
performing an analysis of comparable multi-national listed companies and is adjusted for the
appropriate leverage of the Group.

Debt margin The Group applies a Group-wide debt margin to the country-specific risk-free rates to obtain a
cost of debt for each CGU. The debt margin is determined by calculating the premium between
the yield on a BBB- rated 15+ year UK benchmark bond and the UK risk-free rate.

Weighted-average cost of capital (pre-tax) The weighted-average cost of capital is calculated by weighting the cost of equity and the cost

of debt by the applicable debt to equity ratio at the year end.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**16. Intangible assets continued**

**UK Facilities Management**

The UK Facilities Management business provides facilities management services including cleaning, catering, maintenance and other
management services to schools, hospitals and other customer sites across the UK. Goodwill was £39m at 31 December 2020 (2019:
£39m). The key assumptions supporting the value in use calculations are forecast cash flows based on 2021 budgets and plans for 2022 to
2025, a discount rate of 7.6% (2019: 8.2%) and a long-term growth rate of 2.0% (2019: 2.0%). The value in use exceeded the carrying value
of the CGU by £55m (2019: £nil) as the business recovered from the unexpected loss of a major contract in late 2019 which represented a
significant decline in the scale of that business.

The forecast cash flows are driven by assumptions around PBITA, which have been derived by assuming that existing contracts at 31
December 2020 will continue to be renewed unless the business has been notified of their loss or termination and that revenue and profit
will increase in line with UK inflation. During the year ended 31 December 2019, the business recorded a goodwill impairment of £40m
following the unexpected loss of a major contract that represented a significant decline in the scale of that business.

If the anticipated decline in PBITA between 2022 and 2025 accelerated by 10% and the long-term growth rate after 2025 was reduced to
zero, headroom would decline to £20m. Similarly, if in isolation the discount rate was increased from 7.6% to 10.6% this would result in
headroom declining to £14m.

**Estonia Secure Solutions**

The Estonia CGU provides manned guarding and monitoring systems within Estonia. Goodwill was £27m at 31 December 2020 (2019:
£26m). The recoverable amount of £43m (2019: £52m), which exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by £8m (2019: £19m), is based on fair
value less costs to sell since that was greater than its value in use, calculated using a Level 3 measure by applying a multiple of 7.5x
budgeted 2021 EBITDA (2019: 10.0x budgeted 2020 EBITDA on an IAS 17 basis).

The multiple of 7.5x was determined with reference to management’s experience of recent transactions and publicly available data about
global valuations of security businesses. A fall in the multiple to 6.1x would result in the headroom becoming eroded to £nil. The budgeted
EBITDA for 2021 was developed through a bottom-up process based on the closing run-rate of the business in 2020. In the event that the
business fails to achieve its budget, then a reduction in budgeted PBITA of 51%, or £1.1m, would result in the carrying value of the CGU
equalling its recoverable amount.

**Brazil Secure Solutions**

The Brazil Secure Solutions CGU provides manned guarding, security and monitoring services and systems. The business recorded a
goodwill impairment of £26m (2019: £35m) during 2020, fully impairing the goodwill held by the CGU. The impairment arose primarily
from management’s re-assessment of the ongoing business environment in Brazil against a background of continuing challenging trading
conditions in that country and an ongoing adverse macro-economic environment.

Goodwill was £nil at 31 December 2020 (2019: £32m). The recoverable amount of £5m at 31 December 2020 has been based on fair value
less costs to sell, since this was greater than its value in use, calculated using a Level 3 measure by applying a multiple of 7.5x budgeted
2021 EBITDA. The multiple of 7.5x was determined with reference to management’s experience of recent transactions and publicly
available data about global valuations of security businesses. A fall in the multiple to 6.0x, which management believe would be reasonably
possible, would result in an additional impairment of approximately £1m to the other non-current assets within the CGU. The budgeted
EBITDA for 2021 was developed through a bottom-up process based on the closing run-rate of the business in 2020, adjusted to exclude
the effect of one-off items incurred in 2020 and for known or expected changes in the business in 2021. In the event that the business fails
to achieve its budget, then a reduction in budgeted EBITDA of 50%, or £0.3m, which management believes is reasonably possible in the
light of experience with the business in 2020, would result in a further impairment of the CGU of approximately £3m.

During the year ended 31 December 2019, the business recorded a goodwill impairment of £35m following a rapid and unforeseen decline
in its performance reflecting continuing challenging trading conditions in that country, an adverse macro-economic environment expected
to continue for a prolonged period and a step-change in the cost base of the businesses. As a result, the recoverable amount of the Brazil
Secure Solutions CGU at 31 December 2019 of £43m was determined based on fair value less cost to sell, since that was greater than its
value in use, calculated using a Level 3 measure by applying a multiple of 10.0x budget EBITDA on an IAS 17 basis of £4.3m. Management
determined the multiple of 10.0x based on publicly available data about multiples obtained for recent support services transactions.

**Indonesia Secure Solutions**

The Indonesia Secure Solutions business provides security services within Indonesia. Goodwill was £20m at 31 December 2020 (2019:
£21m). The key assumptions supporting the value in use calculations are forecast cash flows based on 2021 budgets and plans for 2022 to
2025, a discount rate of 12.5% (2019: 11.0%) and a long-term growth rate of 4.9% (2019: 3.0%). The value in use exceeded the carrying
value of the CGU by £10m (2019: £9m).

The forecast cash flows are driven by assumptions around PBITA and are particularly sensitive to the business’ ability to achieve its 2020
budget, which is, in turn, dependent on the business being able to return margins to historic levels achieved prior to 2019. If it is unable to
return PBITA to historic levels then the goodwill may become impaired.

In particular, if in isolation, either the forecast growth in PBITA falls by 33% in all periods or the discount rate was increased from 12.5% to
16.1% then the headroom will become eroded to £nil. If anticipated average PBITA growth up to 2025 is halved, which management
believe is reasonably possible in the light of experience in 2020, then a goodwill impairment of £11m would arise.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**Chile Secure Services**

The Chile Secure Solutions business provides security services within Chile. The business recorded a goodwill impairment of £9m (2019:
£nil) during 2020, fully impairing the goodwill held by the CGU. The impairment arose primarily from management’s re-assessment of the
ongoing business environment in Chile, which remains challenging and has resulted in the loss of some key contracts.

Goodwill was £nil at 31 December 2020 (2019: £9m). The recoverable amount of £1m at 31 December 2020 has been based on fair value
less costs to sell, since this was greater than its value in use, calculated using a Level 3 measure by applying a multiple of 7.5x budgeted
2021 EBITDA. The recoverable amount at 31 December 2019 of £13m, which exceeded the carrying value by £2m, was calculated using
value in use based on forecast cash flows using 2020 budgets and plans for 2021 to 2024, a discount rate of 10.4% and a long-term growth
rate of 3.0%.

The multiple of 7.5x was determined with reference to management’s experience of recent transactions and publicly available data about
global valuations of security businesses. A fall in the multiple to 6.0x, which management believe would be reasonably possible, would
result in an additional impairment of approximately £1m to the other non-current assets within the CGU. The budgeted EBITDA for 2021
was developed through a bottom-up process based on the closing run-rate of the business in 2020, adjusted to exclude the effect of oneoff items incurred in 2020 and for known or expected changes in the business in 2021. In the event that the business fails to achieve its
budget, then a reduction in budgeted EBITDA of 50%, or £0.1m, which management believes is reasonably possible in the light of
experience with the business in 2020, would result in a further impairment of the CGU of approximately £1m.

**Greece Cash Solutions**

The Greece Cash Solutions CGU provides cash solutions services in Greece and did not form part of the Cash Solutions sale to Brink’s. The
business recorded a goodwill impairment of £8m (2019: £nil) during 2020, fully impairing the goodwill held by the CGU. The impairment
arose primarily from management’s re-assessment of the future performance of the business in light of the decrease in the size of the
business as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Goodwill was £nil at 31 December 2020 (2019: £8m). The recoverable amount of £7m (2019: £16m), which equals the carrying value of the
CGU (2019: exceed the carrying value of the CGU by £1m), is based on fair value less costs to sell since that was greater than its value in
use, calculated using a Level 3 measure by applying a multiple of 10.8x budgeted 2021 PBITA (2019: 10.8x budgeted 2020 PBITA).

The multiple of 10.8x was determined with reference to the recent Brink’s transaction. A fall in the multiple to 8.0x, which management
believe would be reasonably possible, would result in an additional impairment of £2m to the other non-current assets within the CGU. The
budgeted PBITA for 2021 was developed through a bottom-up process based on the closing run-rate of the business in 2020, adjusted to
exclude the effect of one-off items incurred in 2020 and for known or expected changes in the business in 2021. In the event that the
business fails to achieve its budget, then a reduction in budgeted PBITA of 50%, or £0.3m, which management believes is reasonably
possible in the light of experience with the business in 2020, would result in a further impairment of the CGU of approximately £3m.

**Global Risk Management**

The Global Risk Management CGU provides security and consulting services in Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa. The business recorded a
goodwill impairment of £15m (2019: £nil) during 2020 arising from management’s re-assessment of the future performance of the
business following significant declines in trading volumes, partly as a result the Covid-19 pandemic, which are expected to take a significant
period to recover

Goodwill was £20m at 31 December 2020 (2019: £35m). The key assumptions supporting the value in use calculations are forecast cash
flows based on 2021 budgets and plans for 2022 to 2025, a discount rate of 14.8% and a long-term growth rate of 2.9%. The value in use
equalled the carrying value of the CGU at 31 December 2020.

The forecast cash flows are driven by assumptions around revenue and PBITA margins and assume significant revenue growth, a return to
profitability in 2021 and year-on-year increases in PBITA margins over the period to 2025. Should the forecast revenue growth fail to
materialise or the business fail to return to the more usual PBITA margin that is included in the forecast, then further impairments may
occur.

In particular, if in isolation, either forecast PBITA falls by 20% in all periods which management believes is reasonably possible in light of
experience in 2020, or the long-term growth rate after 2025 was reduced to zero, or the discount rate was increased from 14.8% to 17.8%
then a goodwill impairment of £7m would arise.

**UK Islands Cash Solutions**

The UK Islands Cash Solutions business provides cash Solutions services in Jersey and Guernsey and did not form part of the Cash Solutions
sale to Brink’s. Goodwill was £15m at 31 December 2020 (2019: £15m). The key assumptions supporting the value in use calculations are
forecast cash flows based on 2021 budgets and plans for 2022 to 2025, a discount rate of 7.6% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. The
value in use exceeded the carrying value of the CGU by £3m.

The forecast cash flows are driven by assumptions around revenue and PBITA margins which are expected to remain similar to those
achieved in the year ended 31 December 2020. Should the forecast revenue fail to materialise or the business fail to maintain historic
PBITA margins then the headroom would decline.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**28. Financial risk** _continued_

**Capital management**

In March 2020, Standard & Poor’s re-affirmed the Group’s long-term credit rating at BBB- (stable). The Group’s policy is to continue to
manage its capital structure to retain an investment-grade rating.

The Group’s policy objective is a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of between 2.0x and 2.5x. At the end of 2020 the ratio was 2.32x
(2019: 2.88x).

In May 2020 the Group issued £300m of commercial paper maturing in May 2021 paying 0.65% (see note 24).

Following the sale of the majority of the Group’s conventional cash business, the Group reduced the amount available to draw under the
Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’) by £100m to £650m. In June 2020 the Group also exercised the second option to extend the term of the
RCF by a further year, resulting in £136m maturing in 2024 and £514m maturing in 2025. As at 31 December 2020 this facility was undrawn
(2019: £240m drawn down).

The Group also cancelled the undrawn bridge facility which had been reduced from £300m to £200m in March 2020

The debt maturities in 2020 comprise the $75m US private placement notes repaid in July 2020. Overall the debt portfolio has a medium to
long-term debt maturity profile and the Group remains well placed to access finance from the debt-capital markets and from the bank
market. Borrowings are principally in Sterling, US Dollars and Euros reflecting the geographies of the Group's significant operational assets
and profits.

The committed bank facilities and the private loan notes are subject to a financial covenant of 3.5x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio
(where Adjusted EBITDA is based on Group Adjusted PBITA before depreciation and amortisation of non-acquisition-related intangible
assets) adjusted to exclude investments and the effect of adopting IFRS 16 – Leases. Non-compliance with the covenant may lead to an
acceleration of maturity.

During the 2020 and 2019 reporting periods the Group has complied with the financial covenants of its borrowing facilities and has not
defaulted on, or breached, the terms of any material loans.

On 6 April 2021, G4S became a subsidiary of Atlas UK Bidco Limited, part of the Allied Universal Security Group. The acquisition of the
Group has triggered certain change of control rights in the Group’s borrowing agreements and this, coupled with scheduled debt
redemptions, means that approximately £2.2 billion of the Group’s outstanding borrowings will require repayment in 2021. The Group’s
£650m revolving credit facility, which was undrawn as at 31 December 2020, was also cancelled in full on the 13 April 2020 as required
under its change of control clause and is no longer available to draw. Allied has undertaken to fund the majority of G4S’s forthcoming
borrowing repayments through £1.9 billion of intragroup lending from Allied to G4S and partially to mitigate the impact of the cancellation
of the revolving credit facility by providing G4S with access to a €300m revolving credit facility via Atlas UK Bidco Limited.

**Liquidity risk**

The Group mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring there are sufficient undrawn committed facilities available to it. For more details of the
Group’s bank overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes see note 24.

The percentage of the available committed Revolving Credit Facility that was undrawn during the course of the year was as follows:

31 December 2019 68%

31 March 2020 46%

30 June 2020 100%

30 September 2020 100%

31 December 2020 100%

To reduce re-financing risk, Group Treasury obtains finance with a range of maturities to minimise the impact of a single material source of
finance terminating on a single date. The risk is further reduced by opening negotiations either to replace or extend any major mediumterm facility at least 12 months before the maturity date.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The next funding valuation as at 5 April 2021 is currently in progress and is expected to be completed during 2021. Allied Universal have
agreed to pay a one-off cash lump sum of £50m into the pension schemes once this funding valuation has been agreed, followed by annual
contributions of £80m per annum for the calendar years 2021 to 2026 inclusive.

In addition, the company pledged to the Pension Scheme a share of the proceeds arising from the sale of a material part of the Group, with
material for these purposes defined as being in excess of 10% of the Group's consolidated total assets. The proportion of the sale proceeds
due to the Pension Scheme is to be calculated in terms of the amount by which the divested total assets exceed 10% of the Group's
consolidated total assets and the proportion that the Pension Scheme actuarial deficit bears to overall group indebtedness. On 26th
February 2021 the company agreed and paid £18m to the Pension Scheme in respect of this pledge.

The Group has concluded that it should allow for a refund of any residual surplus in all three sections of the UK pension scheme assuming
wind-up after all benefits have been paid in the normal course of events. Therefore no adjustments for asset ceiling or additional liabilities
under the IFRIC 14 interpretation are made. At present the GSL section has a surplus and the other two sections have deficits. The IASB
recently decided not to proceed with changes to IFRIC 14 proposed in 2015 but has not stopped its IFRIC 14 project. The Group will assess
whether there are any implications should any revised interpretation be developed.

**Principal risks**

The Group’s pension schemes create a number of risk exposures. Annual increases in benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme
to scheme, dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels (including the
impact of inflation on future salary increases) and the actual longevity of the membership. Benefits payable will also be influenced by a
range of other factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms.

**Principal risks** _continued_

A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the
contributions to the pension plans. For the UK funding valuation those assumed investment returns (for funding valuations) are set based
on fixed margins over the gilt yield curve. The management of the UK pension fund assets has been delegated to an asset manager, who
manages the assets against a liability benchmark. The key parameters of this mandate can be summarised as follows:

Risk Description Mitigation
Asset mix The plan assets may fall in value. The assets are managed dynamically over time rather than a set
strategic allocation.


Interest rate risk The plan assets may fall in value as a result of a
fall in interest rates.

Inflation risk The plan assets may fall in value as a result of rise
in inflation.

Currency risk Any plan assets held in foreign currencies
are exposed to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates.

Regulatory risk All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant
jurisdictions. These include extensive legislation
and regulatory mechanisms that are subject to
change and may impact the Group’s pension
schemes.


Actuarial
assumptions risk


Actuarial assumptions made on a range
of demographic and financial matters that are
used to project the expected benefit payments
including future inflation, salary growth and life
expectancy. The DBO and service cost are also
very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which
determines the discounted value of the projected
benefit payments. The discount rate depends on
market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.


Managed with the benchmark of hedging 100% of these risks as a
percentage of the asset value through the use of debt instruments
(government bonds) and derivatives.

Managed with the benchmark of hedging 100% of these risks as a
percentage of the asset value through the use of debt instruments
(government bonds) and derivatives.

Managed with the objective of hedging at least 70% of the
overseas currency exposure in the portfolio through the use of
forward foreign currency contracts.

G4S monitors changes in regulations in the UK and the
Netherlands to assess the potential impact these changes could
have on the Group’s material pension schemes.

The UK pension trustees have adopted investment strategies to
mitigate changes in key assumptions applied to the valuation of
pension liabilities for funding purposes. These strategies mainly
hedge against interest rate and inflation expectations generally, as
described above, but do not specifically seek to hedge against
changes in credit spreads that also affect the IAS 19 discount rate.
As a result the difference between the market value of the assets
and the valuation of the pension obligations under IAS 19 may be
volatile.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**Restructuring**

Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in acquired businesses and
discontinued operations. The timing of settlement of restructuring provisions is uncertain but is generally expected to be within one year of
the balance sheet date. During the year the Group incurred net restructuring costs of £37m (2019: £19m) within administration expenses
relating to the multi-year strategic productivity programme across the Group. In addition, the Group incurred non-strategic reorganisation
costs of £12m (2019: £11m) which are included within Adjusted PBITA.

**Claims**

Claims provisions represent any outstanding litigation claims against the Group that are considered likely to lead to the outflow of funds in
the future, including provisions within the captive insurance companies to cover (where appropriate) anticipated claims incurred as at the
balance sheet date, based on actuarial assessments to calculate the liabilities.

Additional provisions in the year in respect of claims include a £43m charge in respect of costs and potential financial penalties which might
arise in respect of the ongoing investigation by the Belgian Competition Authority and the US Department of Justice Antitrust Division in
connection with the Group’s Belgian business, as explained below and a charge of £51.5m in relation to the Deferred Prosecution
Agreement with the UK’s Serious Fraud Office (“SFO”) which was announced on 10 July 2020. The charge reflects a financial penalty of
£39m, plus £6m for the settlement of the SFO’s full investigation costs and £7m of legal and other costs in relation to the Deferred
Prosecution Agreement. The claim was settled in August 2020.

The Group’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries primarily in Guernsey and the US underwrite part of the Group’s Cash Solutions,
general liability, workers’ compensation, directors and officers and auto liability policies. In the year the Group provided £23m (2019:
£20m) in relation to claims made under these policies which comprise a significant number of unrelated claims, most of which are
individually immaterial. Claims provisions cover a wide range of claims or possible claims and are subject to regular actuarial review and
adjustment as appropriate. Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the final settlements and their timing
are dependent upon the outcome of on-going processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of each claim.

**Onerous customer contracts**

The Group recognised an expense in relation to additional onerous contract provisions of £7m (2019: £5m) relating primarily to anticipated
losses in respect of two UK Care & Justice Services contracts. The provision at the end of December 2020 represents the anticipated total
losses in respect of these two contracts together with two smaller PFI contracts that are expected to run for the next 15 to 20 years.

The onerous contract provision includes items that are subject to commercial and/or contractual disputes and may be subject to early
termination, penalty clauses, or other contractual penalties. Whilst the outcome of such contracts is inherently uncertain, the Group is
satisfied that it is unlikely that changes in these contracts will have a material impact on the Group’s overall provision in the next
12 months.

Management believes that the current level of provision is balanced and that any significant potential downside from possible changes to
key assumptions could be offset by further progress made in those profit improvement plans that have not been considered following the
Group’s policy described above. The discount rates applied when calculating onerous contract provisions for these contracts were between
0% and 1%.

**Property and other**

Included within property and other provisions are the costs of replacing, reinstalling or rectifying assets where there is a present
contractual requirement, and for customer claims on contracts that are related to the performance on a contract but do not form part of
onerous customer contract provisions. Whilst settlement of these obligations is considered probable, there is uncertainty over their value
and duration.

Included in property and other provisions are contract-related provisions of £25m (2019: £24m) and property-related dilapidation
provisions of £9m (2019: £14m).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**30. Provisions and contingent liabilities** _continued_

**Contingent liabilities**

The Group is involved in disputes in a number of countries, mainly in respect of activities related to its operations. Currently there are a
number of disputes open in relation to the application of local labour law, commercial agreements with customers and subcontractors and
claims and compliance matters, in some cases in the course of litigation. In addition, the interpretation of tax and labour laws and
regulations in a number of countries where the Group operates is complex and there is inherent judgment made when applying those laws
and regulations that are open to interpretation. As such, there is risk that further disputes and claims from tax authorities and employees
could arise in the future. Where there is a dispute or where there is a risk of a dispute or claims in the future and where, based on legal
counsel advice, the Group estimates that it is probable that the dispute will result in an outflow of economic resources, provision is made
based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely financial outcome. Where a reliable estimate cannot be made, or where the Group, based
on legal counsel advice, considers that it is not probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources, no provision is recognised.

The Group is party to a number of on-going litigation processes, in relation to interpretation of local labour law and regulations in a number
of countries, where it is expected that these matters will not be resolved in the near future. At this stage, the Group’s view is that these
cases will either be resolved in a manner favourable to the interests of the Group or, due to the nature and complexity of the cases, it is not
possible to estimate the potential economic exposure. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, other contingent liabilities exist
where the Group is subject to commercial claims and litigation from a range of parties in respect of contracts, agreements, regulatory and
compliance matters, none of which are expected to have a material impact on the Group.

During 2019 the Group received a claim seeking damages for alleged losses following the reduction in the G4S share price in 2013. At this
point, the Group is unable to make a reliable estimate of the merit, outcome or impact of any potential litigation relating to this claim
therefore no provision has been made in respect of it.

In April 2020, the Group received requests for information from the Belgian Competition Authority (“BCA”) and the US Department of
Justice Antitrust Division (“DoJ”) in connection with the Group’s Belgian business. The BCA and DoJ inquiries are continuing and the Group
is engaging and cooperating fully with both authorities. During the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group recognised a charge of £43m
in respect of these inquiries after taking into account estimates of the potential financial penalties which might arise on completion of the
inquiry process ranging from £25m to £50m in aggregate. There is a wide range of possible outcomes in respect of these inquiries,
including the imposition of incremental financial penalties, third-party claims and/or debarment from certain tendering processes which
might lead to a potential financial impact materially outside the currently estimated range of financial penalties.

The Group is currently involved in a number of claims in India, mainly related to periods prior to 2011, in relation to the interpretation of
the basis for payments to the India Provident Fund. These disputes are currently awaiting court resolution. Based on the Group’s internal
and external legal advice, and taking into account the judgment passed by the Supreme Court of India in respect of a different Provident
Fund related question on 28 February 2019, the Group believes it has a strong legal position that will prevail in the courts such that no
economic outflow is expected to occur and hence no provision has been booked at the year end. The aggregate of the Provident Fund
related claims amount to approximately £50m.

In 2019, the Group received notification of a potential claim in the US relating to alleged payments in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2017.
At this stage the potential claim is in its very early stages. Based on the evidence available to date, the Group believes that it has a strong
legal position such that no economic outflow is expected to occur and hence no provision has been booked at 31st December 2020.

**Judgments and estimates related to provisions and contingent liabilities**

Judgment is required in quantifying the Group’s provisions, particularly in connection with claims and onerous customer contracts, which
are based on a number of assumptions and estimates where the ultimate outcome may be different from the amount provided. Each of
these provisions reflects the Group’s best estimate of the probable exposure at 31 December 2020 and this assessment has been made
having considered the sensitivity of each provision to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. The Group is satisfied that it is
unlikely that changes in these key assumptions will have a material impact on the Group’s overall provisioning position in the next
12 months.

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**(a) General information**

G4S plc (the ‘company’) is incorporated in the United Kingdom, registered in England and Wales, and domiciled in the UK. It is a public
company, limited by shares. The company’s registered office is given on page 77. The company’s principal activities during the year have
been as a holding company. The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the company’s functional currency, and in millions
of pounds.

**(b) Statement of compliance**

These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (‘FRS’) 101-Reduced Disclosure Framework.

**(c) Significant accounting policies**

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost convention, except for the
revaluation of certain financial instruments held at fair value through profit and loss, in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and
applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’)). The principal
accounting policies and measurement bases adopted are the same as those disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
including the new standards adopted, except as noted below, and have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless stated
otherwise. Judgments made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies which have a significant effect on the financial
statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, have been disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Going concern

The company’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance, cash flows and financial
position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 27. In addition, note 28 to the financial statements includes the company’s
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and
hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group has considered its future funding requirements taking into account its long-term customer contract portfolio, flexible cost base,
geographically diverse operating footprint and breadth of customer industry groupings all of which mean that the Group is well placed to
manage the direct business impacts and the current global economic uncertainty arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. This consideration
has included review of the Group’s budget and business plan over a period of at least 12 months from the signing of the annual report and
sensitivity analysis and stress testing of the budget and business plan projections, including severe but plausible downside scenarios (based
on enduring Covid-19 related budget and plan shortfalls similar to those experienced in 2020 and earlier than anticipated crystallisation of
certain provisions at values above the levels currently provided), over the same period.

On 6 April 2021, G4S became a subsidiary of Atlas UK Bidco Limited, part of the Allied Universal Security Group. The acquisition of the
Group has triggered certain change of control rights in the Group’s borrowing agreements and this, coupled with scheduled debt
redemptions, means that approximately £2.2 billion of the Group’s outstanding borrowings will require repayment in 2021 and the Group’s
£650m revolving credit facility was cancelled shortly after 6 April 2021. Allied has undertaken to fund the majority of G4S’s forthcoming
borrowing repayments through £1.9 billion of intragroup lending from Allied to G4S and partially to mitigate the impact of the cancellation
of the revolving credit facility by providing G4S with access to a €300m revolving credit facility via Atlas UK Bidco Limited.

Atlas Ontario LP, the ultimate holding company of the Allied Universal Security Group, and certain key Allied Group companies (collectively
the “Allied Parties”) have entered into a Deed of Undertaking with G4S, under which the Allied Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
undertake to (and undertakes to procure that its Affiliates and Subsidiaries (excluding G4S and the Group will)):

   - provide such financial support to the Group as is required for the Company (and each member of the Group) to continue to be
able to operate as a going concern and meet its debts as they fall due;

   - not seek the early repayment of any amounts advanced to the Group by it, or any of its Affiliates, and shall only seek to refinance
the Group's existing financial indebtedness using committed funding made available on appropriate terms such that (taking into
account such alternative funding) the Company (and each member of the Group) will continue to be able to operate as a going
concern and meet its debts as they fall due; and

   - advance to the Company (and the Group) such amounts as the Company (and each member of the Group) may require in order
to ensure that the Company (and each member of the Group) is able to operate as a going concern, meet its debts as they fall
due and fulfil its day-to-day funding and liquidity needs;


-----

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

with such undertakings to remain in full force and effect for a period ending on the date falling 12 months after the date of approval of the
Group’s financial statements. As part of the Deed of Undertaking, the Allied Parties have represented and warranted the quantum and
maturity of the incremental financing facilities that have been entered into in connection with the G4S acquisition and that they will, at all
times have sufficient and available committed financing sources to meet their (and their Subsidiaries’ and the Group’s) financing
requirements for the duration of the 12 month assessment period. The Group has made enquiries to assess the information provided in
respect of the incremental financing facilities.

Having considered the assessment of the Group’s future funding requirements, sensitivity analysis and stress testing of the Group’s budget
and business plan as set out above and on the basis of the irrevocable and unconditional undertaking entered into by the Allied Parties, the
directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence and meet its
liabilities for the foreseeable future. For this reason the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
company financial statements.

Exemptions

In accordance with section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own
income statement.

The company has taken advantage of certain disclosure exemptions in FRS 101, in part because its financial statements are included in the
publicly-available consolidated financial statements of G4S plc.

These disclosure exemptions relate to:

   - the requirements of IAS 7 – Statement of Cash Flows;

   - the statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union pursuant to
Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union;

   - new IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and which have not been applied by the company;

   - comparative information for the movements from the beginning to the end of the year in respect of intangible assets and certain
other additional comparative information;

   - information on the assumptions used in the determination of fair value and recoverable amounts of cash-generating units
containing goodwill and management’s approach to determining these amounts;

   - financial instruments disclosures required by IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures;

   - disclosures required by IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement;

   - certain related-party disclosures on key management compensation and transactions entered into between two or more whollyowned members of a Group; and

   - capital management disclosures.

Investments in subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment. The accounting policy for impairments is disclosed
in note 3(i) to the consolidated financial statements.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets primarily relate to expenditure incurred in developing the Javelin ERP system and are stated at cost, net of amortisation
and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is charged to the income statement to write off the cost of the assets by equal annual
instalments over their expected useful economic lives, up to a maximum of 10 years.

Amounts owed by/to Group undertakings

Amounts owed by/to Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Finance
income and expense are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method. The company uses
simplified approach for the impairment review of trade receivables and general approach for the loans to subsidiaries. Amounts owed by
Group undertakings are classified according to the intention of repayment of these loans.

Share-based payments

The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is
determined at the date of grant and is either expensed in income statement if it relates to employees of the company or capitalised as an
investment in the relevant subsidiary if it relates to the employees of a subsidiary company, with a corresponding increase in equity, and
amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. The
amount expensed or capitalised is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually
vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.

The company also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are recognised as a liability at fair value at the
date of grant. The value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date on which the liability is settled. The fair value
of cash-settled share-based payments is expensed in the income statement if it relates to employees of the company and capitalised as an
investment in the relevant subsidiary if it relates to employees of a subsidiary company.
