305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,231,NON-GAAP AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES,231.1,,231.1.1,,"In addition to the financial information presented in this offering circular prepared in accordance with GAAP or IFRS, as applicable, this offering circular contains “non-GAAP financial measures” and “non-IFRS financial measures,” that is, financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or IFRS, as applicable. We present Allied Adjusted EBITDA, G4S Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenue as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP or IFRS, as applicable. We define Allied Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items and certain cash expenses management considers non-recurring, unusual or otherwise not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and to reflect the full expected effect of cost reduction and profitenhancing initiatives, acquisitions, disposals and related cost and revenue synergies. Specific adjustments for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 include adjustments for transaction, integration and restructuring costs, sponsor and director fees, non-cash equity-based compensation, legal settlements and related fees, certain adjustments related to the implementation of Allied Universal’s accounting standards, loss on disposal of property and equipment, loss on early extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on disposal of businesses, and miscellaneous other non-recurring adjustments, as further adjusted to give effect to start-up costs and lease costs, profit-improvement initiatives, unrealized synergies from certain acquired businesses, management’s estimates of EBITDA from certain acquired businesses generated prior to their acquisition date, management’s estimates of EBITDA from certain businesses acquired in 2021, profits related to disposed businesses, and other non-recurring adjustments, which are described in the section entitled “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.” We define G4S Adjusted EBITDA as profit / (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items and certain cash expenses management considers non-recurring, unusual or otherwise not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Specific adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 include adjustments for transaction and integration costs, director fees, non-cash equity-based compensation, legal settlements and related fees, loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment, loss (gain) on contingent consideration, certain IFRS adjustments, start-up costs, lease costs, management’s estimates of EBITDA related to disposed businesses, constant currency exchange rate adjustments and other non-recurring adjustments described in the section entitled “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information of G4S.” Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA has been determined based on the combined statements of operations of Allied Universal and G4S for the year ended December 31, 2020 as adjusted as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” and as further adjusted to reflect certain non-recurring adjustments and unrealized synergies in connection with the Financing Transactions and ----- G4S Acquisition as described under “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.” We define Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenue as Allied Universal’s historical revenue, as adjusted to give effect to businesses acquired during 2020 and 2021 by Allied Universal, plus G4S’s historical revenue, as adjusted to give effect to revenue from businesses held for sale by G4S, onerous contracts, revenue from businesses disposed of by G4S during 2020 and 2021 and constant currency exchange rate adjustments. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring item. We present these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures because we believe they assist management and investors when analyzing our performance by providing meaningful information that facilitates the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. We recognize these measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and IFRS and there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP and non-IFRS financial measures. Some of these limitations are: - other companies may use different methods to calculate similar non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures, and the measures we present may not be directly comparable with the measures presented by these other companies as a result; - such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, on our debts; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; - such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Allied Adjusted EBITDA, G4S Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA are adjusted to reflect certain acquisitions and certain unrealized acquisition synergies anticipated to be achieved in connection therewith. We present these adjustments as they will be permitted as adjustments to “EBITDA” under the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby, although the non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures included herein may be defined differently than the corresponding terms under such indentures, and to enable investors to understand the covenants that will apply to us, and not as a projection of future results. We will be required to make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, and these cash costs are not reflected in Allied Adjusted EBITDA, G4S Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we will not fully realize such cost savings within 12 months of the completion of this notes offering, and may not do so at all. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment as a projection that we will achieve these acquisition synergies. Our ability to realize these acquisition synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries— We may not realize the expected benefits, revenue or cost synergies related to recently completed or future acquisitions” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the G4S Acquisition—We may fail to realize all of the anticipated ----- benefits of the G4S Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the G4S business.” Because of these limitations, non-GAAP and non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or as superior to, the presentation of results determined in accordance with GAAP and IFRS, as applicable. For a reconciliation of Allied Adjusted EBITDA, G4S Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP and/or IFRS financial measures, see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Combined Financial Information” and “Summary— Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information of G4S.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Allied Universal’s services span manned guarding, innovative technology systems, risk and consulting, janitorial and staffing services, integration services, and digital solutions and remote monitoring. We are responsible for providing “best-in-class” security services that allow clients to completely outsource the recruiting, screening, hiring, training, uniforming, scheduling and supervision of security officers. Our security officers work on-location at customer sites and are responsible for observing, detecting, deterring and reporting and responding to perceived, potential or actual security threats. We also provide specialized security services such as vehicle patrol, visitor management, K-9 security services, top security facility cleared security professionals, and joint security programs. We have an operational presence in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and have a growing presence in Canada, Latin America, and the United Kingdom. In addition to providing manned guarding services, we provide comprehensive technology solutions to our customers, including video surveillance, closed circuit television (“CCTV”) picture capture and monitoring, robot patrolling, GPS-based patrol and reporting, management of access control points and centralized security operations. We also offer systems integration services to design, install and service fully integrated technology-based monitoring systems, along with digital solutions and remote monitoring through our Monitoring and Response Center (“MaRC”).

Allied Universal was formed in August 2016 through the combination of AlliedBarton Security Services (“AlliedBarton”) and Universal Services of America (“Universal”), which brought together two of the leading providers in the security services industry. AlliedBarton, founded in 1957, and Universal, founded in 1965, were leaders in the industry in customer service, organic growth, customer and employee retention, accretive mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”), and had a highly complementary and diverse set of blue chip customers. The combined company became the largest provider of security officer services in North America and has continued to grow since, both organically and through M&A. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Allied Universal acquired U.S. Security Associates Holdings, Inc., a leading North American provider of security solutions, including manned security, consulting, investigations, and disaster and emergency response services. Since 2007, the company has successfully executed 72 acquisitions, including small and large tuck-ins. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Allied announced the acquisition of ----- SOS Security, LLC (“SOS Security”) which brought a complementary approach and further scale to Allied Universal. As of 2020, Allied Universal has an estimated 31% share of the highly fragmented outsourced manned guarding security services market in the United States, with a track record of growth driven both organically and through acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we had Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenues of $18,357.1 million and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA of $1,955.9 million, respectively.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,G4S Overview,9.3.1,,"G4S is a leading global security company, specializing in the provision of security services and solutions to customers around the world. G4S’s roots can be traced back approximately 120 years ago to 1901, when the guarding company Kjøbenhavn Frederiksberg Nattevagt was established in Denmark.

Through its Secure Solutions segment, G4S is a global market leader in security, providing both traditional manned-guarding and technology-enabled security solutions in addition to consultancy services and analytics to its customers. G4S uses its expertise, service delivery and integration alongside its geographic scale to differentiate the business to customers, drive outsourcing and enhance the value of traditional security services through greater use of technology. G4S officers are tailored for the specific need of each client, including the following: custom protection officers who meet stringent experience and training requirements and are prepared to step into high profile locations; upscale security officers who perform security patrols of designated areas on foot or in a vehicle; lobby ambassadors who present a professional and courteous appearance while also possessing customer service skills and focus and bank protection officers who provide visible deterrence of criminal activity at entrances of financial institutions and banking centers. Currently, technology-enabled security services represent approximately 45% of Secure Solutions revenue.

The acquisition of G4S provides Allied Universal with a unique opportunity to acquire a well-established integrated security services company with a globally recognized security services brand, and platform to increase the combined company’s top line sales and profitability. Allied Universal and G4S are two of the top five global companies in the highly fragmented security services industry based on revenue. Together, we will be a global leading company in the security services. The transaction enhances the combined company’s geographic coverage and capabilities to serve customers, especially in the core North America market, which represents approximately 70% of pro forma combined revenues. Allied Universal has a strong footprint in North America with a presence in all 50 states, and the merger with G4S creates unparalleled scale and increases density, with footprint overlap allowing the combined company to take a bestof approach to servicing clients in the various regions.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,"Increases diversification across end-markets, customers and geographies",9.5.1,,"While Allied Universal has historically focused more on the North American region, the acquisition of G4S enables Allied Universal to significantly increase its global footprint and diversify its base to operating in over 90 countries. The combination with G4S establishes Allied Universal as a global security services leader with unmatched scale and expertise in providing quality security services across a range of geographies. The combination of Allied Universal’s and G4S’s solutions and significant manned-guarding businesses will create a global one-stop-shop for customers and a business ideally positioned to lead the industry shift from traditional security officer and patrol services towards services that integrate technology solutions with manned security services. See “—Industry Overview—Security Services Technology.” Allied Universal’s decades of experience in risk advisory and consulting, investigations, executive protection and emergency response will complement G4S’s corporate risk services to provide end-to-end security solutions.

We are the trusted provider to premium accounts for clients with greater than $5 million annual revenue across multiple regions and a central point of contact for purchasing security services. Our leading global scale helps promote trust and confidence among our sophisticated customers and serves as a ----- significant differentiator versus regional competitors. The combination expands Allied Universal’s base of long tenured blue chip customers globally and uniquely positions the combined company to serve customers seeking integrated security solutions providers of scale. Allied Universal has had annual revenue retention of over 90% for the past 5 years and has minimal customer concentration with top five customers representing less than 5% of revenues. Doing business and negotiating long-term contracts through a centralized procurement division drives strong valueadded partnerships underpinned by highly sticky relationships, which increase the switching costs for our customers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,Acquisition adds density and expertise to North America technology business,9.7.1,,"The combined group will increase Allied Universal’s reach and depth of services, enhancing our leadership position and allowing us to expand internationally on current domestic accounts. While Allied Universal has an established customer base with significant density in traditional manned-guarding services, G4S will contribute to our operational scale in Retail Cash solutions and Retail Technology solutions, which have grown since launching in 2015. We see this as a new services platform, especially in our security technology services that we can cross-sell with North American customers and improve Allied Universal’s services coverage. The expansion of Allied Universal’s technology services platform capabilities will enable the combined company to offer superior client service, with greater breadth, accountability, improved efficiency and cost savings. We have competitive advantages through strong trajectory relative to competitors and potential disruptors and we transfer our knowledge and experience in the United States to deploy our abilities to compete in adjacent markets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

We estimate that the combination will unlock approximately $155 million in targeted annual cost savings once G4S is fully integrated and our cost savings initiatives have been fully implemented. Allied Universal has a strong track record of successful acquisition integration, including synergy realization. We anticipate that our disciplined management of fixed and variable operating expenses, revenue and financing synergies, as well as corporate overhead and headcount rationalization will primarily drive cost synergies. Historically, we have made a significant number of acquisitions and we have well-developed systems and processes throughout our organization to support integration efforts, resulting in more efficient synergy realization and helping drive overall margin improvement. The overlapping business functions in North America provide a significant opportunity for real estate and personnel rationalization. Due to overlapping operations, we expect significant synergies in the following areas in the North America region: general and administrative expenses, duplicative service contracts, insurance, and facilities expense. Additionally, we will be able to eliminate any expenses in functional support areas that support G4S’s status as a public listed company. Further, we believe opportunities exist to increase operating leverage through diversification across investment in capabilities, such as additional training and technology deployments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.9,Industry Overview Market Overview,9.9.1,,"The global contract security services market is large, has been stable and is expected to continue its consistent growth supported by a number of favorable trends. The US security services market was estimated to generate approximately $66 billion in revenue in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 4% to 5% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from 2021 to 2025. The US security services market for outsourced manned guarding generated over $28 billion in revenue in 2020 and grew at a 4.3% CAGR from 2017 to 2020. The security technology market in the US is also large, with revenues estimated to be approximately $17 billion in 2020, and grew slightly quicker than the manned guarding segment, at a CAGR of approximately 8% from 2017 to 2020. The market was estimated to be comprised of approximately 42% manned guarding and 25% security technology. Internationally, the security services market for manned guarding grew to $34 billion in revenue in 2020 and is expected to reach approximately $40 billion in revenue in 2025, representing an estimated compound annual growth rate of 5% from 2021 to 2025. ----- A heightened focus on security, both in the United States and globally, has been driven by high profile gun violence, domestic terrorism events, a rise in workplace incidents and both peaceful and violent protest events, which have led to increased spending on security. Our service offerings represent an important first line of defense against potential security threats. Meanwhile, mega trends occurring around the world and positive growth tailwinds in the distribution, manufacturing, healthcare and education sectors also support demand for increasing security. In addition, organizations continue to outsource their security services primarily to alleviate administrative burdens and achieve cost savings, while the compelling value proposition delivered through scale, broad service offerings and robust technological infrastructure drive them to shift to highly professionalized providers. Given the high-risk exposure of inadequate security, we believe that customers make purchasing decisions based on service quality, reliability, and reputation, rather than price alone. It has been our experience that customers seek out and maintain long-term relationships with quality providers. For example, industry switching rates have historically been between 10% to 15% on average annually, and customer retention rates are higher for large customers served under national contracts, according to a third party consulting study. Meanwhile, Allied Universal, as a scale provider, experienced below average annual customer switching rates of between 5% to 10%. We believe the industry’s stability in various economic cycles is underpinned by the recession-resistant nature of security services, resulting in limited cyclicality and customer churn. Over a ten-year period, industry growth has been consistent, and historically recession-resistant, experiencing only one year of flat-to-slightly declining growth. The impact of economic downturns on labor markets, which includes higher employee retention, and subsequently lower unbilled overtime, recruiting and training costs, historically have led to EBITDA margin expansion, which has historically been sustained during a return to economic expansion. Our experience during 2020 demonstrates the resiliency of our business model. Despite lockdowns and office closures during the COVID pandemic, security services remained an essential part of real estate management and asset protection. During this period, we also experienced a temporary shift in demand from security services in connection with retail, travel and leisure to grocery and other essential businesses. We also experienced an increase in demand for higher value-add services such as temperature screening. During the summer of 2020, protests and other civil events drove demand for our manned guarding services, providing further diversification and resiliency against office closings.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.10,Market Drivers,9.10.1,,"The US security services and security technology integration and manned guarding market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2021 through 2025. Several positive trends support this growth, including: (i) baseline expansion from building stock growth, guard penetration in existing buildings, and wage rate growth which is passed on through the mark-up model used to price security services; (ii) secular demand growth due to heightened focus on security driven by increased acts of violence and media coverage, increasing regulatory and insurance scrutiny; and (iii) increased outsourcing rate for security services. Furthermore, there is a trend toward the centralization of security programs and integration of manned guarding with technology solutions, both of which favor best-in-class national providers. As the national player with vertical markets expertise and differentiated integrated security and technology solutions, we are well-positioned to benefit from favorable industry tailwinds. ----- Globally, demand for security services has also increased steadily and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% between 2020 and 2024. Demand is driven by similar factors as in the United States as well as elevated safety and security risks and concerns driven by geopolitical events such as refuge crises, increased wealth driven by urbanization, global GDP growth, rising labor costs supporting demand for higher-value, technology-enabled, integrated security solutions and demand for higher-value service lines driven by more advanced technology capabilities.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.11,Base-Line Industry Growth,9.11.1,,"Base-line industry growth is driven by underlying economic growth, growing wage rates and increasing building stock, as each new building adds incremental demand for the security services industry. While building stock growth provides strong underlying support for the security services market, it is not necessary to sustain growth within our existing customer bases. A growing economy drives up overall wage rates, increases statutory minimum wages and provides union increases, all which are typically passed on to customers through a stable mark-up. Increased wage rates are expected to continue driving further expansion of the manned guarding market and increase revenue generation from existing clients.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.12,Growing Demand for Security Services,9.12.1,,"Security services remain critical and non-discretionary as customers overwhelmingly value the role of security officers in deterring criminal activity and other incidents, all the while providing assurance against real or perceived security threats. In cases of security incidents, customers value the officers’ ability to provide immediate response. Technology can enhance and significantly improve security but we believe there is no substitute for the physical presence of well-trained and dedicated security personnel who can respond to threats in real-time. The demand for security services continues to increase due to heightened security concerns stemming from the ongoing threat of terrorism and high profile gun violence, large protest events, heightened importance of public and workplace safety, refugee crises and the growing need to supplement services provided by the public sector. Heightened media coverage of security lapses, growing costs of disruption, and stricter security requirements by government institutions and private insurers have forced organizations to take greater responsibility for their own security.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.13,Increased Outsourcing to Third-party Providers with National and Global Scale,9.13.1,,"Currently, approximately 65% of manned security services in the United States are outsourced to professional security services firms, and this outsourcing rate is expected to increase incrementally over time. The trend toward outsourcing is expected to continue to drive growth in the industry due to the strong value proposition of contract security service providers and non-core nature of security for the vast majority of companies. Due to the growing complexity surrounding security-related issues and increased demand for vertical segment expertise and customized guarding services, outsourcing security services to “best-in-class” providers continues to be an attractive option for customers. Contract security services firms can offer customers improved security, reduced non-core administrative burden, and competitive pricing through operating leverage, each of which are compelling reasons supporting the trend toward outsourcing various business services. Outsourcing of non-core functions has not only become a corporate best practice, but also a function of the public sector as governments look to minimize cost. Outsourcing allows companies and governments to reduce labor costs and shift the administrative burden of non-core functions to third-party vendors with more experience, operating leverage, and functional area expertise. As one of the few security and facility services providers with national and global scale, we believe the combined Allied Universal and G4S business is well-positioned to benefit from the trend toward outsourcing security services. For example, we are able to address customers’ increasingly complex security needs and their preference for ----- best-in-class providers with strong reputations and vertical markets expertise, rather than local providers. In addition, as national customers increasingly seek to consolidate vendors, they build relationships with national partners that can reliably and consistently serve them across multiple regions. Finally, the increased centralization of procurement continues to drive the shift in customer decision-making from a local level to a multi-region and national level, providing an opportunity for national providers to increase customer penetration.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.14,Security Services Technology,9.14.1,,"Due to the importance of having security officers physically present to deter and quickly respond to incidents, technology has been used primarily to enhance and better enable manned security services. Security services providers such as Allied Universal and G4S continue to broaden their portfolio of services by combining value-added offerings like access controls, ID verification, video monitoring, and communications systems with traditional security officer and patrol services. Customers seek integration between manned guarding services and complementary technology solutions in order to improve and reduce the complexity of their security operations. Existing customer relationships create the ability to cross-sell services for the installation, integration and maintenance of physical technology systems that augment manned guarding services. Integrated technology solutions enhance the value delivered to customers and foster customer retention.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.17,"Consistent, Recession-Resistant Industry",9.17.1,,"The resilient nature of the security services market was demonstrated during the COVID pandemic, which reaffirmed the essential nature of services provided by Allied Universal. Early in the pandemic, security professionals were generally deemed essential by health authorities and continued to deliver security services to a range of customers. Minor business disruptions at the onset of lockdowns led to a slight pullback in hours relative to the preCOVID period. Allied Universal has so far successfully managed the pandemic and performance has been highly resilient both in top line growth and in margin expansion. Hours have since rebounded and even increased in some regions as COVID-related restrictions have eased and economic activity continues to rebound, while increased security concerns remain. Services have continued to expand as customers seek a partner to help implement and execute new policies and procedures at guarded sites, in addition to offering additional services such as temperature checks. An enhanced focus on innovative technology solutions drives further upside for security providers that offer fully integrated solutions. Allied Universal’s resilient top-line is driven by the contractual revenue streams with daily re-occurrence of services, the critical nature of security to operations, and the low cost of security services relative to the high cost of failure. The company typically benefits from rising wages as increases are passed on to clients, who generally expect a 2% to 3% annual increase in billing rates, in-line with wage growth. Tightening labor markets result in stable margins, while softer markets typically drive margin expansion as the increased supply of labor reduces the spread between bill rates and employee pay rates.

The US security services market generated approximately $66 billion in revenue in 2020, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2021 and 2025. Globally, the manned guarding market generated approximately $34 billion in revenue in 2020, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% from 2021 to 2025. The international technology security services market generated approximately $8 billion in revenue in 2020, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% from 2021 to 2025. Demand for high quality security services continues to grow through heightened focus on security, increasing public safety awareness and the growing need to supplement services provided by the public sector. The trend of outsourcing to high quality providers such as Allied Universal will continue to be supported by a compelling value proposition, increasing security complexity and centralization of security programs. There is a low risk of technology disruption as only manned security is considered an active deterrent to perceived security threats. Further, technology solutions enhance rather than displace manned guarding and Allied Universal provides customers with a best-in-class technology integrated service offering.

We have limited customer concentration, as our top 10 customers account for 10.7% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, with no customer contributing more than 1.9% of revenue during that period. Finally, we serve a variety of distinct vertical segments, none of which account for more than 11% of revenue. This end market diversification shields us from industry-specific shocks and allows us to provide vertical-specific solutions necessitated by the increasing complexity of security issues in different end markets. We also benefit from our commercial real estate customers’ diverse tenant base and most of our mall clients being considered “class A” (representing high sales per square foot), which achieve steadier foot traffic and higher guard penetration. The combined company will benefit from an expanded blue-chip client base, including a significant portion of the Fortune 500, and vertical market clients, as well as a diversified revenue mix across North America, Asia Pacific, Europe & Middle East, and Africa.

To ensure industry-leading service, we have cultivated a strong corporate culture that focuses on personal career development and we reward long-term, quality service. We offer competitive compensation with above-average security provider hourly wages, comprehensive training programs, career management tools, leadership training and performance assessment processes for managers and executives to ensure that they are attracting, engaging with, and retaining the highest quality security officers. We ensure that security professionals have the appropriate training for each client need; for example, portions of our security professionals have military service experience and CPR certification. Additionally, our commitment to the professional development of our employees has resulted in 65% of managerial positions being filled through internal promotion. Lower employee turnover rates reduce recruiting, screening, training costs and increases service quality for our customers, facilitating long-term, stable relationships. Employee culture is also a key focus at G4S, where 84% of employees reported a favorable view of the company in its 2019 global employee survey, with the results used to inform both local engagement plans and company-wide initiatives. In addition, Allied Universal has consistently been recognized for superior employee training and talent development programs. Over the past several years, we received additional awards, including Chief Learning Officer magazine’s LearningElite Award, The American Society for Training & Development Excellence in Practice Award, Chief Executive Magazine’s Best Private Companies for Leaders Award, and Orange County Business Journal’s Best Places to Work award.

The nature of our customer contracts fosters a highly visible financial model. Our recurring revenue base is supported by an above-average customer retention rate. To drive revenue growth, both companies target new client wins, in particular the expansion of the premier customers portfolio within Allied Universal, expanded scope of work and customer penetration with existing clients, added complementary technology solutions, and consistent increases in price in line with wage rate growth and the delivery of high- quality services. These organic growth drivers, coupled with our ability to execute upon accretive acquisition opportunities, have contributed to strong revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth. From 2005 to 2020, Allied Universal’s standalone organic revenue CAGR was approximately 6% and from 2017 to 2020, Allied Universal consistently grew the spread between bill rates and wage rates per hour by approximately 4.5%. Allied Universal’s disciplined acquisition strategy combined with strong organic growth has allowed us to become the fastest growing security services company in the industry while maintaining strong free cash flow generation. The combination between Allied Universal and G4S is expected to drive further topline and profitability growth through significant cross-selling and cost synergy opportunities. _Highly-variable cost structure drives predictable margins: Bill rate, which is the price we charge to our_ customers per hour per security officer, is priced as a mark-up on security officer pay rates, which is the wage we pay to security guards per hour. From 2016 to 2020, Allied Universal’s mark-up has remained constant at 1.48x. This stable mark-up reflects the strong track record of passing on cost increases to clients and expanding margins. Our ability to pass through labor costs and other variable expenses to our clients allows us to generate consistent profitability and produce cash flows with low volatility. This consistency helps us maintain stable operating margins and provides a baseline level of profitability from which further margin expansion can be achieved as we continue to increase our operating leverage and scale, while reducing general and administrative expenses. _Capital-light business model supports strong cash flow: Our minimal capital requirements and strong_ working capital management support our strong cash flow profile. Capital expenditures over the past three years were approximately 1.8% of annual revenue on average, with cash capital expenditures representing about half of such capital expenditures and the remaining portion funded through capital leases.

The expertise of each organization in serving specific end markets and geographies will increase the overall reach and ability to serve global clients across a range of industries with a host of complimentary services. Our industry-leading manned guarding services provide a platform from which to continue offering additional services. To date, we have utilized this platform to offer additional services, such as physical technology systems, including video surveillance, CCTV picture capture and monitoring, robot patrolling, GPS based patrol and reporting, online threat monitoring, and managing access control points and centralized security operation. Additionally, we also offer integration services to design, install and service fully integrated technology-based monitoring systems. Finally, we provide digital solutions and remote monitoring through MaRC. Our acquisition of Securadyne Systems (“Securadyne”) in April 2019 further strengthened our ability to consult, design, deploy, integrate and maintain electronic security systems for our customers. We believe the Securadyne acquisition provided us with the footprint and scalable infrastructure that enables us to deliver complementary security integration services to a significantly larger portion of the existing approximately 50,000 client sites where we provide manned guarding services today. In addition to system installation, maintenance, robots, and monitoring, we have integrated technology into our manned guarding services and are in the process of deploying a custom Incident Management System (“IMS”) that provides real-time incident data reporting and situational awareness information powered by artificial intelligence. The proprietary application, HeliAUS, provides in-depth incident reporting, data collection, and predictive analytics, allowing managers and clients to spot trends and react quickly, while improving workforce supervision and improving liability management. The highly scalable platform is delivered to customers via a monthly subscription and is billed directly to users as a supplement to manned guarding services.

The largely fragmented security services industry has historically provided opportunities to supplement our strong organic growth with a disciplined acquisition strategy. A large and fragmented international market, as well as relevant adjacent markets, provides additional opportunity for targeted expansion. Our approach to acquisitions has been highly methodical and focused on scale-building and infill acquisitions. Integration occurs quickly, generally within 30 days for a typical tuck-in acquisition, making for a seamless transition for customers. ----- Allied Universal has proven experience executing all types of transactions, including 72 small tuck-ins and large transformational acquisitions since 2007.

As of the date of this offering circular, we have incurred secured bridge loans in the amounts of $900,000,000, $775,000,000 and £367,647,060 and unsecured bridge loans in the amount of $1,285,000,000, and we may borrow up to €813,008,135 under the Secured Bridge Loan Credit Facility. On April 8, 2021, we also increased the total availability under our five year asset based lending credit facility from $750.0 million to $1,000.0 million and expect to further increase such facility to $1,500.0 million (such further increase, the “ABL Credit Facility Increase” and such facility as further amended by the ABL Credit Facility Increase, the “ABL Credit Facility”). However, there can be no assurance that such increase will be consummated, and this offering of the notes is not conditioned upon the completion of the ABL Credit Facility Increase. The amounts borrowed under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Bridge Credit Facilities, together with cash on hand and certain equity contributions, were used to (i) pay the acquisition consideration in connection with the G4S Acquisition and (ii) pay related fees, costs, premiums and expenses in connection therewith. Such net proceeds will also be used for the voluntary or mandatory repayment, redemption, defeasance, tender or acquisition by Allied Universal in full of certain existing third party indebtedness of G4S (the “Existing G4S Debt” and such repayment, redemption, defeasance, tender or acquisition, the “G4S Refinancing”). See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” for a description of the Existing G4S Debt. We expect approximately $2,746 million of the Existing G4S Debt will remain outstanding on the issue date of the notes offered hereby, with all such indebtedness expected to be repaid within approximately 150 days following the issue date of the notes offered hereby. However, certain of the Existing G4S Debt may not be capable of voluntary prepayment on its terms, except in connection with certain adverse changes in taxation and as a result such repayment would be subject to the implementation of a tender offer in respect of such Existing G4S Debt and/or certain amendments to the instruments governing such Existing G4S Debt. ----- The proceeds from this offering of the notes will be used to (i) repay in full borrowings outstanding under the Bridge Credit Facilities and terminate all available borrowings thereunder and (ii) pay related fees, costs, premiums and expenses. In this offering circular, we collectively refer to the entry into the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the G4S Refinancing, the ABL Credit Facility Increase, the entry into and the subsequent repayment of the Bridge Credit Facilities and the termination of all available borrowings thereunder using the net proceeds of this offering of the notes, and in each case, the use of proceeds therefrom, as the “Financing Transactions” and the Financing Transactions, together with the related transactions in connection with the G4S Acquisition, the “Transactions.” See “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” for more information.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Specific adjustments for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 include adjustments for transaction, integration and restructuring costs, sponsor and director fees, non-cash equity-based compensation, legal settlements and related fees, certain adjustments related to the implementation of Allied Universal’s accounting standards, loss on disposal of property and equipment, loss on early extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on disposal of businesses, and miscellaneous other non-recurring adjustments, as further adjusted to give effect to start-up costs and lease costs, profitimprovement initiatives, unrealized synergies from certain acquired businesses, management’s estimates of EBITDA from certain acquired businesses generated prior to their acquisition date, management’s estimates of EBITDA from certain businesses acquired in 2021, profits related to disposed businesses, and other nonrecurring adjustments, which are described in further detail below. Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA has been determined based on the combined statements of operations of Allied Universal and G4S for the year ended December 31, 2020 as adjusted as described under ”Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information,” and as further adjusted to reflect certain non-recurring adjustments and unrealized synergies in connection with the Financing Transactions and G4S Acquisition as described in further detail below. We define Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenue as Allied Universal’s historical revenue, as adjusted to give effect to businesses acquired during 2020 and 2021 by Allied Universal, plus G4S’s ----- historical revenue, as adjusted to give effect to revenue from businesses held for sale by G4S, onerous contracts, revenue from businesses disposed of by G4S during 2020 and 2021 and constant currency exchange rate adjustments. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. We present these non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures because we believe they assist management and investors when analyzing our performance by providing meaningful information that facilitates the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. We recognize these measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and IFRS and there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP and non-IFRS financial measures. Some of these limitations are: - other companies may use different methods to calculate similar non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures, and the measures we present may not be directly comparable with the measures presented by these other companies as a result; - such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, on our debts; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; - such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Allied Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA are adjusted to reflect certain acquisitions and certain unrealized acquisition synergies anticipated to be achieved in connection therewith. We present these adjustments as they will be permitted as adjustments to “EBITDA” under the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby, although the non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures included herein may be defined differently than the corresponding terms under such indentures, and to enable investors to understand the covenants that will apply to us, and not as a projection of future results. We will be required to make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, and these cash costs are not reflected in Allied Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we will not fully realize such cost savings within 12 months of the completion of the Financing Transactions and the G4S Acquisition, and may not do so at all. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment as a projection that we will achieve these acquisition synergies. Our ability to realize these acquisition synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—We may not realize the expected benefits, revenue or cost synergies related to recently completed or future acquisitions” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the G4S Acquisition—We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits ----- of the G4S Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the G4S business.” Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP and non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or as superior to, the presentation of results determined in accordance with GAAP or IFRS, as applicable.

Acquisition adjusted EBITDA related to the completed acquisitions were a combined $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. (n) Represents adjustments to include the impact of EBITDA, adjusted for the realization of expected synergies, from acquired businesses in the first quarter of 2021. Acquired businesses includes SecurAmerica, acquired on January 16, 2021, and two other tuck in acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2021. Acquisition adjusted EBITDA related to these completed acquisitions were a combined $55.9 million on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2020. ----- (o) Represents pro forma adjustments to remove EBITDA earned by G4S on the conventional cash business sold to The Brink’s Company in February 2020 and for businesses held for sale during 2020 but for which the sale was not yet final as of December 31, 2020. (p) Reflects other non-recurring adjustments allowed by the Company’s debt covenants for integration costs incurred by administrative and shared service personnel and other miscellaneous non-recurring items, offset by EBITDA for the non-controlling interests in Allied Universal’s janitorial business. (q) For the year ended December 31, 2020, represents expected synergies related to the G4S Acquisition developed during our quality of earnings and due diligence process, which represents approximately $124 million of synergies driven by overlapping functions in North America (including approximately $11 million for facilities expenses, $22 million for field operations headcount, $20 million for sales headcount, $28 million for corporate headcount, $28 million for non-headcount and $14 million for direct labor cost improvements) and approximately $31 million of synergies from global G4S corporate cost, including general and administrative expenses and expenses in functional support areas that support G4S’s status as a public listed company. The synergies represent approximately one-third of addressable cost structure. We expect that approximately 60% of these synergies will be realized within the next 12 months, including all global G4S corporate costs, with the remainder expected to be realized by the end of 2022. To achieve these synergies, we expect to incur one-time costs of approximately $250 million. Our ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the G4S Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the G4S Acquisition—We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the G4S Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the G4S business.” (r) The average exchange rate used for translation of the reconciliation for the G4S portion of the pro forma combined amounts is 1.36 GBP to USD, which reflects the exchange rate related to hedges that were entered into prior of the submission of the Allied Universal’s offer for G4S and results in G4S Adjusted EBITDA of $862.6 million. Utilizing the average exchange rate during 2020 of 1.284 GBP to USD would result in G4S Adjusted EBITDA of $814.4 million. (2) The Company defines pro forma net secured debt as secured debt outstanding (after giving effect to the ABL Credit Facility Increase and excluding approximately $275.0 million of expected outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Credit Facility and approximately $92.0 million of capital leases, in each case as of December 31, 2020) less cash on a pro forma basis for the notes issued hereby. The Company defines pro forma net total debt as total debt outstanding (after giving effect to the ABL Credit Facility Increase and excluding approximately $275.0 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020) less cash on a pro forma basis for the notes issued hereby. Cash on a pro forma basis represents $1,704 million of Pro Forma Combined Cash as determined under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” plus approximately $71 million for short term investments/marketable securities of G4S, less approximately $497 million of overdrafts and liabilities to customers for G4S as of December 31, 2020, $372 million of cash associated with tuck-in acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2021 and $93 million of other transaction costs, net of the impact of foreign currency adjustments.

We define G4S Adjusted EBITDA as profit / (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items and certain cash expenses management considers non-recurring, unusual or otherwise not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and to reflect the full expected effect of cost reduction and profit-enhancing initiatives, acquisitions, disposals and related cost and revenue synergies. Specific adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 include adjustments for transaction and integration costs, director fees, non-cash equity-based compensation, legal settlements and related fees, loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment, loss (gain) on contingent consideration, certain IFRS adjustments, start-up costs, lease costs, management’s estimates of EBITDA related to disposed businesses, constant currency exchange rate adjustments and other nonrecurring adjustments described below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating these non-IFRS measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. We present G4S Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it assists management and investors when analyzing our performance by providing meaningful information that facilitates the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. We recognize G4S Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under IFRS and there are limitations associated with the use of non-IFRS financial measures. Some of these limitations are: - other companies may use different methods to calculate similar non-IFRS measures, and the measures we present may not be directly comparable with the measures presented by these other companies as a result; - such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, on our debts; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; ----- - non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; - such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or as superior to, the presentation of results determined in accordance with IFRS.

We also compete with smaller local and regional companies that may have better knowledge of the local conditions in their regions, are better known locally and are better able to gain customers in their regions. There are relatively low barriers to entry in the industries in which we operate, and we have faced and expect to continue to face additional competition from new entrants.

Difficulties in obtaining such approvals may lead to projects being delayed before procurement has started, during the tender stage or during the period between being appointed as the preferred bidder and execution of final contracts. Delays in awarding public contracts may also arise from challenges to the award of the contracts by competitors. These matters are beyond our control and any resulting delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Our business is susceptible to economic downturns.,13.4.1,,"While we have a diversified customer base across multiple geographies, as well as a network of blue chip accounts, many customers are located in urban centers and major metropolitan areas. As a result, periods of economic downturn can increase our attrition rate among existing customers. In the small business segment, customers were particularly impacted by the economic downturn and sought to reduce their costs or were forced to close their businesses. Small business subscriptions are more directly correlated to economic conditions. A recession or period of economic uncertainty could lead to increases in our attrition rate and could reduce the inflow of new customers purchasing our services and products. In addition, a recession or economic downturn could result in increased defaults or bankruptcies by our customers, reducing the likelihood of collecting accounts receivable from such customers. Periods of economic downturn can also negatively impact our ability to sell new products and services. A decline in outsourcing by clients, a reversal of the trend towards globalization in large corporations, any deterioration of the current economic situation in the market segments in which we operate, or in the global economy as a whole, and major changes in market dynamics, including new technologies, government legislation or customer consolidation could have a negative impact on our revenues and increase our financing costs, circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Our standard customer contract has a one-year term but may be terminated by either our customer or us with 30 days’ advance notice. Many of our larger contracts are multi-year but also allow for cancellation by either party with 30 to 90 days’ advance notice. We serve certain of our customers under month-to-month extensions of these written contracts.

In particular, the services we provide, the customers and facilities we serve, our employees, and our interactions with members of the public result in our facing significant inherent business, economic and reputational risks. The success of our business depends to a large extent on our reputation and our ability to maintain good relationships with our customers. In recent years, both Allied and G4S have been involved in numerous incidents that have resulted in lost business, reductions in revenue, legal and regulatory proceedings, governmental inquiries and investigations, fines and penalties, negative publicity and constraints on both companies’ ability to raise capital. Given the nature of our ongoing business, there can be no assurances that similar or more significant events will not happen in the future. The following are among such incidents in recent years: In 2019, Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund banned all financial holdings in G4S on the basis that the group contributes to or is responsible for serious or systematic human rights violations, noting that G4S takes custody of employment passports in certain geographies and certain employees had to take large loans to pay employment referral fees. In 2019, G4S lost its contract to run Birmingham Prison as a result of operational failures. Among others, the British government alleged that the Birmingham facility had the highest assault rate of any prison in England and ----- Wales. In 2017, BBC’s Panorama program obtained undercover footage of detainees allegedly being abused at Brook House, an immigration center operated by G4S. As a result of G4S’ investigation and the BBC program, 14 of the 21 staff members allegedly involved either resigned or had their employment terminated. There have been (and continue to be) various public inquiries and investigations into these events. G4S did not seek to renew its contracts to run Gatwick’s immigration removal centers, including Brook House, which expired in May 2020. Further, in 2016, BBC’s Panorama program accused G4S staff of allegedly using unnecessary force and inappropriate language with teenage boys at the Medway Secure Training Centre, Rochester. Sixteen people were later arrested, however there were no convictions. G4S held the contract to run the Medway Secure Training Centre, Rochester, from 1998 to 2016, at which point G4S’s contract was not renewed. Claims have been brought on behalf of American service members alleging that G4S, as well as a number of other multinational companies operating in Afghanistan, including U.S. companies, provided support to the Taliban in Afghanistan. The claims have been brought under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act on behalf of American service members and civilians who were killed or injured in Afghanistan. There are approximately 900 plaintiffs as of April 2021. G4S’s motion to dismiss is currently pending and potential monetary damages, if any, are not yet known. G4S’s executives, managers and guards are alleged to have failed to secure weapons owned by G4S despite warnings that its missing weapons have been used in crimes. We believe that more than 600 G4S weapons have been reported lost or stolen since 2009. In 2016, a G4S employee who had passed G4S background checks despite being placed on a terror watch list committed a nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people and injured another 53. Although the employee was off-duty and used his own weapon, the incident resulted in negative publicity. Florida’s Fourth District Court of Appeal upheld a 2018 trial court’s dismissal of a negligence lawsuit against G4S brought by survivors of relatives of the deceased. In 2013, the UK Serious Fraud Office (“SFO”) commenced a criminal investigation of G4S Care and Justice Services Limited (“G4S C&J”) based on allegations that it had been overcharging and providing fraudulent invoices and financial reporting to the Ministry of Justice for services related to electronic monitoring. In 2014, G4S C&J reported to the SFO that it had failed to provide accurate financial reports to the Ministry of Justice and later settled with the Ministry of Justice. The SFO then charged G4S C&J with three past offenses of fraud. In July 2020, G4S C&J entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the SFO, which is set to conclude in July 2023 and G4S plc made a binding undertaking to ensure compliance. In 2019, shareholders brought a class action claim seeking damages for alleged losses following G4S’s share price decline in 2013 as a result of omitting information about wrongful billing practices with respect to G4S’s contract with the UK government. Although G4S won a motion to strike 90% of the claimants from the case on procedural grounds, the judge is allowing these institutional investors to challenge his decision to bar most of them from suing G4S. The Belgian Competition Authority (BCA) and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) are conducting investigations into G4S’s Belgian business and allegations of price fixing with respect to government contracts. These investigations are ongoing. G4S is subject to a number of claims in India, mainly related to periods prior to 2011, regarding payments to the India Provident Fund (India’s retirement plan that is regulated on a state-by-state basis). The issue is whether G4S was correct to make payments based on basic wages, excluding other parts of the salary (such as bonuses), prior to 2011. In 2013, video footage from the Mangaung Correctional Centre showed alleged mistreatment of South African prisoners by G4S employees providing services there. G4S denied the allegations. In December 2013, South African government officials took over the maximum-security facility after G4S allegedly failed to effectively control the facility. Within ten months, G4S regained responsibility for servicing the prison from the government. In 2015, a group of South African prisoners sued G4S with respect to alleged mistreatment. G4S took over a contract with Israeli prisons in the West Bank after buying a competitor in 2002. International investors divested stakes in G4S amid accusations by international NGOs that G4S was complicit in war crimes. In 2015, G4S allowed certain Israeli contracts to expire. ----- Between October 2012 and March 2014, G4S Australia Pty. Ltd. operated the Manus Island Regional Centre in Papua, New Guinea, which was used to hold immigrants awaiting deportation. There were press reports of alleged human rights issues at such facility and a complaint by an international development organization, litigation brought by former employees and a class action brought by detainees relating to conditions at such facility. In March 2014, G4S Australia’s contract expired and it ceased its operation of the center and subsequently claims related to this matter were settled. Allied and G4S have taken significant steps to mitigate the consequences of all the above incidents. However, as set out above and in “Business—Legal Proceedings,” a number of these incidents are still subject to ongoing review, investigation and litigation. We can also make no assurances that similar, or more significant, incidents will not happen in the future. Such events in the past or future could result in negative publicity relating to the quality of our services or our brand, including as a result of a security incident or breach at one or more of our customers’ locations or shortfalls in our customer service. Such events could also result in damage to our reputation and the loss of existing or new customers legal proceedings, claims and governmental inquiries and investigations. Such incidents can accordingly have a negative effect on our revenues, exposure to significant litigation and regulatory risk, and result in overall reputational harm, all of which individually or in the aggregate can have and, in the past, had significant consequences for our business that could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

We are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs. Price increases are also associated with expenses, in particular, labor costs. As a result, our operating costs may increase faster than our associated revenues, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Minimum wage legislation, complex labor legislation, shortages of qualified workers, termination benefits, payroll, payroll taxes and employee related benefits may also affect our ability to control labor costs. Specifically, we believe that we have higher wages and related payroll taxes and benefits costs than other participants in our industry due to our focus on attracting and retaining a highly qualified workforce. Furthermore, our payroll tax expenses historically are higher in the first half of the year because a significant number of employees do not reach their taxable wage limits for employer related federal and state unemployment taxes until the second half of the year. In the event that we experience a significant or material increase in labor costs and are not able to pass some or all of those costs on to our customers due to fixed hourly bill rates or fixed fee contracts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such fixed price contracts are primarily related to some of our government contracts. Because our business is labor intensive, we rely on being able to attract and retain high quality employees within all of the geographic regions and service areas in which we operate. On a combined basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we employ approximately 740,000 security professionals. Labor is a key component of the daily operation and continued growth of our business. While we believe that we have lower employee turnover than many of our competitors, turnover of contract security officers and administrative staff is significant in our industry, including at our Company. Any difficulties in attracting, training and retaining qualified personnel, including successors for departing personnel, may have an adverse impact on our results. A significant portion of our employees work under collective bargaining agreements. These existing collective bargaining agreements may not be able to be extended or renewed on their current terms, and we may be unable to negotiate collective bargaining agreements in a favorable and timely manner. We may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future or our non-unionized workers may unionize, any of which may could have a material adverse effect on our costs, operations and business. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

However, the loss or departure of members of our management team or other key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we may not be able to attract and retain individuals with the same or similar levels of experience or expertise. Additionally, screening and vetting of qualified personnel is a challenge in some territories, which lack supporting infrastructure from the relevant authorities. Factors, such as minimum levels of training and/or licenses for employees in certain positions in various countries and increasing levels of regulation, may limit our ability to recruit new employees and replace leaving employees effectively, thereby limiting our ability to expand our business. Any incident where our people fail to meet the expectations of our customers and other stakeholders, including the effective sourcing, supervising, training and screening of staff, or nonadherence by employees and contractors to our culture and values as designed and expected, could lead to significant reputational harm and material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Relevant regulation for our operations and employees includes such matters as consumer protection, wage and hour rules (or “labor laws”), fair trade, jurisdiction-specific security industry regulation (including with respect to hardware requirements or operational requirements), data privacy, marketing and competition law. Additionally, most states in the United States have laws, or legislation pending, requiring qualification, training and registration of security officers, regulating the use of identification cards, badges and uniforms and imposing minimum bond surety or insurance standards. In order to install a security system, we generally must be licensed in the jurisdiction where we are installing the system. Additionally, we generally must obtain operating certificates or permits for our security systems, and provide specified levels of training to our employees at those centers. We are also governed by regulations relating to when we can forward alarms to emergency providers, and are subject to certain consequences if we forward false alarms to such emergency providers. Any failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations (local or otherwise) in which we operate may result in fines, penalties or a suspension or termination of our right to provide our security services in the relevant jurisdiction. Additionally, changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could cause us to incur significant costs and expenses to comply with such laws or regulations, or become unable to operate in the security market segment within the localities in which such laws or regulations are implemented, or could impact our sales channels. Such changes may also result in delays in commencement or completion of services for our customers or the need to modify completed installations. Any limitation on our ability to operate our business due to legal or regulatory reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to economic and trade sanctions and bribery and corruption, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our failure to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations may expose us to reputational harm as well as significant penalties, including criminal fines, imprisonment, civil fines, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and debarment from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures.

The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury, the SEC, and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the FCPA, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the OFAC. In addition, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, or the Bribery Act, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. An organization that fails to prevent bribery by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other applicable anti-corruption laws, anti-money laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties and other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results, prospects, and financial condition.

Under the laws of many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be held liable for the negligent acts or misconduct of our agents or employees performed while on duty and in the course and scope of their employment. In many cases, our security service contracts also require us to indemnify our clients or may otherwise subject us to additional liability for events occurring on client premises. In addition, the laws of many states in the United States make us responsible for the conduct of our agents and employees. We carry insurance of various types, including claims, general liability, personal injury, death and property damage, and professional liability insurance, in amounts management considers adequate for our industry. The majority of companies in which we have management control are covered by our general liability insurance program, which provides coverage in respect of legal liability for personal injury and loss or damage to third party property, and Cash in Transit insurance program, which provides coverage in respect of cash, securities, bullion and precious stones or jewelry. We also maintain self-insured retentions using captive insurance subsidiaries in order to take advantage of the pooling of risk to obtain optimum coverage and terms as a group, while ensuring that each individual company’s potential liability is proportionate to the reward afforded by its contracts. Some of our insurance policies, and the laws of some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, may limit or prohibit insurance coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages, or liability arising from willful or grossly negligent conduct. In the United States, the SAFETY Act (The Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002) designation has been renewed for G4S Secure Solutions Inc. from July 22, 2016. We and our customers are protected against certain claims for damages being awarded as a result of declared acts of terrorism. No assurance can be given in relation to the scope and extent of such protection. We also hold claims reserves with wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey and the United States which underwrite part of our cash solutions, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability policies. The exposure of each captive is capped on an annual aggregate basis per risk and reinsured back to insurers. As such, our insurance policies may be inadequate to protect us against liability from the hazards and risks, including potential claims or damages, related to our business. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at rates we consider reasonable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance, or an event that we did not carry adequate insurance for, could result in substantial losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, we experience a significant volume of claims and litigation asserting that we are liable for damages as a result of the conduct of our employees or others. For example, G4S is facing a claim under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act on behalf of American service members and civilians who were killed or injured in Afghanistan, alleging that G4S provided support to the Taliban in Afghanistan. We may from time to time be subject to claims that our officers have harmed individuals in the course of providing these services, or members of the public may be otherwise injured by events occurring on client premises, including events that are not under the immediate control of our security officers, such as terrorist attacks. Many of our employees carry weapons, which involves risk of damage to people and property. Even though we train our employees to use weapons safely, there is a risk that they will not follow proper procedures (either negligently or intentionally), or that safety procedures turn out to be inadequate in particular instances. If so, we may face civil and potentially criminal liability. Liabilities as a result of such claims or events, including terrorist attacks, may not be covered by insurance. Furthermore, from time to time individuals bring personal injury lawsuits against us, in some cases seeking substantial damages based on alleged negligence or other theories of liability relating to our provision of security services, including with respect to injuries not directly caused by, or within the control of, our security officers or our response centers. Under principles of common law, we generally can be held liable for wrongful acts or omissions to act of our agents or employees during the course, and within the scope, of their agency or employment with us.

As of the date of this offering circular, we have nine letters of intent pending, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $509 million. The letters of intent are subject to customary conditions, including due diligence investigations, that may not be satisfied, and any such acquisition is subject to entry into definitive documentation with respect thereto. We cannot predict the timing of any contemplated acquisition and any such transaction may be entered into shortly after closing of the offering of the notes. We will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities, obtain financing on acceptable terms, obtain approval from regulatory authorities for such acquisitions or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates. In addition, to the extent that consolidation becomes more prevalent in our industry, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels, thereby limiting our ability to grow. Our growth through selective acquisitions may place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the diversion of our management’s attention from other business concerns, the possibility that current operating and financial systems and controls may be inadequate to deal with our growth, capital expenditures and accounting charges related to the acquisition and integration and the potential loss of key employees.

Our joint venture partners may (i) have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; (ii) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the relevant joint venture or other agreements; or (iii) experience financial or other difficulties. In some instances, joint venture participants or contractual counterparties may be primarily responsible for recruitment and screening. Further, we may not be able to control the decision-making process of the joint ventures without reference to the joint venture partners and, in some cases, we do not have, or may not have, a majority control of the joint venture.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.17,Organized labor action or occupational health and safety laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.,13.17.1,,"As of the date of this offering circular, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, approximately 26% of our employees were unionized. Although we believe that our relationships with our employees are good, organized labor action at one or more of our facilities may occur, and any such activities, or any other labor difficulties at our facilities or the facilities of any of our customers, could materially affect us. In addition, we are subject to, among other laws and regulations, comprehensive occupational health and safety laws and regulations and wage and hour laws, as applicable, in the various countries in which we operate. Such laws and regulations may become more stringent and result in necessary modifications to our current practices and facilities that could force us to incur additional costs that could materially affect us. Furthermore, any breach of occupational health and safety laws and regulations could disrupt our business and have a negative impact on our reputation, leading to financial and regulatory costs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.18,Our business is at risk of criminal acts.,13.18.1,,"Our business is subject to the threat of criminal acts of various types, such as robbery, attempted robbery and theft, for example in connection with guarding and storing of valuable property, and also destruction and damage to property, significant injury or loss of life of our employees, including as a result of terrorist attacks, armed attacks, road safety, accidents on customer sites and mishandling or mismanagement of firearms. If the proportion of assets and facilities stored or guarded by us that are lost or otherwise damaged through criminal acts increases or the amount of incidents that occur while we are performing our services increases, the costs of our insurance may increase, and it may also have a negative effect on our customers’ confidence in us. Particular criminal acts could result in us becoming liable for compensation and costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Certain criminal threats, such as the threat of terrorist attacks, could also result in us incurring additional personnel and other costs as a result of the need for enhanced security measures and compliance with expanded security rules and regulations. Furthermore, the products and services we sell to customers, and our servers and data centers on which our data, and data of our customers, suppliers and business partners are stored, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data protection breaches, malware, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering, despite our implementation of network security measures. Our servers have in the past been subject to cyber-attacks. Any such event could compromise the operations of our security services, our networks or those of our customers, and the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation. Efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of our own security services efforts may be costly to implement and met with resistance, and may not be successful. Due to the type of services provided by us, we also face the risk of encountering losses due to employees committing criminal acts. For example, our security business faces the risk of security guards attending alarm responses committing theft at the customers’ premises. These factors may affect margins and profitability and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.19,Any significant or prolonged disruption of our operations could constrain our ability to effectively serve our customers.,13.19.1,,"A disruption to our operations, including as a result of human error, inadequate internal or external processes or systems, natural and other catastrophes, technological failure, external events and acts of third parties, could constrain our ability to provide security services and fulfill our obligations to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are exposed to various risks, such as outages and interruptions in the connections between our alarms and our monitoring centers and larger-scale power failures or other catastrophes. We are dependent on our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure. Telephone or other IT infrastructure failure, incomplete backup routines, inadequate business continuity and disaster recovery plans, cyber security or other external security breaches, viruses and other disruptive events could halt or delay out ability to service our customers, ----- hinder our ability to conduct and expand our business, result in censures and fines by national governments in countries in which we operate and result in significant remediation costs. Such disruptions could also cause loss of confidence in our brand and loss of trust by our customers, especially those in government and financial sectors. In addition, given the nature of our business, we continuously evaluate and implement upgrades to our IT infrastructure, as well as develop new technology platforms to support new initiatives and product and service offerings. There are inherent risks with upgrading such systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. While we believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate these risks through testing, training and staging implementation, we may not be able to successfully launch these systems as planned or the systems may be implemented with disruptions to our operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

If we experience a breach of our data security, such private information may be at risk of exposure. To the extent that any such exposure leads to credit card fraud or identity theft, or the misuse or distribution of other data, including images taken by our photo detectors and cameras, we may experience a general decline in customer confidence in our business, which may lead to an increase in our attrition rate or make it more difficult to attract new customers. If we are unable to identify potential threats prior to a breach of our systems, customers may lose confidence in our ability to protect their information. If customers become reluctant to use our services because of concerns over data privacy, our ability to generate revenues would be impaired. In addition, if technology upgrades or other expenditures are required to prevent security breaches of our network, boost general customer confidence in our business, or prevent credit card fraud and identity theft, we may be required to make unplanned capital expenditures or expend other resources. Any disruptions to our information technology system, breaches or compromises of data or associated loss of confidence in our business or additional capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.21,We may not be able to adequately protect our technologies or adequately enforce our intellectual property rights; unauthorized use of or disputes involving our proprietary technology and processes may adversely affect our business.,13.21.1,,"Our success and competitive position depends in part on a combination of trade secrets and proprietary knowhow, as well as protection of our brands and trademarks. We use our in-house development team to design proprietary products, including hardware and software protocols. We also cooperate with our network of manufacturing partners to jointly develop new proprietary products and solutions. We have sought and received few patents covering such proprietary technologies and therefore the legal protections covering our proprietary technologies from infringement or other misuse may be inadequate. While we seek to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technologies and trade secrets, through various methods such as entering into non-disclosure agreements with employees and third parties and controlling access to our proprietary information, third parties nevertheless may try to copy or reverse engineer portions our products, circumvent our security methods or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. The remedy for any breach of such protections may not be adequate to compensate us for the damages suffered. Further, our competitors may independently develop competing technologies that are similar to our technologies without misappropriating or infringing our intellectual property. Any access to or use by competitors of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to claims of patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights infringement by third parties. In developing technologies and systems, we may not adequately identify third party intellectual property rights or assess the scope and validity of these third party rights. Accordingly, we may become subject to lawsuits alleging that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others and seeking that we cease to use the relevant technology. Intellectual property litigation could adversely affect the development or sale of the challenged product or technology, require us to re-brand our products and offerings, or require us to pay damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any such intellectual property litigation could represent a significant expense and divert ----- our personnel’s attention and efforts and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

For example, we face a number of wage and hour claims brought by former and current employees and governmental agencies. We could become involved in legal disputes in the future that may involve substantial claims for damages or other payments. These disputes may also divert management’s attention from the running of the business and could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the company. In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a settlement agreement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, such outcomes could result in the withdrawal or non-renewal of licenses, permits and/or permissions to operate or other penalties, fines or sanctions, and they could affect our relations with current and potential customers and have an adverse impact on our reputation. In addition, the costs related to litigation proceedings may be significant. Even in case of a positive outcome in such proceedings, we may still have to bear part or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursed by the opponent, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax audits. Any tax assessments, penalties, and interest, or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations. During 2020, G4S Care and Justice Services (UK) Limited entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the Serious Fraud Office (“SFO”) in the United Kingdom, in respect of the UK Care & Justice electronic monitoring contract investigation which commenced in 2013. As part of the DPA, G4S agreed to pay an aggregate amount of over £44 million. The DPA spans a period of three years, ending in July 2023, and requires G4S to take a number of actions focused on strengthening the Care & Justice internal control environment. Failure to fulfil G4S’s commitments as set out in the DPA could lead to the SFO seeking to prosecute the Care & Justice business. The SFO is also conducting a criminal investigation into individual employees of G4S in relation to the above-described conduct, in which three individuals were charged with seven offences of fraud. In 2019, a number of shareholders of G4S brought a claim seeking damages for alleged losses following the reduction in G4S’s share price in 2013, as a result of omitting information about the wrongful billing practices in respect of the G4S’s contract with the United Kingdom government which is also subject to the DPA. In April 2020, G4S received requests for information from the Belgian Competition Authority (“BCA”) and the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (“DoJ”) in connection with G4S’ Belgian business. The BCA and the DoJ inquiries are ongoing and G4S is engaging and cooperating fully with both authorities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, G4S recognized a charge of £43 million in respect of these inquiries after taking into account estimates of the potential financial penalties which might arise on completion of the inquiry process ranging from £25 million to £50 million in the aggregate. There is a wide range of possible outcomes in respect of these inquiries, including the potential imposition of material financial penalties, third-party claims and/or debarment from certain tendering processes, which may lead to a potential financial impact materially outside the currently estimated range of financial penalties. G4S is also subject to various claims in the United States, including class action litigation accusing G4S of performing employment-related background checks without fully complying with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act on behalf of American service members and civilians who were killed or injured in Afghanistan, alleging that G4S provided support to the Taliban in Afghanistan. In January 2019, G4S also agreed to settle a class action relating to claims for employee meal and rest breaks in California for a final payment of $110 million. G4S is currently involved in a number of claims in India, mainly related to periods prior to 2011, in relation to the interpretation of the basis for payments to the India Provident Fund. These disputes are currently awaiting court resolution. G4S believes it has a strong legal position in defending against such claims, which amount to approximately £50 million. While we cannot predict with any certainty the potential outcomes in respect of these proceedings, such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.23,We rely on third party suppliers for certain parts of our security systems and any failure or interruption in the provision of such products or failure by us to meet minimum purchase requirements could harm our ability to operate our business.,13.23.1,,"The security systems and other products that we install are manufactured by third party suppliers. Our suppliers’ abilities to meet our needs are subject to various risks, including political and economic stability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor issues. We are therefore susceptible to the interruption of supply or the receipt of faulty products from our suppliers. For example, if suppliers for key components fail to deliver products or experience delays in delivery, such difficulties may prevent us from upgrading equipment, delivering products to our customer on time, or otherwise hinder our ability to install and upgrade systems and provide replacement parts. This could result in higher costs to us and a potential decline in confidence in our products and services among our customers. We use these partnerships to supplement our own internal product development team. If these suppliers fail to keep pace with technological innovations, we may incur increased product development costs or lose customers to competitors with access to these technological innovations. Any interruption in supply, failure to produce quality products or inability to keep pace with technological innovation by a supplier could adversely affect our operations, as it may be difficult for us to find alternatives on terms acceptable to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Our profitability also depends on our ability to mobilize contracts effectively following awarding of a contract and to transition from mobilization to on-going contract management. Many service contracts we enter into, particularly those under which we provide more comprehensive services and receive greater revenue, are complex, high-value contracts with multinational companies, governments or strategic partners and are longer term commitments than our other contracts, which may result in us accepting onerous contractual terms, may create on-going contract management issues, may result in inaccurate billing and may result in ineffective management of subcontractors, and bidding for them requires us to make judgments on likely future economics. Likewise, although contracts lasting several years generally include clauses that allow for price adjustments due to inflation and other factors (such as increases in labor costs) we face the risk of not being able to increase prices enough in order to fully compensate higher future costs, such as wages. Most of the sectors in which we operate are price competitive, which can result in relatively thin margins under certain contracts, where even small increases in costs or changes in scope relative to the assumptions in a bid may materially impact the profitability of the relevant contract. While we have recorded provisions in respect of certain contracts (some of which may be able to be extended by the counterparty), no assurance can be given that such provisions will be sufficient to cover the losses ultimately incurred under such contracts, that further provisions for such contracts will not be required in the future (particularly in the event that any such contracts are extended by the customer), or that the costs of fulfilling other contracts will not exceed the actual or expected economic benefit under such contracts resulting in further provisions for losses with respect to certain contracts. If additional provisions and/or increased costs need to be recognized in the future, this may result in lower returns, and economic, reputational and other impacts associated with onerous contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Our international operations, which represented approximately 33% of our pro forma combined revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, subject us to complex and frequently changing laws and regulations, including differing labor laws and regulations relating to the protection of certain information that we ----- collect and maintain about our employees, clients and other third parties. Among these laws is the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which took effect in May 2018. Increasing regulatory scrutiny in relation to data protection may impose additional compliance obligations and may also limit the extent to which customer data can be used to achieve our strategic objectives. Such new or changing regulations may require modification of our processes and staff training and result increased costs. The failure to comply with these laws or regulations could subject us to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, or fines in one or more jurisdictions. More generally, the economic, political, monetary, and operational impacts of Brexit, including unanticipated impacts to the U.K. real estate market and general economic conditions in the United Kingdom, could negatively impact our U.K. business, including reducing our margins. These impacts remain highly uncertain, in particular, in respect of the U.K’s future access to the European Union’s single market, its future regulatory environment and the free movement of capital and labor. This market volatility may lead to an increase in our cost of borrowing and/or restrictions on the availability of credit which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, the operating results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, and those results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. There can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Further, as of the date of this offering circular, we operate in over 90 countries and have more than 550 legal entities, with a significant number of local financial systems and processes. This can lead to an inherently diverse set of processes and controls that rely on local capabilities for implementation and execution of controls. Due to geographical span and decentralized structure of some of our international operations, coupled with the current disparate systems landscape and evolving implementation and control environment, there can be no assurance that the systems and controls in place will be effective in preventing or detecting any errors. If any errors are not prevented or remain undetected, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Allied Universal and the G4S UK Pension Trustee have also agreed on matters relating to the potential impact of the Offer and certain possible future disposals on the G4S UK Pension Scheme. In addition, calculating pensions requires our management to make assumptions in relation to various factors, such as expected returns on plan assets and longevity of scheme members.

We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the G4S business.,13.29.1,,"Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the G4S Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully integrate the G4S business. The integration of a business is a complex, costly and timeconsuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with the business practices and operations of G4S. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the acquired business and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could adversely impact the carrying value of the acquisition premium or goodwill, could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our business activities, and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the overall integration of G4S may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, loss of customers and diversion of the attention of our management and employees. The challenges of integrating the operations of acquired businesses include, among others: - difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the acquisition; - difficulties in the integration of operations and systems, including information technology systems; - difficulties in establishing effective uniform controls, standards, systems, procedures, business cultures, compensation structures and accounting and other policies between the two businesses; - difficulties in the acculturation of employees; - difficulties managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company with a global presence; - difficulties in overseeing and ensuring compliance with complex and frequently changing laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions; - challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; - challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel, including personnel that are considered key to the future success of the business; and ----- - challenges in keeping key business relationships in place. Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs and liabilities, decreases in the amount of expected revenue and earnings, and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, even if the operations of our business and G4S are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the G4S Acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or cash flows that are expected, and we will also be subject to additional risks that could impact future earnings. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of G4S. In addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customer and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the G4S Acquisition. These integration matters and our significant amount of indebtedness may hinder our ability to make further acquisitions and could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period after the G4S Acquisition.

Likewise, we cannot assure you that the collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation.

We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when and if required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets.

In addition, our business requires compliance with numerous U.S. federal, state, provincial and local license and permit requirements, as well as, after giving effect to the Transactions, foreign license and permit requirements. Continued operation of our properties that are part of the collateral will depend on the continued compliance with such license and permit requirements to the extent applicable, and our business and the value of the collateral may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with these requirements or changes in these requirements.

To the extent the ABL Collateral is released from securing the obligations secured by the ABL Collateral on a first-priority basis, including all obligations under the ABL Credit Facility, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in certain circumstances (including in connection with the exercise of remedies by the ABL Agent or in connection with a sale or other disposition of the ABL Collateral permitted under the terms of the ABL Credit Facility and the secured indenture that will govern the secured notes offered hereby), the second-priority liens securing the secured notes offered hereby in the Notes Collateral will automatically also be released. In addition, the secured indenture that will govern the secured notes offered hereby and the security documents related to the holders of such notes’ second-priority lien on the ABL Collateral may not be amended in any manner that is prohibited by or inconsistent with the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the ABL Agent and each other collateral agent party to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that has a permitted firstpriority lien on the ABL Collateral until such first-priority lien obligations are paid in full. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement further provides that, under certain circumstances, the holders of the secured notes offered hereby would be required to turn over to the holders of obligations under the ABL Credit Facility amounts they receive from the issuers with respect to the ABL Collateral. We cannot assure you that in the event of a foreclosure by the holders of the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility or a bankruptcy event, the proceeds from the sale of ABL Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy all or any of the amounts outstanding under the secured notes offered hereby after payment in full of the obligations secured by such first-priority liens on the ABL Collateral, including all obligations under the ABL Credit Facility. See “Description of Secured Notes—Security.” In addition, in the event of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, if the lenders under the ABL Credit Facility desire to permit any use of cash collateral consisting of ABL Collateral or debtor-in-possession (“DIP”) financing that is secured at least in part by the ABL Collateral, the holders of the secured notes offered hereby would (assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place with respect to their liens on the Notes Collateral in connection with such use of cash collateral or DIP financing) be limited in raising objections to such use of cash collateral or DIP financing. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement also limits the right of the holders of the secured notes offered hereby to raise various other objections or take various other actions in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the ABL Collateral prior to the payment in full of the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility, including, among other things, seeking relief from the “automatic stay” with respect to the ABL Collateral, and also places certain restrictions on their right to seek “adequate protection” of their interests in the ABL Collateral from a bankruptcy court, even though such holders’ rights with respect to such collateral were being affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the ----- lien securing the secured notes offered hereby and the guarantees on such collateral will be automatically released and discharged. If the issuers issue additional indebtedness that is senior to or equal in priority to the lien securing the secured notes offered hereby in the future in a greater principal amount than the secured notes offered hereby, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the collateral agent. Accordingly, the collateral agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the collateral. In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the secured notes offered hereby on such collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first-priority obligations with respect to any non-ABL Collateral and, with respect to the ABL Collateral, applied first to the secured parties under the ABL Credit Facility and second, ratably among all of the then outstanding second-priority obligations (including the secured notes offered hereby, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility, the Existing Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities)). The collateral so released will no longer secure the issuers’ and the guarantors’ obligations under the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees. The holders of the secured notes offered hereby will also waive, certain important rights otherwise available to secured creditors in a bankruptcy, as the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement prohibits the Trustee and the collateral agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the secured notes offered hereby would be unable to raise an objection. Also, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the secured notes offered hereby obtain possession of any collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other senior or pari passu obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of such obligations and, subject to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, promptly transfer such collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of such obligations.

The liens on the collateral securing the secured notes offered hereby may not be perfected if we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. We will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the secured notes offered hereby in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements. To the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not properly perfected on the date of the issuance of the secured notes offered hereby, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the collateral. See “—Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.” If additional material wholly-owned domestic, Luxembourg or UK restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the secured indenture that will govern the secured notes offered hereby, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the Secured Trustee nor the collateral agent will be responsible to monitor, and the issuers may not inform the Secured Trustee or the collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral.

While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes offered hereby and the guarantees and, in the case of the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, the grant of liens will generally be a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuances of the notes offered hereby or guarantees or, in the case of the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, the grant of liens were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding other creditors or (ii) the issuers or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes offered hereby or a guarantee or, in the case of the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, the granting of liens and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true: - the issuers or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes offered hereby, the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees); - the issuances of the notes offered hereby or guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees) left the issuers or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business in which such issuer or such guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or - any of the issuer, the co-issuer or the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur indebtedness beyond our or its ability to pay as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuances of the notes offered hereby or a guarantee or, in the case of the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, the grant of liens was a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent ----- transfer, the court could avoid the payment obligations under the notes offered hereby or such guarantee in total or in part or further subordinate the notes offered hereby or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the issuers or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes offered hereby to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes offered hereby or such guarantee or, in the case of the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, avoid the liens to secure the secured notes offered hereby or the related guarantees. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes offered hereby. Further, the avoidance of the notes offered hereby could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the issuers or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the issuers or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes offered hereby (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuances of the notes offered hereby and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the issuers’ or any guarantor’s other indebtedness. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing indebtedness and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent indebtedness is satisfied. A court would likely find that the issuers or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes offered hereby or such guarantee and/or lien if such issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes offered hereby or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the issuers’ benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could avoid the obligations under the guarantees (and any related liens with respect to the secured notes offered hereby), subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other indebtedness or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes offered hereby. To the extent a court avoids (x) any of the guarantees as fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers or holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the notes offered hereby or the related guarantees would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable guarantor or (y) in the case of liens granted to secure the secured notes offered hereby or the related guarantees, the holders of the secured notes offered hereby would cease to have a secured claim against the issuers or the guarantors, as applicable. If a court were to hold a guarantee unenforceable, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee of the notes offered hereby. Sufficient funds to repay the notes offered hereby may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the issuers or the applicable guarantor. Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes offered hereby will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent ----- transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, as noted above, any payment by the issuers pursuant to the notes offered hereby or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time such issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to the issuers or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the issuers’ or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any non-insider party and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party (as the case may be) more than such creditor would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes offered hereby or the guarantees to other claims against the issuers or the guarantors under the principle of “equitable subordination,” if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes offered hereby engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes offered hereby; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

See “Description of Certain Indebtedness—New Senior Secured Credit Facilities—Interest.” EURIBOR and LIBOR are deemed to be “benchmarks” and have been the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU (which, for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed). ----- The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Specifically, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of benchmark reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. The UK Financial Conduct Authority has indicated through a series of announcements that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Separately, the euro risk free rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, LIBOR and EURIBOR will continue to be supported going forward. This may cause LIBOR and EURIBOR to perform differently than in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted., Such factors may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay on borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.57,Rights of holders of the secured notes offered hereby in the collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.,13.57.1,,"The right of the collateral agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against the issuers or the guarantors that provide security for the secured notes offered hereby or the related guarantees prior to, or possibly even after, any collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the collateral agent, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances or which could be delayed). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the secured notes offered hereby could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the collateral agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral, the value of the collateral as of the commencement date of any bankruptcy proceedings or any other date, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the secured notes offered hereby would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of the collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of business would also require approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances or which could be delayed). Also, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the secured notes offered hereby and all of our other outstanding First Lien Obligations (as defined under the headings “Description of Secured Notes”) the holders of the notes offered hereby would be “under-secured.” U.S. bankruptcy laws do not provide for the payment or accrual of interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees on the under-secured, “deficiency” portion of a creditor claims during a debtor’s bankruptcy case nor is a creditor entitled to adequate protection on account of any under-secured portion of its claims. In addition, as noted above, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the Secured Trustee and the collateral agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions.

We may not be able to refinance the notes offered hereby on reasonable terms, if at all. The issuers’ failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes offered hereby or to purchase all validly tendered notes offered hereby would be an event of default under the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes.

Accordingly, if such an asset sale were to occur, the issuers may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase the notes offered hereby and such other indebtedness that the issuers would be required to offer to purchase or that become immediately due and payable as a result. The issuers may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may not be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all.

Under the terms of the Offer, as set out in full in the offer document published by Allied Bidco dated January 5, 2021, G4S shareholders are entitled to receive 245 pence in cash for each G4S share (the G4S Acquisition). The Offer was made to G4S shareholders resident in the United States in reliance on, and compliance with, Section 14(e) of the US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder, as a “Tier II” tender offer (as set forth in Rule 14d-1(d) under the US Exchange Act). On April 13, 2021, Allied Bidco announced that it had received acceptances under the Offer in respect of, or otherwise acquired, not less than 90% in value of the G4S shares to which the Offer relates and of the voting rights carried by those shares, and would therefore exercise its rights in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006 to acquire compulsorily the remaining G4S shares in respect of which the Offer has not been accepted. In addition, Allied Universal, Allied Bidco and the G4S UK Pension Trustee of the G4S UK Pension Scheme entered into a Memorandum of Understanding setting out the parties’ intentions with respect to the future funding of the G4S UK Pension Scheme. Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, in addition to certain support measures, Allied Universal will pay cash contributions to the G4S UK Pension Scheme based on a funding shortfall of approximately £535 million reflecting the higher funding target agreed with the G4S UK Pension Trustee. Allied Universal and the G4S UK Pension Trustee have also agreed on matters relating to the potential impact of the Offer and certain possible future disposals on the G4S UK Pension Scheme. Such commitment to funding per the Memorandum of Understanding is accounted for as a liability assumed in the application of purchase accounting under ASC 805.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, are presented herein. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines the unaudited consolidated balance sheets of Allied Universal and G4S as of December 31, 2020 and gives effect to the G4S Acquisition as if it occurred on December 31, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations combines the historical results of Allied Universal and G4S for the year ended December 31, 2020 and gives effect to the G4S Acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that address differences in reporting currencies, differences in bases of accounting, and differences in the classification and presentation of certain financial information and reflect transaction accounting adjustments, as well as other adjustments deemed to be directly related to the G4S Acquisition, irrespective of whether such adjustment is deemed to be recurring. Any adjustments for differences in bases of accounting are determined after taking into effect the impacts of purchase accounting. Allied Universal is deemed to be the accounting acquirer and the pro forma adjustments are preliminary and are based on estimates that are subject to change. The combined group will not be a “foreign private issuer” as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act and Rule 3b-4(c) under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the pro forma information of the combined group is prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations was prepared using the historical audited consolidated statement of operations of Allied Universal for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the historical audited consolidated income statement of G4S for the year ended December 31, 2020. Allied Universal’s historical audited financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and presented in thousands of U.S. dollars.

For this purpose, fair value shall be determined in accordance with the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, “Fair _Value Measurements and Disclosures,” (“ASC 820”). Fair value is defined in ASC 820 as “the price that would be_ received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” Fair value measurements can be highly subjective and can involve a high degree of estimation. In the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet, the purchase price paid by Allied Universal to acquire G4S has been allocated to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill based upon management’s preliminary estimate of respective fair values as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information includes a preliminary allocation of the purchase price based on assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable under the circumstances, are subject to changes, which may be material. Allied Universal has not completed a full, detailed valuation analysis necessary to determine the fair values of G4S’s identifiable assets to be acquired, liabilities to be assumed and noncontrolling interest. The preliminary calculation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed performed for the purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements was primarily limited to the identification and calculation of preliminary values for the intangible assets and deferred taxes. The calculations necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been performed based on proprietary benchmarking information, publicly available information, as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market participant assumptions. Where practicable, the benchmark information was corroborated with an income approach methodology. Allied Universal ----- will continue to refine its identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as further information becomes available. Refer to Note 6E for the range of fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final determination of the purchase price allocation is anticipated to be completed as soon as practicable and will be based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition closing date. The final amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed could differ significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Such final allocation could result in significantly different amortization and depreciation expense due to differing allocations of purchase price between definite versus indefinite lived intangible assets, or depreciating tangible assets. The purchase price is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the midpoint of their respective estimated fair values, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill as follows (in USD thousands): Cash consideration .................................................................................................. **$** **5,324,451 Cash and Cash Equivalents ..................................................................................... 2,049,716 Accounts receivable, net ......................................................................................... 1,197,734 Other assets acquired ............................................................................................... 1,848,298 Identifiable intangible assets acquired .................................................................... 2,484,901",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The Offer was made to G4S shareholders resident in the United States in reliance on, and compliance with, Section 14(e) of the US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder, as a “Tier II” tender offer (as set forth in Rule 14d-1(d) under the US Exchange Act).

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of the acquisition. For each of the periods presented, the pro forma financial information reflects the combination of historical financial information of Allied Universal and G4S, adjusted to give effect to the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 based on a preliminary purchase price allocation, and as subsequently described in greater detail. Furthermore, additional pro forma adjustments have also been reflected to show impacts of financing to effect the acquisition, addresses differences in reporting currencies, differences in bases of accounting, and differences in the classification and presentation of certain financial information, and shows the effects of the adoption of certain accounting standards. For purposes of certain disclosures that follow, Allied Universal and G4S may be referred to collectively as the “Combined Company.” The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, are presented herein.

The pro forma adjustments included in this document are subject to modification based on the final determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, additional analysis, and additional information that may become available, which may cause the final adjustments to be materially different from the pro forma condensed combined financial statements presented below. Following the consummation of the G4S Acquisition, Allied Universal management will perform a detailed review of G4S’s accounting policies in an effort to determine if differences in accounting policies require further reclassification of G4S’s results of operations or reclassification of assets or liabilities to conform to Allied Universal’s accounting policies and classification. As a result, Allied Universal may subsequently identify additional material differences in the accounting policies which could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma combined financial information.

Allied Universal was formed in August 2016 through the combination of AlliedBarton and Universal, which brought together two of the leading providers in the security services industry. AlliedBarton, founded in 1957, and Universal, founded in 1965, were leaders in the industry in customer service, organic growth, customer and employee retention, accretive M&A, and had a highly complementary and diverse set of blue chip customers. The combined company became the largest provider of security officer services in North America and has continued to grow since, both organically and through M&A.

Since 2007, the company has successfully executed 72 acquisitions, including small and large tuck-ins. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Allied announced the acquisition of SOS Security, which brought a complementary approach and further scale to Allied Universal. As of 2020, Allied Universal has an estimated 31% share of the highly fragmented outsourced manned guarding security services market in the United States, with a track record of growth driven both organically and through acquisitions. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Characteristics of Allied Universal’s Revenues and Expenses Revenues,17.3.1,,"We generate revenues primarily from customer contracts obligating us to provide security officer services at agreed-upon hourly billing rates. Our standard customer contract has a one-year term but may be terminated by either our customer or us with 30 days’ advance notice. Many of our larger contracts are multi-year but also allow for cancellation by either party with 30 to 90 days’ advance notice. We base our customer billings on the underlying contractual terms, which generally include a mark-up on wages paid or a stated bill rate for hours worked. The majority of our customers are billed a rate per hour worked which includes wages and benefits. We generally bill our customers either in advance, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. Our revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2020 over the corresponding period was driven by acquisitions, as well as organic revenue growth related to bill-rate improvements. Our organic revenue growth is driven primarily by our ability to maintain strong customer retention rates and to attract new customers. Our contract security officer revenues and high retention rates are dependent on our ability to attract and retain high-quality, qualified employees. Our wage rates are generally above market averages, and we provide our security officers with benefits at a higher level than many of our competitors. In addition, we engage in extensive candidate screening, training and development, which supports employee retention. We believe our employee retention rate compares favorably to the average retention rates in our industry. In turn, this has allowed us to realize higher than average customer bill rates. In addition to our security officer services, we provide security system, janitorial and other ancillary services for our customers. Our security systems solutions include consulting, design and engineering, installation, and event and repair services for security systems. These revenue streams represented approximately 6% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Direct Expenses,17.4.1,,"Direct expenses are comprised primarily of direct labor, payroll taxes, medical and life insurance benefits, workers’ compensation costs, general liability, employment practices liability and automobile insurance costs, and subcontract labor and other direct expenses. We classify all of our security officer wages and our account manager compensation and payroll-related expenses as direct expenses. Compensation paid includes regular pay, overtime pay for hourly personnel, bonus, vacation, training, holiday and sick time. The total hours paid normally exceeds total hours billed principally due to unbillable overtime and certain other unbillable costs. We believe that we have higher wage and benefit costs than other companies in our industry, due to our focus on attracting, developing and retaining a highly qualified workforce. ----- General wage inflation, payroll tax rate and related taxable wage threshold changes, and insurance premiums and related claim costs are the primary drivers that affect the major components of direct expenses. Traditionally, we have been able to pass increased costs in these areas on to our customers. Our payroll tax expenses historically are higher in the first half of the year because a significant number of employees do not reach their taxable wage limits for employer related federal and state unemployment taxes until the second half of the year. Medical benefit costs for the majority of our workforce consist of premium-based insurance costs. Conversely, for administrative employees and security officers not subject to premium-based coverage, we are selfinsured and subject to self-insured retention limits.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Key Factors Affecting Allied Universal’s Performance,17.5.1,,"We believe the following trends and factors have an important impact on our financial performance: - Continued growth in the security market: Due to increased occurrences of adverse safety and security events affecting the general public, continued wage growth, and increased outsourced services penetration, we continue to see growth in the total size of the security market in the United States and globally. As a marketleading provider of security services and technology solutions, overall industry growth is a factor driving our business. As such, our financial results are significantly affected by overall industry growth. - Increasing pressure on customer pricing combined with a competitive labor market: The security market is intensely competitive as there are relatively low barriers to entry. We compete directly with companies that are local, regional, national and international in scope. As more customers select service providers through competitive bid processes intended to procure quality services at lower prices, our customer retention may be affected as new market competitors may be willing to provide services at lower prices and margins. In addition, we face pressure to increase compensation and benefits for employees as we compete with other companies for the same workforce. Our ability to retain customers is dependent on our ability to hire, train and retain employees at scale while efficiently deploying our workforce to efficiently meet our customers’ security service needs. - Our ability to deliver comprehensive, integrated security solutions and expand the use of technology: Increasingly, our clients are asking us for more complex technology solutions and security operations services. As such, we believe that our success will be based on our ability to tailor specific, innovative solutions to meet the changing needs of our clients. - Our sales performance and ability to execute on strategy: The number of clients that we add in a given period impacts our longer-term revenue.

Direct expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 86.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 88.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Acquisition and related costs decreased by $79.3 million, or (75.3)%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower professional expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and obligations assumed is allocated to goodwill. Goodwill typically represents the value paid for the assembled workforce and enhancement of our service offerings. As part of certain completed acquisitions, we may agree to pay cash to the sellers based upon achievement of certain targets after the acquisition date. The fair values of these contingent consideration arrangements are estimated using a probability weighted income approach. We evaluate the fair value of the contingent consideration throughout the year and every reporting period. Changes in the fair value during the measurement period that pertain ----- to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are recorded as measurement period adjustments to goodwill.

We do not require collateral for trade receivables; however, we monitor our customer relationships in order to minimize our credit risk. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a culmination of factors. These factors include: (1) customer creditworthiness, (2) aging of accounts receivable, (3) past transaction history with the customer, (4) current economic industry trends and (5) changes in customer payment terms. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, we would provide additional allowances.

Such events and circumstances include, among other factors: - current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or forecasts indicating continuing losses associated with the use of an asset, - significant decreases in the market value of an asset, - technological developments resulting in obsolescence, - significant changes in demand for our services in competition and competitive practices, or - significant negative changes in the business climate, industry or economic conditions. Recoverability of our long-lived assets is determined based upon the expected undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate, utilizing our best estimates, appropriate assumptions, and projections at the time of review.

For goodwill, which we have determined is a single reporting unit, we may conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In a qualitative assessment, we would consider the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general conditions and industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, increased competition, changes in the products/services and regulatory and political developments, cost of doing business, overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods, other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation, and events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair ----- value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we would perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test as required. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then no further testing is required. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then we would record an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on a combination of significant observable and unobservable inputs, including estimates of future operating performance. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. For our indefinite-lived trade names, we may also conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the trade names is less than their carrying value, we estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names using the relief from royalty method. The relief from royalty method measures the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such intangible assets and not having to pay a royalty for their use. Impairment would then be recognized for the difference between the determined fair value and their carrying value, if applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Medical benefit costs for the majority of our workforce are premium-based. Costs associated with the premium-based plans equal the actual premiums paid and premiums can fluctuate. Conversely, for administrative employees and security officers not subject to premium-based coverage, we are self-insured and subject to self-insured retention limits. We record a reserve if we believe it is probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. We provide a reserve for all known claims and those claims that we believe have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date based on our estimate of the ultimate cost of the claims. Our estimates of the ultimate cost of claims are derived from the level of our insurance coverages, our retained risk of loss, third-party actuarial analyses and management’s judgment. We review these estimates on a quarterly basis subject to information then currently available to assess their adequacy and the propriety of disclosure. We adjust the reserves, if needed, based on the results of our review. Assessing the adequacy of these reserves is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates. In the normal course of operations, various legal claims are filed against the Company for which we maintain insurance coverage. We have reserved for these claims based on insurance coverage, the risk of loss retained by the Company and management’s judgment.

This expense is presented as a separate line item under operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We use an independent valuation advisor to assist with determining the fair value of the equity awards used for calculating equity unit-based compensation. We consider both the historical volatility of our peer group’s stock prices, as well as implied volatilities from exchange-traded options on our peer group’s equity units, as applicable. The expected term used represents the period that the equity units are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity unit-based awards represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions were used, equity unit-based compensation could materially differ in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate as well as achievement of any performance metric specified within the award, and only recognize expense for those units expected to vest.

The legal entities that are treated as partnerships for federal and state income tax purposes pass their taxable income or loss through to the members who report their share of the income or loss which has been allocated to them under the respective membership agreements. The membership agreements have provisions requiring the distribution of funds to the members in amounts sufficient for the members to satisfy their federal, state, and local tax obligations with respect to their share of our income, subject to board approval. The legal entities that are treated as C-corporations calculate an income tax provision or benefit for the current income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of differences between the accounting and tax treatment of items related to these entities. Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of a recorded deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount sufficient to reduce that deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We file U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax returns. Tax returns for years beginning in 2017 are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and various tax authorities. While we have accrued for amounts we believe are in accordance with the accounting standard, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed annually with guidance provided in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that directly or indirectly affect amounts reported in financial statements.

With over 250,000 security professionals and offices located throughout the United States as well as internationally (Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom), Allied Universal serves approximately 14,800 clients and is responsible for protecting more than 50,000 client sites covering multiple specialty sectors such as higher education, healthcare, retail, commercial real estate, government, and corporate campuses, including a significant portion of the Fortune 500 companies. Allied Universal’s services span manned guarding, innovative technology systems, risk and consulting, janitorial and staffing services, integration services, and digital solutions and remote monitoring. We are responsible for providing “best-in-class” security services that allow clients to completely outsource the recruiting, screening, hiring, training, uniforming, scheduling and supervision of security officers. Our security officers work on-location at customer sites and are responsible for observing, detecting, deterring and reporting and responding to perceived, potential or actual security threats. We also provide specialized security services such as vehicle patrol, visitor management, K-9 security services, top security facility cleared security professionals, and joint security programs. We have an operational presence in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and have a growing presence in Canada, Latin America, and the United Kingdom. In addition to providing manned guarding services, we provide comprehensive technology solutions to our customers, including video surveillance, CCTV picture capture and monitoring, robot patrolling, GPS-based patrol and reporting, management of access control points and centralized security operations. We also offer systems integration services to design, install and service fully integrated technology-based monitoring systems, along with digital solutions and remote monitoring through our MaRC. We are able to leverage our large manned guarding customer base and service platform to cross-sell these additional system integration services. Finally, we offer a range of ancillary services, including temporary and permanent staffing, event staffing and security, janitorial services, and consulting and investigation solutions. Allied Universal was formed in August 2016 through the combination of AlliedBarton and Universal, which brought together two of the leading providers in the security services industry. AlliedBarton, founded in 1957, and Universal, founded in 1965, were leaders in the industry in customer service, organic growth, customer and employee retention, accretive M&A, and had a highly complementary and diverse set of blue chip customers. The combined company became the largest provider of security officer services in North America and has continued to grow since, both organically and through M&A. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Allied Universal acquired U.S. Security Associates Holdings, Inc., a leading North American provider of security solutions, including manned security, consulting, investigations, and disaster and emergency response services. Since 2007, the company has successfully executed 72 acquisitions, including small and large tuck-ins. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Allied announced the acquisition of SOS Security which brought a complementary approach and further scale to Allied Universal. As of 2020, Allied Universal has an estimated 31% share of the highly fragmented outsourced manned guarding security services market in the United States, with a track record of growth driven both organically and through acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we had Pro Forma Combined Adjusted Revenues of $18,357.1 million and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA of $1,955.9 million, respectively.

G4S’s roots can be traced back approximately 120 years ago to 1901, when the guarding company Kjøbenhavn Frederiksberg Nattevagt was established in Denmark. Since then, G4S has expanded both organically and through acquisitions, culminating in the merger of Securicor and Group 4 Falck to create G4S in 2004. G4S is active in 90 countries across the globe, has more than 490,000 security professionals, and purchases goods and services from approximately 40,000 suppliers. G4S has security integration capabilities in more than 40 key markets and more than 13,000 monitored end points with key markets across the Americas, Africa, Asia and EMEA. Key services include system design, integration & maintenance, manned & mobile guarding, monitoring & response, consultancy & risk management, analytics, equipment and software. G4S provides its services to a broad range of customers across various types of sites, including Fortune 500 companies, construction sites and manufacturing facilities, hospital campuses and healthcare facilities, oil, gas, energy and other regulated facilities, financial institutions and banking centers, college and university campuses, courthouses and government buildings, law enforcement support including detainee processing and transport, and gated and residential communities. The G4S business model starts with anticipating customer needs through detailed risk assessments. G4S is investing in the resources, skills and capabilities needed to market, design, build, operate and maintain technologyenabled Integrated Security solutions. Through its Secure Solutions segment, G4S is a global market leader in security, providing both traditional manned-guarding and technology-enabled security solutions in addition to consultancy services and analytics to its customers. G4S uses its expertise, service delivery and integration alongside its geographic scale to differentiate the business to customers, drive outsourcing and enhance the value of traditional security services through greater use of technology. G4S officers are tailored for the specific need of each client, including the following: custom protection officers who meet stringent experience and training requirements and are prepared to step into high profile locations; upscale security officers who perform security patrols of designated areas on foot or in a vehicle; lobby ambassadors who present a professional and courteous appearance while also possessing customer service skills and focus and bank protection officers who provide visible deterrence of criminal activity at entrances of financial institutions and banking centers. Currently, technology-enabled security services represent approximately 45% of Secure Solutions revenue. G4S is focused on pivoting from manned guarding to “predictive” security services with consulting, technology, people and data analytics to continue margin expansion going forward. G4S’s Cash Solutions segment is comprised of the Retail Technology Solutions and Conventional Cash divisions. On February 26, 2020, G4S announced it agreed to sell the majority of its Conventional Cash businesses to Brink’s for cash consideration of £666 million, allowing it to focus on the growth of its core integrated security solutions business and further develop the rapidly growing Retail Technology Solutions business. Retail Technology Solutions provides unique, value-add cash management solutions to clients and goes to market through the brands Retail Cash Solutions, CASH360, Desposita, G4SPay, and South Africa-Deposits. G4S technologies offer a breadth of solutions to clients including automated cash management and reconciliation and unique forecasting tools for retail cash operations. Conventional Cash services include armored cash transportation, typically facilitated between cash centers and customer outlets, as well as counterfeit detection, cash redistribution to banks and ATMs, ATM management, including cash forecasting, replenishment, reconciliation and maintenance, counting and secure international transportation of cash and valuables including, but not limited to, currency, gems and precious metals. G4S’s Consulting Services segment helps clients manage and react to risks, such as risks associated with crime, terrorism and entering into new markets, by providing remote site services and facilities management capability in low infrastructure, conflict afflicted and hostile environments. Such services include security, aviation security, facilities management, life support, remote logistics and fleet management, and training and capacity building services. Additionally, the G4S Ordnance Management teams help clear explosives and other forms of ordnance from sites that were once occupied by ISIS. ----- G4S’s Care & Justice Services segment, which is concentrated in the United Kingdom and Australia, provides custody and detention, rehabilitation, education, employment, electronic monitoring, immigration and borders, police back office support, secure healthcare and non-urgent patient transport services to central and local governments and their agencies, regulatory bodies, UK police forces and the private sector. The Care & Justice Services segment also provides critical primary and forensic healthcare services for the public and private sectors and provides healthcare services within police custody suites and other secure environments, caring for detainee health needs and supporting the collection of forensic samples. Further, as a responsible employer, G4S’s priorities embrace sustainable investment to promote the health and safety of employees, as reflected in the improvement in G4S’s health and safety performance over the past seven years. For example, during 2020, 15 G4S employees lost their lives in the course of carrying out their duties, as compared with 20 fatalities in 2019, which was significantly lower than levels experienced in earlier years, reflecting the benefits of G4S’s health and safety programs. G4S continues to reduce its employee injury rate, and lost time injury rates also improved, falling from 5.7 per 1,000 employees in 2019 to 4.6 in 2020. In addition, during 2020, G4S launched a mental health awareness campaign entitled Ready to Work, recognizing that communities have been under additional stress during the year with the impact of COVID-19, which program will continue into 2021. In terms of risk mitigation, G4S believes that behaving with integrity and respect is key to G4S’ core values, forming an integral part of the G4S’s strategy and an essential foundation on which G4S carries out its business. To that end, in 2020, G4S reviewed and relaunched a number of its ethics and social responsibility policies. G4S’s new Ethics Code sets out the ethical standards which apply to all G4S businesses and employees. This was launched early in 2021, supported by an extensive communications, training and engagement program. In addition, G4S has also updated its whistleblowing policy, anti-bribery & corruption framework and its human rights policy and accompanying guidance. G4S has also refreshed its training program on ABC. To ensure the training is effective and reaches those who need it, in addition to all new employees, all managers and staff with responsibility for making any financial decisions and for controlling assets have been prioritized to undertake the new ABC training and to repeat it annually. Given the significant re-shaping of G4S’s business portfolio in recent years, we believe that the G4S is now positioned to develop an enhanced service mix with a growing proportion of higher value Integrated Security services. The combined benefits of the G4S strategy, strong execution, emphasis on employee health and safety, continued focus on risk mitigation and rapid response to COVID-19 are reflected in G4S’s underlying results for the year ended December 31, 2020.

We estimate that the combination will unlock approximately $155 million in targeted annual cost savings once G4S is fully integrated and our cost savings initiatives have been fully implemented. Allied Universal has a strong track record of successful acquisition integration, including synergy realization. We anticipate that our disciplined management of fixed and variable operating expenses, revenue and financing synergies, as well as ----- corporate overhead and headcount rationalization will primarily drive cost synergies. Historically, we have made a significant number of acquisitions and we have well-developed systems and processes throughout our organization to support integration efforts, resulting in more efficient synergy realization and helping drive overall margin improvement. The overlapping business functions in North America provide a significant opportunity for real estate and personnel rationalization. Due to overlapping operations, we expect significant synergies in the following areas in the North America region: general and administrative expenses, duplicative service contracts, insurance, and facilities expense. Additionally, we will be able to eliminate any expenses in functional support areas that support G4S’s status as a public listed company. Further, we believe opportunities exist to increase operating leverage through diversification across investment in capabilities, such as additional training and technology deployments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.43,Industry Overview Market Overview,17.43.1,,"The global contract security services market is large, has been stable and is expected to continue its consistent growth supported by a number of favorable trends. The US security services market was estimated to generate approximately $66 billion in revenue in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 4% to 5% CAGR from 2021 to 2025. The US security services market for outsourced manned guarding generated over $28 billion in revenue in 2020 and grew at a 4.3% CAGR from 2017 to 2020. The security technology market in the US is also large, with revenues estimated to be approximately $17 billion in 2020, and grew slightly quicker than the manned guarding segment, at a CAGR of approximately 8% from 2017 to 2020. The market was estimated to be comprised of approximately 42% manned guarding and 25% security technology. Internationally, the security services market for manned guarding grew to $34 billion in revenue in 2020 and is expected to reach approximately $40 billion in revenue in 2025, representing an estimated compound annual growth rate of 5% from 2021 to 2025. A heightened focus on security, both in the United States and globally, has been driven by high profile gun violence, domestic terrorism events, a rise in workplace incidents and both peaceful and violent protest events, which have led to increased spending on security. Our service offerings represent an important first line of defense against potential security threats. Meanwhile, mega trends occurring around the world and positive growth tailwinds in the distribution, manufacturing, healthcare and education sectors also support demand for increasing security. In addition, organizations continue to outsource their security services primarily to alleviate administrative burdens and achieve cost savings, while the compelling value proposition delivered through scale, broad service offerings and robust technological infrastructure drive them to shift to highly professionalized providers. Given the high-risk exposure of inadequate security, we believe that customers make purchasing decisions based on service quality, reliability, and reputation, rather than price alone. It has been our experience that customers seek out and maintain long-term relationships with quality providers. For example, industry switching rates have historically been between 10% to 15% on average annually, and customer retention rates are higher for large customers served under national contracts, according to a third party consulting study. Meanwhile, Allied Universal, as a scale provider, experienced below average annual customer switching rates of between 5% to 10%. We believe the industry’s stability in various economic cycles is underpinned by the recession-resistant nature of security services, resulting in limited cyclicality and customer churn. Over a ten-year period, industry growth has been consistent, and historically recession-resistant, experiencing only one year of flat-to-slightly declining growth. The impact of economic downturns on labor markets, which includes higher employee retention, and subsequently lower unbilled overtime, recruiting and training costs, historically have led to EBITDA margin expansion, which has historically been sustained during a return to economic expansion. Our experience during 2020 demonstrates the resiliency of our business model. Despite lockdowns and office closures during the COVID pandemic, security services remained an essential part of real estate management and asset protection. During this period, we also experienced a temporary shift in demand from security services in connection with retail, travel and leisure to grocery and other essential businesses. We also experienced an increase in demand for higher value-add services such as temperature screening. During the summer of 2020, protests and other civil events drove demand for our manned guarding services, providing further diversification and resiliency against office closings. ----- US Outsourced Security Guard Industry ($ in billions)",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Several positive trends support this growth, including: (i) baseline expansion from building stock growth, guard penetration in existing buildings, and wage rate growth which is passed on through the mark-up model used to price security services; (ii) secular demand growth due to heightened focus on security driven by increased acts of violence and media coverage, increasing regulatory and insurance scrutiny; and (iii) increased outsourcing rate for security services. Furthermore, there is a trend toward the centralization of security programs and integration of manned guarding with technology solutions, both of which favor best-in-class national providers. As the national player with vertical markets expertise and differentiated integrated security and technology solutions, we are well-positioned to benefit from favorable industry tailwinds. Globally, demand for security services has also increased steadily and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% between 2020 and 2024. Demand is driven by similar factors as in the United States as well as elevated safety and security risks and concerns driven by geopolitical events such as refuge crises, increased wealth driven by urbanization, global GDP growth, rising labor costs supporting demand for higher-value, technology-enabled, integrated security solutions and demand for higher-value service lines driven by more advanced technology capabilities.

While building stock growth provides strong underlying support for the security services market, it is not necessary to sustain growth within our existing customer bases. A growing economy drives up overall wage rates, increases statutory minimum wages and provides union increases, all which are typically passed on to customers through a stable mark-up. Increased wage rates are expected to continue driving further expansion of the manned guarding market and increase revenue generation from existing clients.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

In cases of security incidents, customers value the officers’ ability to provide immediate response. Technology can enhance and significantly improve security but we believe there is no substitute for the physical presence of well-trained and dedicated security personnel who can respond to threats in real-time. ----- The demand for security services continues to increase due to heightened security concerns stemming from the ongoing threat of terrorism and high profile gun violence, large protest events, heightened importance of public and workplace safety, refugee crises and the growing need to supplement services provided by the public sector. Heightened media coverage of security lapses, growing costs of disruption, and stricter security requirements by government institutions and private insurers have forced organizations to take greater responsibility for their own security.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.47,Increased Outsourcing to Third-party Providers with National and Global Scale,17.47.1,,"Currently, approximately 65% of manned security services in the United States are outsourced to professional security services firms, and this outsourcing rate is expected to increase incrementally over time. The trend toward outsourcing is expected to continue to drive growth in the industry due to the strong value proposition of contract security service providers and non-core nature of security for the vast majority of companies. Due to the growing complexity surrounding security-related issues and increased demand for vertical segment expertise and customized guarding services, outsourcing security services to “best-in-class” providers continues to be an attractive option for customers. Contract security services firms can offer customers improved security, reduced non-core administrative burden, and competitive pricing through operating leverage, each of which are compelling reasons supporting the trend toward outsourcing various business services. Outsourcing of non-core functions has not only become a corporate best practice, but also a function of the public sector as governments look to minimize cost. Outsourcing allows companies and governments to reduce labor costs and shift the administrative burden of non-core functions to third-party vendors with more experience, operating leverage, and functional area expertise. As one of the few security and facility services providers with national and global scale, we believe the combined Allied Universal and G4S business is well-positioned to benefit from the trend toward outsourcing security services. For example, we are able to address customers’ increasingly complex security needs and their preference for best-in-class providers with strong reputations and vertical markets expertise, rather than local providers. In addition, as national customers increasingly seek to consolidate vendors, they build relationships with national partners that can reliably and consistently serve them across multiple regions. Finally, the increased centralization of procurement continues to drive the shift in customer decision-making from a local level to a multi-region and national level, providing an opportunity for national providers to increase customer penetration.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Security services providers such as Allied Universal and G4S continue to broaden their portfolio of services by combining value-added offerings like access controls, ID verification, video monitoring, and communications systems with traditional security officer and patrol services. Customers seek integration between manned guarding services and complementary technology solutions in order to improve and reduce the complexity of their security operations. Existing customer relationships create the ability to cross-sell services for the installation, integration and maintenance of physical technology systems that augment manned guarding services. Integrated technology solutions enhance the value delivered to customers and foster customer retention.

Early in the pandemic, security professionals were generally deemed essential by health authorities and continued to deliver security services to a range of customers. Minor business disruptions at the onset of lockdowns led to a slight pullback in hours relative to the preCOVID period. Allied Universal has so far successfully managed the pandemic and performance has been highly resilient both in top line growth and in margin expansion. Hours have since rebounded and even increased in some regions as COVID-related restrictions have eased and economic activity continues to rebound, while increased security concerns remain. Services have continued to expand as customers seek a partner to help implement and execute new policies and procedures at guarded sites, in addition to offering additional services such as temperature checks. An enhanced focus on innovative technology solutions drives further upside for security providers that offer fully integrated solutions. Allied Universal’s resilient top-line is driven by the contractual revenue streams with daily re-occurrence of services, the critical nature of security to operations, and the low cost of security services relative to the high cost of failure. The company typically benefits from rising wages as increases are passed on to clients, who generally expect a 2% to 3% annual increase in billing rates, in-line with wage growth. Tightening labor markets result in stable margins, while softer markets typically drive margin expansion as the increased supply of labor reduces the spread between bill rates and employee pay rates.

From 2016 to 2020, Allied Universal’s mark-up has remained constant at 1.48x. This stable mark-up reflects the strong track record of passing on cost increases to clients and expanding margins. Our ability to pass through labor costs and other variable expenses to our clients allows us to generate consistent profitability and produce cash flows with low volatility.

We believe the Securadyne acquisition provided us with the footprint and scalable infrastructure that enables us to deliver complementary security integration services to a significantly larger portion of the existing approximately 50,000 client sites where we provide manned guarding services today. In addition to system installation, maintenance, robots, and monitoring, we have integrated technology into our manned guarding services and are in the process of deploying a custom IMS that provides real-time incident data reporting and situational awareness information powered by artificial intelligence. The proprietary application, HeliAUS, provides in-depth incident reporting, data collection, and predictive analytics, allowing managers and clients to spot trends and react quickly, while improving workforce supervision and improving liability management. The highly scalable platform is delivered to customers via a monthly subscription and is billed directly to users as a supplement to manned guarding services. Beyond our technology offerings, we intend to continue to grow our janitorial and staffing services, which are a portfolio of offerings including cleaning services and a provider of skilled talent across a diverse set of industries such as traditional janitorial functions as well as highly specialized cleaning services such as bio- hazard disposal, IT room cleaning, and recycling programs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.61,Proven Platform for Disciplined M&A,17.61.1,,"We benefit from our significant experience in successfully integrating acquisitions while maintaining relationships with both existing and acquired customers. The largely fragmented security services industry has historically provided opportunities to supplement our strong organic growth with a disciplined acquisition strategy. A large and fragmented international market, as well as relevant adjacent markets, provides additional opportunity for targeted expansion. Our approach to acquisitions has been highly methodical and focused on scale-building and infill acquisitions. Integration occurs quickly, generally within 30 days for a typical tuck-in acquisition, making for a seamless transition for customers. ----- Allied Universal has proven experience executing all types of transactions, including 72 small tuck-ins and large transformational acquisitions since 2007. On average, these acquisitions were completed at credit accretive, midsingle digit multiples. In addition to many small and medium tuck-ins, we have a proven track record of successfully executing and integrating transformative acquisitions, as evidenced by the combination of AlliedBarton and Universal in August 2016, as well as the large tuck-in acquisition of USSA, formerly the fourth-largest manned guarding provider in the United States in 2018. The combination of our smaller tuck-in acquisitions along with our ability to acquire targets of scale, such as USSA, demonstrate our disciplined ability to take advantage of growth opportunities as they become available. We believe we are an “acquirer of choice” due to our strong reputation and track record and are the bestpositioned consolidator in a highly fragmented market. A significant portion of our past acquisitions have been completed on a proprietary basis. Additionally, we estimate that over 40% of the outsourced manned guarding services market in the United States is comprised of over 7,000 firms and roughly 60% of the security technology services market is comprised of over 3,000 firms, providing a large opportunity set for further accretive consolidation. We benefit from significant industrial logic from on-boarding sub-scale providers onto our scalable platform which drives the ability to expand margins of acquired companies. We believe the combination of Allied Universal and G4S will allow us to execute further our disciplined and well-demonstrated M&A playbook in key markets globally.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

We engage with our customers through a variety of methods, including a consultative approach to selling and bidding for contracts, proactive relationship management and a sharp focus on customer service. Key areas of interests for customers include quality and price of service delivery, expertise and innovation, health and safety and business ethics. However, the industries in which we operate are competitive. We directly compete with companies that are national and international in scope. We also compete with smaller local and regional companies that may have better knowledge of the local conditions in their regions, are better known locally and are better able to gain customers in their regions. There are relatively low barriers to entry in the industries in which we operate, and we have faced and expect to continue to face additional competition from new entrants. We also face increased competition from technology companies as digital advancement develops, which may lead to pricing pressure and service changes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—The industries in which we operate are intensely competitive and price-sensitive. If we cannot successfully compete with new or existing providers of products and services similar to ours or enhance our existing products and services, our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.” The United States contract security officer industry is highly competitive but fragmented. We also compete with numerous smaller regional and local security service providers in the United States. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the security service market are: - the quality of security officers, including length of service and tenure; - supervision, recruiting, selecting and training of security officers; - management quality and responsiveness; - the ability to handle multiple sites nationwide; and - price in relation to the quality of service. Rapid technological advances, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Relevant regulation for our operations and employees includes such matters as consumer protection, fair trade, jurisdiction-specific security industry regulation (including with respect to hardware requirements or operational requirements), data privacy, occupational health and safety, marketing and competition law. Additionally, most states in the United States have laws, or legislation pending, requiring qualification, training and registration of security officers, regulating the use of identification cards, badges and uniforms and imposing minimum bond surety or insurance standards. In order to install a security system, we generally must be licensed in the jurisdiction where we are installing the system. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—Our business operates in a regulated industry, and noncompliance with regulations could materially restrict our operations and expose us to fines, penalties and other liabilities and negative consequences.” Additionally, we generally must obtain operating certificates or permits for our security systems, and provide specified levels of training to our employees at those centers. Our international operations are subject to risks that are different from those we face in the United States and subject us to complex and frequently changing laws and regulations, including differing labor laws and regulations relating to the protection of certain information that we collect and maintain about our employees, clients and other third parties. We operate under many complex and diverse regulatory frameworks, some of which have extraterritorial reach and many where regulations change frequently. Among these laws are the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018.

We believe that our relationships with our employees are good, and we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes. With over 740,000 security professionals on a combined basis delivering critically important services across every continent, employee and customer safety is of paramount importance to us. We have a continuing focus on enhancing safety policies, standards and culture and our goal is zero harm. The nature of our work and the environments in which we operate mean that security and safety present an operational and strategic risk to our business and, from time to time, members of our workforce may be subject to injuries and fatalities.

We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these claims and proceedings. For a description of certain ongoing and past litigations, see “Risk Factors—Risk Related to Our Business—We are subject to risks from litigation or legal proceedings, as well as tax audits, which could adversely affect our financial results and condition.” Under the laws of many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be held liable for the negligent acts or misconduct of our agents or employees performed while on duty and in the course and scope of their employment. We experience a significant volume of claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business asserting that we are liable for damages as a result of the conduct of our employees or others. From time to time individuals bring personal injury lawsuits against us seeking substantial damages based on alleged negligence or other theories of liability in our provision of security services, including with respect to injuries not directly caused by, or within the control of, our security officers. Under principles of common law, we generally can be held liable for wrongful acts or omissions to act of our agents or employees during the course, and within the scope, of their agency or employment with us. In addition, many of our customer contracts contain provisions whereby we are contractually obligated to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our clients. These provisions vary from indemnification for our own negligence and misconduct to providing indemnification for any claims related to our services regardless of our fault. In a limited number of situations, we may also be contractually required to indemnify our customers in cases of their own contributory negligence. We are also subject to a significant number of wage and hour class actions and multi-plaintiff lawsuits, singleemployee lawsuits, Private Attorneys General Act claims and attorney demands, in addition to wage and hour governmental audits. We maintain insurance coverage, subject to certain self-insured retention limits, for workers’ compensation, general liability, employment practices liability and healthcare claims (under employee medical benefit plans), which we believe adequately insure us. We also seek to mitigate this risk exposure through indemnification or liability limitations in our contracts, analysis of customer facilities and implementation of programs for employee screening, training, supervision and safety and anonymous reporting by our employees. We believe that we have established adequate reserves for litigation liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Currently, we are involved in certain legal and governmental matters, such as the DPA that G4S entered into with the SFO in respect of the UK Care & Justice electronic monitoring contract investigation, inquiries that G4S received from the BCA and DoJ in connection with G4S’s Belgian business, class action litigation relating to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act relating to alleged support provided by G4S to the Taliban ----- in Afghanistan and certain claims in India relating to the India Provident Fund, as further described under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—The nature of our business exposes us to significant risks related to legal proceedings, claims, governmental inquiries and investigations, and negative press and media investigations that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, and results of operations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—We are subject to risks from litigation or legal proceedings, as well as tax audits, which could adversely affect our financial results and condition” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industries—The security services we provide may subject us to liability for substantial damages not covered by insurance.” We currently do not expect any of these matters nor any other legal or governmental matters we are involved in to have a material adverse effect on our combined business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but we can provide no assurance on the future developments or outcomes of any such arbitrations and/or legal proceedings discussed in this offering circular, including the G4S matters discussed above.

The payment of all sums expressed to be payable by G4S Finance in relation to the G4S Notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by G4S under a trust deed relating to the relevant G4S Notes (the “G4S Trust Deed”). The obligations of G4S under the guarantees are direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and (subject to the terms of the negative pledge as summarised below) unsecured obligations of G4S and (save for certain obligations required to be preferred by law) rank equally with all other unsecured obligations (other than any subordinated obligations) of G4S from time to time outstanding. ----- The obligations of G4S Finance under the 2019 Note Purchase Agreement and in respect of the 2019 Private Placement Senior Notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by G4S. The 2019 Note Purchase Agreement also permits, and, if any subsidiary acts as a borrower, issuer or guarantor under any Principal Bank Facility (as defined in the 2019 Note Purchase Agreement) or the 2007 Note Purchase Agreement requires, G4S Finance to obtain guarantees from such subsidiaries of its obligations under and in respect of the 2019 Note Purchase Agreement and the 2019 Private Placement Senior Notes. As of the date hereof, G4S Secure Solutions (USA) Inc. and G4S Holding One, Inc. are subsidiary guarantors and have entered into subsidiary guarantee agreements with respect to such subsidiary guarantees. The obligations of G4S and the subsidiary guarantors rank _pari passu_ in right of payment without preference or priority, with all unsecured and unsubordinated financial indebtedness of such guarantor. The 2007 Note Purchase Agreement permits, and, if any subsidiary acts as a borrower, issuer or guarantor under any Principal Bank Facility (as defined in the 2007 Note Purchase Agreement) or the 2019 Note Purchase Agreement requires, G4S to obtain guarantees from such subsidiaries of its obligations under and in respect of the 2007 Note Purchase Agreement and the 2007 Private Placement Senior Notes. As of the date hereof, G4S Secure Solutions (USA) Inc., G4S Holding One, Inc. and G4S Finance are subsidiary guarantors and have entered into subsidiary guarantee agreements with respect to such subsidiary guarantees. The obligations of the subsidiary guarantors rank pari passu in right of payment without preference or priority, with all unsecured and unsubordinated financial indebtedness of such subsidiary guarantor. The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will, jointly and severally, unconditionally Guarantee, on a secured senior basis, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuers under the Secured Indenture and the Secured Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts on or in respect of the Secured Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Secured Indenture by executing the Secured Indenture or a supplement thereto. From and after the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuers under the Secured Notes and the Secured Indenture will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally Guaranteed on a secured senior basis (the “Secured Note _Guarantees”) by (i) each existing and future Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary that Guarantees the Issuer’s_ obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and certain capital markets debt securities of the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or any Guarantor, subject to release as provided below or elsewhere in this “Description of Secured Notes” and (ii) each Issue Date Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor. In addition, certain U.S. and Foreign Subsidiaries of the Issuer incorporated in either Luxembourg or England and Wales will also provide a Secured Note Guarantee by entering into a supplemental indenture to the Secured Indenture, the Collateral Documents and joinders to the Intercreditor Agreements by the later of (i) 150 days after the Issue Date and (ii) the date on which such U.S. and Foreign Subsidiaries provide a guarantee under the Senior Credit Facilities. Following the Issue Date, Subsidiaries of the Issuer will be required to Guarantee the Secured Notes to the extent described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees.” At its option, any Parent Entity may Guarantee the Secured Notes, but will not be subject to any of the covenants under the Secured Indenture. Each Secured Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be: - a general secured senior obligation of such Guarantor; ----- - _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness (including Guarantees of the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Notes) of such Guarantor; - secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral owned by the Guarantors (other than Excluded Assets or ABL Collateral), which assets also secure the Guarantors’ obligations under the Credit Agreements and the Existing 2026 Secured Notes Indenture ratably on a pari passu basis, subject to certain Liens permitted under the Secured Indenture, and secured on a second-priority basis by the ABL Collateral that secures the ABL Credit Facility on a first-priority basis and the Credit Agreements and the Existing 2026 Secured Notes on a pari passu basis, subject to certain Liens permitted under the Secured Indenture; - effectively senior to any unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the Collateral of such Guarantor securing the Secured Notes, including such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Notes; - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and other liabilities of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; and - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor. Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Secured Notes, and Secured Note Guarantees provided may be released in certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes— Claims of holders of the notes offered hereby will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes offered hereby.” In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer, the Co-Issuers or a Guarantor, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuers, including Holders. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our Non-Guarantors, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Secured Notes. Although the Secured Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. The Secured Indenture will not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness that may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the Non-Guarantors. See “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Issuers and the Guarantors (exclusive of the Target and its consolidated Subsidiaries) represented approximately 95.6% of the Issuer’s total revenues, 85.0% of the Issuer’s total assets and 95.6% of the Issuer’s total liabilities, after excluding intercompany transactions and balances. In addition and subject to certain exceptions and the Agreed Security Principles, the Target and each of the Target’s material Subsidiaries incorporated in the United States, Luxembourg and England and Wales will guarantee the Secured Notes by the later of (i) 150 days after the Issue Date and (ii) the date on which such U.S. or Foreign Subsidiaries provide a Guarantee under the Senior Credit Facilities. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, Target entities organized in the United States, Luxembourg and England and Wales represented approximately 49.0% of the Target’s total revenues and 61.0% of the Target’s total assets. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Secured Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Secured Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference under applicable law, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Secured Note Guarantees provided by Guarantors that are Foreign Subsidiaries will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles. Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Liens,” in respect of guarantees or collateral provided by or over the assets of (or equity interests in) Foreign Subsidiaries, certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights ----- and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles.

(c) the determination that, in respect of any guarantee or security which it is determined may be required to be discharged and/or released in connection with any corporate, tax structuring or other reorganization of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (an “Anticipated Reorganization”), the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs guarantee fees payable to any person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and all applicable legal fees) of taking, and then subsequently discharging and/or releasing such guarantee or security in connection with any Anticipated Reorganization, will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security; (d) subject to certain exceptions, that members of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in any jurisdiction outside of the United States of America (other than Atlas LuxCo 1 S.à r.l. or any whollyowned subsidiary of Atlas LuxCo 1 S.à r.l.) will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Security Documents if they are not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(g) the agreement that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets; (h) the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from ----- being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or any member thereof; provided that reasonable efforts (for a period of not more than 20 Business Days but without incurring material cost) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries if the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such efforts will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy; (i) the agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct their operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Secured Notes Documents (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Event of Default which is continuing); (j) the agreement that any security document will only be required to be notarised if required by law in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence; (k) the agreement that, on request, no guarantee or security will be required to be given (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) by or over any acquired entity or business (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Target and its Subsidiaries) which are required to guarantee, secure or otherwise credit support Indebtedness acquired in connection with an acquisition which is not prohibited by the Secured Notes Documents (or in each case (Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness) (“Applicable Debt”) to the extent such indebtedness is permitted by the Secured Notes Documents to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition not prohibited by the Secured Notes Documents (or the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries making such acquisition) shall be required to become a guarantor or grant security with respect to any Secured Notes Documents if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing the Applicable Debt or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto. No security or Lien in favour of the other Secured Parties will be granted or continue to subsist over any asset of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries secured for the benefit of any Permitted Indebtedness (including Applicable Debt) and to the extent constituting a Lien permitted by the Secured Notes Documents; (l) the agreement that no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required; (m) the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document); (n) the agreement that neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment, sub-participation or transfer by any relevant secured party (and unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Secured Notes Documents the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment, sub-participation or transfer by any relevant secured party); ----- (o) the agreement that each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction not prohibited under the Secured Notes Documents and the security granted under each security document entered into after the Issue Date shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant security document and creation of the relevant security; (p) the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions (or any substantially equivalent provisions) in the Intercreditor Agreements; (q) the agreement that the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the Secured Notes Documents prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing; (r) the agreement that no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap _Obligations” defined in accordance with the Loan Syndications and Trading Association’s (the_ “LSTA”) Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations' _Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;_ (s) the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries; (t) the agreement that no fixed security will be required to be granted over real estate, intellectual property, letter of credit rights, tort claims (or the equivalent in any jurisdiction), insurance policies, aircraft, ships and vessels, motor vehicles, governmental contracts or governmental or regulatory licenses; (u) the agreement that no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be required to be prepared or provided to the relevant secured party (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) unless (i) required for such documents to become effective or admissible in evidence, and (ii) an Event of Default is continuing; (v) the fact that closure, unavailability, or reduced service of any governmental or regulatory systems, any functions or any facilities (including notarial or legal facilities) necessary or customarily used for the granting of security or guarantees, or the taking of any perfection requirements in connection therewith, may affect and/or delay the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to provide a guarantee or security or take any related steps in connection with any perfection requirements; and (w) the agreement that where the terms of a security document require a party thereto (other than any secured party) to use its “reasonable efforts,” “reasonable endeavours” or a similar or equivalent standard in taking an action thereunder, notwithstanding any meaning to the contrary as a matter of the governing law of such security document, such standards shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales and no Default or Event of Default (howsoever described) shall arise under any Secured Notes Documents in respect of a breach of such obligation because a contrary construction of such provision was taken (or would be taken by any applicable court of competent jurisdiction). By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Secured Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Secured Note Guarantee. If a Secured Note Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be declared entirely void or subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Secured Note Guarantee could be reduced to zero.

Following the Issue Date, Subsidiaries of the Issuer will be required to Guarantee the Notes to the extent described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees.” At its option, any Parent Entity may Guarantee the Notes, but will not be subject to any of the covenants under the Indenture. Each Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be: - a general unsecured senior obligation of such Guarantor; - _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness (including Guarantees of the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the Secured Notes) of such Guarantor; - effectively subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness (including Guarantees of the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Secured Notes) of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the collateral of such Guarantor securing such Secured Indebtedness; - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and other liabilities of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; and - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor. Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Notes, and Note Guarantees provided may be released in certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Claims of holders of the notes offered hereby will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes offered hereby.” In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuers, including Holders. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our Non-Guarantors, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. The Indenture will not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness that may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the Non-Guarantors. See “— Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Issuers and the Guarantors (exclusive of the Target and its consolidated Subsidiaries) represented approximately 95.6% of the Issuer’s total revenues, 85.0% of the Issuer’s total assets and 95.6% of the Issuer’s total liabilities, after excluding intercompany transactions and balances. In addition and subject to certain exceptions and the Agreed Security Principles, the Target and each of the Target’s material Subsidiaries incorporated in the United States, Luxembourg and England and Wales will guarantee ----- the Notes by the later of (i) 150 days after the Issue Date and (ii) the date on which such U.S. or Foreign Subsidiaries provide a Guarantee under the Senior Credit Facilities. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, Target entities organized in the United States, Luxembourg and England and Wales represented approximately 49.0% of the Target’s total revenues and 61.0% of the Target’s total assets. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference under applicable law, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees provided by Guarantors that are Foreign Subsidiaries will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles. Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Liens,” in respect of guarantees or collateral provided by or over the assets of (or equity interests in) Foreign Subsidiaries, certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among others: (a) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalisation,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign _corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules_ and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles; (b) the determination that the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes (including, in respect of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, their investors and/or their shareholders), interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs guarantee fees payable to any Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and all applicable legal fees) would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security; (c) the determination that, in respect of any guarantee or security which it is determined may be required to be discharged and/or released in connection with any corporate, tax structuring or other reorganization of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (an “Anticipated Reorganization”), the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs guarantee fees payable to any person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and all applicable legal fees) of taking, and then subsequently discharging and/or releasing such guarantee or security in connection with any Anticipated Reorganization, will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security; (d) subject to certain exceptions, that members of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in any jurisdiction outside of the United States of America (other than Atlas LuxCo 1 S.à r.l. or any whollyowned subsidiary of Atlas LuxCo 1 S.à r.l.) will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Security Documents if they are not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries; _provided that reasonable efforts (for a period of not more than 10 Business Days but without_ incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit; ----- (e) the agreement that guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the Issuer and the collateral agent under the Credit Agreements in accordance with the terms of the corresponding Credit Agreements; (f) the agreement that where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material assets only; (g) the agreement that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets; (h) the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or any member thereof; provided that reasonable efforts (for a period of not more than 20 Business Days but without incurring material cost) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries if the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such efforts will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy; (i) the agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct their operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Note Documents (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Event of Default which is continuing); (j) the agreement that any security document will only be required to be notarised if required by law in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence; (k) the agreement that, on request, no guarantee or security will be required to be given (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) by or over any acquired entity or business (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Target and its Subsidiaries) which are required to guarantee, secure or otherwise credit support Indebtedness acquired in connection with an acquisition which is not prohibited by the Note Documents (or in each case (Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness) (“Applicable Debt”) to the extent such indebtedness is permitted by the Note Documents to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition not prohibited by the Note Documents (or the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries making such acquisition) shall be required to become a guarantor or grant security with respect to any Note Documents if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing the Applicable Debt or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto. No security or Lien in favour of the other Secured Parties will be granted or continue to subsist over any asset of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries secured for the benefit of any Permitted Indebtedness (including Applicable Debt) and to the extent constituting a Lien permitted by the Note Documents; (l) the agreement that no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required; ----- (m) the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document); (n) the agreement that neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment, sub-participation or transfer by any relevant secured party (and unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Note Documents the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment, sub-participation or transfer by any relevant secured party); (o) the agreement that each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction not prohibited under the Note Documents and the security granted under each security document entered into after the Issue Date shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant security document and creation of the relevant security; (p) the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions (or any substantially equivalent provisions) in the applicable intercreditor agreements; (q) the agreement that the relevant secured parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the Note Documents prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing; (r) the agreement that no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap _Obligations” defined in accordance with the Loan Syndications and Trading Association’s (the_ “LSTA”) Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations' _Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;_ (s) the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries; (t) the agreement that no fixed security will be required to be granted over real estate, intellectual property, letter of credit rights, tort claims (or the equivalent in any jurisdiction), insurance policies, aircraft, ships and vessels, motor vehicles, governmental contracts or governmental or regulatory licenses; (u) the agreement that no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be required to be prepared or provided to the relevant secured party (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) unless (i) required for such documents to become effective or admissible in evidence, and (ii) an Event of Default is continuing; (v) the fact that closure, unavailability, or reduced service of any governmental or regulatory systems, any functions or any facilities (including notarial or legal facilities) necessary or customarily used for the granting of security or guarantees, or the taking of any perfection requirements in connection therewith, may affect and/or delay the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to provide a guarantee or security or take any related steps in connection with any perfection requirements; and (w) the agreement that where the terms of a security document require a party thereto (other than any secured party) to use its “reasonable efforts,” “reasonable endeavours” or a similar or equivalent ----- standard in taking an action thereunder, notwithstanding any meaning to the contrary as a matter of the governing law of such security document, such standards shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales and no Default or Event of Default (howsoever described) shall arise under any Note Documents in respect of a breach of such obligation because a contrary construction of such provision was taken (or would be taken by any applicable court of competent jurisdiction). By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. If a Note Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be declared entirely void or subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Note Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to avoid the notes offered hereby and the guarantees, and the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes offered hereby, the guarantees and the liens securing the secured notes offered hereby and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes offered hereby to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens in respect of the secured notes offered hereby and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes offered hereby.” The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor (including to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or another Guarantor), in each case, if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (2) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of its Guarantees of payment (i) by the Issuer of any Indebtedness of the Issuer under the Senior Credit Facilities or (ii) as a result of the Guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Issuers or a Guarantor which resulted in the creation of such Note Guarantee, except in the case of clause (i) or (ii), a release or discharge by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release) and will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”; (3) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (4) the exercise by the Issuers of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as provided in “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the satisfaction and discharge of the Issuers’ obligations under the Indenture as provided in “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; (5) to the extent that such Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of clause (i) of the definition of “Immaterial Subsidiary,” upon the release of the Guarantee referred to in such clause; ----- (6) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer, the CoIssuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (7) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; provided that such Note Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and (8) as described under the caption “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Note Guarantee by a Parent Entity may be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged for any reason.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

By their acceptance of the Secured Notes, the Holders will agree to be bound by the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed to have authorized and directed the Notes Collateral Agent to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The term “Collateral” as used in the description of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement means the Collateral on which the collateral agents of two or more classes of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority have a valid and perfected Lien. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will be represented by the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of the Existing 2026 Secured Notes will be represented by the Existing 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of the Credit Agreement Obligations will be represented by the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the holders of each class of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations will be represented by their designated agent (each, an “Authorized Representative”).

The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement also provides that only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” will have the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Collateral.

Following the Applicable Authorized Agent Change Date, the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative, will become the Applicable Authorized Representative. As of any date, the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” is the Authorized Representative of the largest class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority then-outstanding (other than the same class as the class of Indebtedness represented by then Applicable Authorized Representative). The “Non-Controlling Authorized _Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 120 days (throughout which 120-day period the applicable_ Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default under the terms of the class of Indebtedness represented by such Authorized Representative and (b) the Notes Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default with respect to the class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority represented by the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority is currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of that class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority; provided that such event of default under the terms of the class of Indebtedness represented by such Authorized Representative shall be continuing at the end of such 120-day period; provided, further, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral; (2) at any time the Issuers or any other Grantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or (3) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative is stayed under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement from pursuing enforcement action with respect to such Collateral. Only the Applicable Collateral Agent will and will have the right to exercise, or refrain from exercising, any rights, remedies and powers with respect to the Collateral, including any action to enforce their respective security interest in or realize upon any Collateral and any right, remedy or power with respect to any Collateral under any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), and then only on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not be required to, and shall not, follow any instructions or directions with respect to Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Collateral) from any Non-Controlling Secured Party, it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any such instruction or direction by the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose such collateral agent to liability or be contrary to any security document or applicable law, and (iii) no Non-Controlling Secured Party shall, or shall instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any ----- action to take possession of, take any other action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or exercise any other right, remedy or power with respect to (including any right, remedy or power under any intercreditor agreement other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) any Collateral, whether under any credit document, applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the Applicable Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative and in accordance with the applicable security documents, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such rights, remedies and powers with respect to Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens established under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) may deal with the Collateral as if such collateral agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party, or any other exercise by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights, remedies or powers with respect to the Collateral, or seek to cause either Collateral Agent to do so. “Applicable Collateral Agent” means (i) until the earlier of (x) the discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and (ii) from and after the earlier of (x) the discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the Additional Collateral Agent. “Additional Collateral Agent” means, with respect to the Shared Collateral (x) for so long as the Secured Notes are the only class of Indebtedness outstanding, the Notes Collateral Agent and (y) thereafter, the Collateral Agent of the same class as the Authorized Representative that is the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to such Collateral at such time. “Controlling Secured Parties” means, at any time with respect to any Collateral, (i) at any time when the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Credit Agreement Secured Parties and (ii) at any other time, the Secured Parties of the same class as the Authorized Representative that is the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to such Collateral at such time. “Non-Controlling Secured Parties” means, at any time with respect to any Collateral, the Secured Parties that are not Controlling Secured Parties at such time with respect to such Collateral. If (i) an event of default has occurred and is continuing under any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority, and any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, (ii) any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuers or any other Grantor or (iii) any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party receives any payment with respect to any Collateral pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or exercise of remedies, and any such distributions or payments received by Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party, will be applied among the Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority to the payment in full of all such Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Notes Collateral Agent, any other collateral agent with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority and the other Authorized Representatives, in their capacities as such. None of the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority may institute any suit or assert in any suit or other proceeding any claim against the Notes Collateral Agent, any other collateral agent with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority or any other holder of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, in each case, as a result of the enforcement of remedies, at any time prior to the discharge of each of such Indebtedness, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. ----- The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of each class (and not the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class) bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class is unenforceable under applicable Law or is subordinated to any other obligations (other than to any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class), (ii) any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class does not have a valid and perfected Lien on any of the Collateral securing any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority but junior to the security interest of any other class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority, or (b) the existence of any Collateral securing Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class that does not constitute Collateral with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class (any condition referred to in clause (a) or (b) with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class being referred to as an “Impairment” of such class).

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by electronic delivery in accordance with the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent, to each Holder of Secured ----- Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant, and that all Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuers; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), subject to extension (in the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of Control is delayed; (3) that any Secured Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Secured Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Secured Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Secured Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Secured Notes completed, to the applicable Paying Agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Secured Notes and their election to require the Issuers to purchase such Secured Notes; provided that the applicable Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile transmission, electronic transmission or letter (or otherwise compliance with the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable) setting forth the name of the Holder of the Secured Notes, the principal amount of Secured Notes tendered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Secured Notes and its election to have such Secured Notes purchased; (7) that Holders whose Secured Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Secured Notes and such new Secured Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Secured Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 and the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 must be equal to at least $200,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, the unpurchased portion of the Euro Secured Notes must be equal to at least €100,000 or any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof and the unpurchased portion of the Sterling Secured Notes must be equal to at least £100,000 or any integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof; (8) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and describing each such condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of such Change of Control was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions are satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion), or such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions are not satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion) by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuers’ discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Issuers any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied. In addition, the Issuers may provide in such notice that payment of the purchase price and performance of the Issuers’ obligations with respect to such Change of Control Offer may be performed by another Person; and (9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Secured Notes repurchased. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the ----- repurchase of Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Secured Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Secured Notes issued by them or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the applicable Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Secured Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee or the applicable Registrar for cancellation the Secured Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Secured Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Secured Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing 2026 Secured Notes and the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes provide, the Unsecured Notes will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control or a change of control under the Existing 2026 Secured Notes, the Existing 2027 Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Notes). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources and sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby.” The Change of Control purchase feature of the Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Secured Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Secured Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Secured Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Secured Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to a series of Secured Notes following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Secured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Secured Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn under ----- such Change of Control Offer, (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Secured Notes of such series has been given pursuant to the Secured Indenture as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable Redemption Date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied or (iii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuers (or any Affiliate of the Issuers) have made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Secured Notes of such series validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and have purchased all Secured Notes of such series properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Secured Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as described above. The provisions under the Secured Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligations to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of Change of Control, may be waived or modified (at any time, including after a Change of Control) with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Secured Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuers will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuers have previously or substantially concurrently therewith electronically delivered or mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change _of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if_ any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase (provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by electronic delivery in accordance with the procedures of DTC or first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such ----- Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant, and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuers; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered (the “Change of Control Payment _Date”), subject to extension (in the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to_ the occurrence of the Change of Control) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of Control is delayed; (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the Paying Agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers to purchase such Notes; provided that the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile transmission, electronic transmission or letter (or otherwise in compliance with the procedures of DTC) setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (7) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $200,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; (8) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and describing each such condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of such Change of Control was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions are satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion), or such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions are not satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion) by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuers’ discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Issuers any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied.

To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds or Available Proceeds payable in respect of the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 or the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 or the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2 shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Dollars. To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds or Available Proceeds payable in respect of the Euro Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Euro Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euros that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Euros. To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds or Available Proceeds payable in respect of the Sterling Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than Sterling, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Sterling Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Sterling that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Sterling. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Available Proceeds of any Asset Sale received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is ----- (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated under applicable local law, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts shall not be so applied so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law, documents or agreements will not permit repatriation (the Issuer hereby agrees to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the Issuer’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other impediment, an amount equal to such Net Proceeds (net of additional Taxes that would be payable or reserved against as a result of such repatriation but only to the extent such Taxes do not reduce Net Proceeds pursuant to the definition thereof) will be promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment out of such Net Proceeds whereby doing so the Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries, any Parent Entity or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a Tax liability, including a Tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding Tax), an amount equal to the Net Proceeds so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. When the Available Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such Available Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase Secured Notes as described in clause (1)(a) or (1)(c) above, will be deemed to have been so applied whether or not such offer is accepted) exceeds the greater of $780.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA (such amount of Available Proceeds that are less than or equal to the greater of $780.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Declined Excess Proceeds,” and such amount of Available Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $780.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth above, the Issuers will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Secured Notes and, at the option of the Issuers, to any holders of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is, (i) in the case of the USD Secured Notes Tranche 1 and the USD Secured Notes Tranche 2, in an amount equal to at least $200,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, (ii) in the case of the Euro Secured Notes, in an amount equal to at least €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof and (iii) in the case of the Sterling Secured Notes, in an amount equal to at least £100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof, in each case, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Secured Notes of the applicable series, in cash in an amount equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Secured Indenture (and, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, such other price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness). The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 30 days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period by delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Secured Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent. The Issuers may, at their option, satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Available Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Available Proceeds prior to the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period (the “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the Available Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Secured Indenture or with respect to any Declined Excess Proceeds. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Secured Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in Declined Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Secured Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Secured Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the ----- amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall select the Secured Notes (while the Secured Notes are in global form pursuant to the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered; _provided that no Secured Notes will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion_ of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Available Proceeds and Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) will be reset to zero. An Asset Sale Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Secured Indenture, Secured Notes and/or Secured Note Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Secured Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Secured Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The provisions under the Secured Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligations to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding. The Senior Credit Facilities may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuers become parties may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Secured Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of their lenders to the purchase of the Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuers will remain prohibited from purchasing the Secured Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Secured Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Secured Indenture. The Indenture will provide that from and after the Issue Date, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the assets subject to such Asset Sale; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, if the property or assets sold or otherwise disposed have a fair market value in excess of the greater of $980.0 million and 50.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis) (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that each of the following will be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents for purposes of this clause (2): (a) any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes that (x) are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer) or (y) are otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction with such transferee (other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries) and, in each case, for which the Issuer and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been released; (b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee or in connection with such Asset Sale (including earnouts and similar obligations) that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received) or by ----- their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; (c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale (other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; (d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuers (other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

and (f) any Investment, Capital Stock, assets, property or capital or other expenditure of the kind referred to in clause (2) of the second paragraph in this “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.” Within 540 days after the later of (i) the date of such Asset Sale and (ii) receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale (as may be extended by an Acceptable Commitment or a Second Commitment as set forth below, the “Proceeds Application Period”), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of such Net Proceeds (the “Available Proceeds”) from such Asset Sale: (1) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase: (a) Obligations under a Credit Facility (including the Senior Credit Facilities) or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of clauses (1) through (25) above or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” the Issuer will be entitled to divide, classify and subsequently divide and reclassify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through (25) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in a manner that otherwise complies with this covenant. The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in a Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries. If the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the provisions of the Secured Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Secured Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Issuer’s financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income or EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Issuer for any period.

If the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the provisions of the Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Issuer’s financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income or EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Issuer for any period.

(11) the Secured Indenture will not treat (x) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (y) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors; (12) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock and issue shares of Preferred Stock, if either (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio on a consolidated basis for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00, as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period, or (ii) the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio would have been no greater than 6.50 to 1:00, in each case determined on a _pro forma basis (including a_ _pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom but without giving effect to any_ simultaneous incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1)(b) in the second paragraph of this covenant); provided, _however that, on a pro forma basis, together with any amounts incurred or issued, as applicable, and outstanding by_ Non-Guarantors pursuant to clause 12(b) and (14) of the following paragraph, no more than the greater of $1,955.0 million and 100.0% of LTM EBITDA of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock at any one time outstanding and incurred or issued, as applicable, pursuant to this paragraph shall be incurred or issued, as applicable, by Non-Guarantors; provided, further, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to Indebtedness of any Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition or any other Investment not prohibited by the provisions of the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (or of any Person not previously a Restricted Subsidiary that is merged or consolidated with or into the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) ----- if such Indebtedness is outstanding prior to such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and to the extent such Indebtedness is not incurred in contemplation of such acquisition or Investment.

_provided_ that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollardenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(12) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

and (15)the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The obligations under this covenant may be satisfied by having the applicable entity furnish reports containing the information contemplated hereby to the Holders of the Notes or filed reports containing the information contemplated hereby with the SEC. If the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will include a presentation of selected financial metrics (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries as a group in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee under the Indenture is for informational purposes only and the information and the Trustee’s receipt of the foregoing shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein, or determinable from information contained therein including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants thereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officer’s Certificate). The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze reports delivered to it.

provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Secured Indenture provisions described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 270 days after written notice described in this clause has been given; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed ----- to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the Issue Date, if both: (a) such default either (i) results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or (ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to the greater of $685.0 million and 35.0% of LTM EBITDA or more at any one time outstanding;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary); (7) the Secured Note Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Secured Indenture or the release of any such Secured Note Guarantee in accordance with the Secured Indenture (including the Agreed Security Principles); or (8) (i) the Liens created by the Collateral Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and perfected Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless perfection is not required by the Secured Indenture or the Collateral Documents) other than (A) in accordance with the terms of the relevant Collateral Document or the Secured Indenture, (B) the satisfaction in full of all Obligations under the Secured Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results from the failure of the Notes Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Collateral Documents or (ii) the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any Collateral Document is invalid or unenforceable, and in each case of clause (i) and (ii), such default continues for 30 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes. However, a Default under clause (3), (4) or (5) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes notify the Issuers of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3) and (5), the Issuers do not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (3) or (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuers and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing System”) or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position _Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of_ Default (a “Default Direction”) shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Secured Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is ----- deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuers with such other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Secured Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee and the Relevant Clearing System shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the Issuers determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuers have initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the Issuers provide to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Secured Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Secured Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any liability to the Issuers, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Secured Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuers or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding Secured Notes by written notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on all the then outstanding Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section occurs and is continuing, all outstanding Secured Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Secured Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Secured Notes. Any time period in the Secured Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction. ----- The Secured Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Secured Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Secured Indenture. The Secured Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Secured Notes waive all past or any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Secured Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment of interest or the principal of any Secured Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Secured Notes and its consequences; provided such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Secured Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) Holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Secured Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Secured Notes unless the Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as the case may be, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder of a Secured Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Secured Indenture or the Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Secured Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders of the Secured Notes have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, under the Secured Indenture the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Secured Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Secured Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee shall have no duty to determine whether an action is prejudicial to a minority holder). The Secured Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a statement regarding whether the signer thereof knows of any Default that occurred ----- during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any Default, its status and what actions the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Secured Indenture and such notice references the Secured Notes and the Secured Indenture and states that it is a “notice of default.” The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default with respect to the Notes: (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes; (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes; (3) failure by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 270 days after written notice described in this clause has been given; ----- (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the Issue Date, if both: (a) such default either (i) results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or (ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to the greater of $685.0 million and 35.0% of LTM EBITDA or more at any one time outstanding; (5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final non-appealable judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of $685.0 million and 35.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of amounts covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary); or (7) the Note Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Note Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture (including the Agreed Security Principles). However, a Default under clause (3), (4) or (5) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuers of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3) and (5), the Issuers do not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (3) or (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuers and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default (a “Default Direction”) shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuers with such other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its ----- nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuers have initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers provide to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered the Trustee), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuers, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuers or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section occurs and is continuing, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice.

If any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (2) Holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,239,"BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM",239.1,The USD Global Notes,239.1.2,Depository_** **_Procedures,"The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, ----- trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the USD Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the USD Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the USD Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the USD Global Notes). Investors in the USD Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the USD Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in the USD Global Notes may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in the USD Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the issue date, investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of Euroclear, and Clearstream Banking, S.A., as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a USD Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, beneficial owners of an interest in the USD Global Notes will not have USD notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of dollar notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated USD Notes”) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indentures governing the USD notes for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium and interest on a USD Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture governing the USD notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the USD notes, the applicable issuers and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including the USD Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such USD notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the applicable issuers, the Trustee or any agent of the applicable issuers or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the USD Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the USD Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. ----- DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the USD notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of the USD notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the applicable issuers. Neither the issuers nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any the USD notes, and the applicable issuers and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of USD notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests of the USD Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the USD note as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the dollar notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the USD Global Notes for legended USD notes in certificated form, and to distribute such dollar notes to its Participants. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time. Neither the issuers nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

See “Transfer Restrictions.” Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a USD Regulation S Global Note and a USD Rule 144A Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC Participant through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the USD Regulation S Global Note and the USD Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the USD Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another USD Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such USD Global Note and will become an interest in such other USD Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in such other USD Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The issuers understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their Participants through electronic book entry changes in the accounts of such Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their Participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream Participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream Participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of Participants, who in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Non-USD Book Entry Interests. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Non-USD Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream Participants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The requirement to make any such payments may implicate the provisions of the Treasury Regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments (“CPDIs”).

It is assumed that none of the notes will be issued with an original issue discount equal to or exceeding a de minimis amount. ----- If a U.S. holder receives a payment of interest on a note denominated in euro or sterling and such U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. holder will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the interest (including additional amounts) received on the notes, determined by translating the euro or sterling received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A U.S. holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros or sterling so received. If a U.S. Holder receives a payment of interest on a note denominated in euro or sterling and such U.S. Holder uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or such U.S. holder is otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt), the U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest (including additional amounts) received on the notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, a U.S. holder will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, a U.S. holder may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on (i) the last day of the accrual period, (ii) the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period straddles such U.S. holder’s taxable year, or (iii) the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations that a U.S. holder holds from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the advisability of making the above election. In addition, upon receipt by such a U.S. Holder of an interest payment on a note denominated in euro or sterling (including, upon the sale of a note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), such U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency gain or loss (treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euros or sterling received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income such U.S. Holder previously included in income with respect to such payment.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note will generally be the price paid therefor. Solely with respect to the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes, a U.S. holder’s price paid generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros or sterling paid for such note determined at the spot rate on the date ----- of such purchase. If a U.S. holder’s note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euros or sterling, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros or sterling received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. However, if a U.S. holder is a cash method taxpayer and the notes are traded on an established securities market, euros or sterling paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date (rather than the trade date) of the purchase or sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note generally will be capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if such U.S. holder has held the note for more than one year. Otherwise, such gain or loss will generally be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, may be taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income.

Solely with respect to the euro secured notes and the sterling secured notes, a portion of a U.S. holder’s gain or loss may be treated as foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of such note. Such foreign currency gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the note is the purchase price for the note calculated in euros or sterling on the date of purchase, and the amount of foreign currency gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date the U.S. holder purchased the note.

If the second exception applies, such non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to United States federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate) on any gain recognized on the disposition, which gain may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

We have not sought, and do not expect to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. Moreover, this summary does not address any United States federal non-income (including estate or gift), state, local or non-United States tax considerations, the Medicare tax imposed on certain net investment income or considerations under any applicable tax treaty. This summary applies only to holders (1) that purchase notes in this offering for cash at the initial offering price at which a substantial amount of the notes of the applicable series are sold for cash to persons other than bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers (which is assumed for purposes of this summary to be the initial offering price of the applicable series set forth on the cover page of this offering circular) and (2) that will hold the notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary is general in nature and does not purport to deal with all aspects of United States federal income taxation that might be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal circumstances or status (for example, U.S. holders subject to the alternative minimum tax) or special rules that may apply to certain holders such as: banks and certain other financial institutions; former citizens or residents of the United States; insurance companies; regulated investment companies; brokers, dealers or traders in securities or currencies; “controlled foreign corporations;” “passive foreign investment companies;” corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; partnerships and other pass-through entities and investors in such entities; S corporations; traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings; U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; U.S. holders who hold notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary; tax-exempt entities; persons holding the notes as part of a “straddle,” conversion transaction, integrated transaction, constructive sale transaction, hedge or hedging transaction; persons deemed to sell the notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code; persons purchasing or selling notes as part of a wash sale for tax purposes; entities subject to the anti-inversion rules; taxpayers required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to a note as a result of such income being reported on an applicable financial statement; taxpayers subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax; and taxpayers who are members of an “expanded group” or “modified expanded group” with the issuer within the meaning of Treasury Regulations under section 385 of the Code. In the case of a beneficial owner of notes that is classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, the tax treatment of the purchase, ownership and disposition of notes to a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships considering an investment in the notes and partners therein are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the particular United States federal income tax consequences applicable to them. The following discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. Potential investors considering the purchase of notes are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to them of the purchase, disposition and ownership of notes, as well as any tax consequences arising under any other United States federal tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Accordingly, the entity through which notes are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country, or future Treasury Regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements. Under proposed Treasury regulations that may be relied upon pending finalization, these withholding requirements would generally not apply to gross proceeds from asset dispositions.

Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on January 31, 2020 and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the United Kingdom at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the UK, including the Insolvency Regulation 2000 and the EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2006 (SI 2016/1024) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”). Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the Transition Period, in which case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in a member state of the European Union, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of any English Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border Recognition of English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings'”, below). English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the notes are guaranteed by the guarantees and secured by security interests over the collateral (for the secured notes only). English insolvency ----- laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee against an English Obligor and of the security interests over the collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the guarantees and/or under the collateral securing the secured notes and the related guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Obligor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security. Until floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge. On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency officeholders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”), assets subject to floating charge security are subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors (see “—Priority on Insolvency” below); and (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security. There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that fixed security interests expressed to be created by a security document governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterised as floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,242,LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,242.1,England and Wales,242.1.3,Administration,"English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of any company within their general jurisdiction (see “—Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English Courts” above), any company incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or a member state of the EEA, any company (irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its COMI in the United Kingdom or an EU member state (other than Denmark) and upon request from courts in other parts of the United Kingdom or certain other countries and territories. In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the ----- relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to one or more seemed or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on Insolvency” below). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, the debtor company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as described in “—Qualifying Floating Charge” below) where the floating charge has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court. Different appointment procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business as an agent of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realisation of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “—Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realise their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations. Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter into administration, the guarantees granted by such English Obligors and the related collateral may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator while the relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that the security agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or ----- its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into administration. A floating charge constitutes a qualifying floating charge if it is created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (being paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the the Insolvency Act), (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company, or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security granted to that party, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company, and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The ability to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of a qualifying floating charge where either the security document granting such charge pre-dates 15 September 2003 or where it falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002). The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “—Transactions at an Undervalue”, “—Preference” and “—Voidable Floating Charge” below, respectively).

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration” above). The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor (although the receiver owes the charger a duty to act in good faith during the course of his or her appointment). This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realising the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realisations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). ----- To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realisation of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Prescribed Part” below).",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement, except to the extent that it is under-secured.

This requires a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales (among other matters). An English Obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In practice, the requisite “sufficient connection” has been found to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s COMI is in England and Wales, the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not specific circumstances satisfy the requirement for sufficient connection in any given case.Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or decline to sanction the scheme. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings (although see “—Moratoriums” below).",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The CIGA is intended to improve the ability of companies to be efficiently restructured. ----- The CIGA inserts a new restructuring plan procedure into the Companies Act 2006, under Part 26A. The new procedure is similar to a scheme of arrangement in that it allows the English courts to effect a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors), but with the added possibility of “cross-class cram-down”. While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties. A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed compromise, there is no requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’;(b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’; and (iii) the court considers the plan is just and equitable. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ”cross-class cram-down”, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favour of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes. Following approval of the restructuring plan at the meetings of creditors, the restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether each applicable statutory condition has been satisfied and consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or decline to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies. As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings (although see “—Moratoriums” below).",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act; see “—Administration” above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. ----- The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding- up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the members’ resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding- up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “—Avoidance of Transactions” below). In light of the coronavirus pandemic, legislation has been introduced which temporarily restricts the ability of creditors to present winding-up petitions and of courts to grant winding-up orders. While these measures remain in place, (a) winding-up petitions on the basis of a company’s inability to satisfy a statutory demands alone are void if the relevant statutory demands were served between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, and (b) where winding-up petitions are presented between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021 based on other grounds, the petitioning creditor must show that it had reasonable grounds to believe that coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company or that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the company. Between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, a court may similarly only grant a winding-up order in circumstances where a company is deemed unable to pay its debts and it appears to the court that coronavirus has had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition if the court is satisfied that the company’s insolvency would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,242,LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,242.1,England and Wales,242.1.11,Priority on Insolvency,"One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realise the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors. In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): ----- - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest account for the relevant indebtedness; - _Second ranking: prescribed fees and expenses of the official receiver; - Third ranking: where winding-up procedures are begun within 12 weeks following the end of any (new, stand-alone) moratorium (see further below), unpaid moratorium debts and unpaid priority pre-moratorium debts; - _Fourth ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are-paid); - _Fifth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts are limited to (a) certain categories of bank account deposits, and (b) claims by HMRC in respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally after the ordinary preferential debts and, as between one another, the categories of bank account deposits rank before the HMRC claims; - _Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - _Seventh ranking: firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the notes offered hereby or related guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the notes may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This however ----- does not include “currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme Court Lehman Brothers ruling dated May 17, 2017; and - _Eighth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company's net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the granting of the security and/or guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company. The issuers cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the notes and secured notes offered hereby, as applicable, would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid. _Onset of Insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below). A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company. ----- A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest or guarantee granted by the English Obligors include, without limitation, the following described below: _Transactions at an Undervalue_ Under Section 238 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside a transaction, for example, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief as the court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) where the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the company enters liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date of the relevant transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see “—Connected Persons” above), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preferences_ Under Section 239 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside a transaction, for example, payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief ----- as the court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) where such transaction constituted a preference. A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date of the relevant transaction. A transaction may constitute a preference if a transaction has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company ’ s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, for the court to determine a transaction was a preference, it must be shown that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. _Transactions Defrauding Creditors_ Under Section 423 of the Insolvency Act, where a transaction was at an undervalue and the court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction including the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and use of the provision is therefore not limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no statutory time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Voidable Floating Charges_ ----- Under Section 245 of the Insolvency Act, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year prior to the onset of the company’s insolvency (or two years in the case of a floating charge in favour of a connected person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the goods or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “—Consideration”). The requirement for a company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of granting the floating charge or to become insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration, irrespective of whether the relevant company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant. However, if the floating charge is created or otherwise arises under a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in “—Administration” above. _Recharacterisation of Fixed Charges_ As referred to above (see “—Fixed Versus Floating Charges” above), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterised as a floating charge. If such recharacterisation falls within the suspect period referred to above (see “—Voidable Floating Charges” above), this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the Consideration. _Disclaimer_ An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to an executed contract nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

An equitable charge arises where a charging company creates an encumbrance over the property in favour of the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court. The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account ----- Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and setoff rights unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable.” Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law. _Security Registration_ Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest (the “—Registration Period”). In light of the coronavirus pandemic, the Registration Period has temporarily been extended to 31 days for security interests granted between June 6, 2020 and April 5, 2021 (unless extended further). While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the Registration Period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired. The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets. _Moratoriums_ As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. ----- Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “—Administration” above), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “—Liquidation/Winding-up” above). The CIGA inserts a new stand-alone moratorium into the Insolvency Act to facilitate company restructurings. Entry into a moratorium is similar to the current out-of-court administrator appointment procedure, i.e., filing relevant papers at court (except where the company is subject to an outstanding winding-up petition or is an overseas company, in which case the company must apply to court for the moratorium). The moratorium is subject to the supervision of a licensed insolvency practitioner (the “Monitor”). As a condition to commencement of the moratorium, the company requires confirmation from the Monitor that the company is eligible for the moratorium and that, in the Monitor’s view, it is likely that a moratorium for the company would result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. The moratorium is available to companies that are, or are likely to become, unable to pay their debts. A company is excluded from being eligible for the moratorium if (among other matters): - at any time in the previous 12 months, the company has been subject to a formal insolvency proceeding; or - the company is party to a “capital market arrangement” (including the grant of security or a guarantee) under which a party has incurred a debt of at least £10 million, where the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. The moratorium lasts for an initial period of 20 business days, subject to possible extension. A company subject to a moratorium effectively receives a payment holiday in respect of its pre-moratorium debts, subject to broad exceptions (including debts or liabilities arising under a contract involving financial services). The Monitor must terminate the moratorium if certain circumstances arise, including if the Monitor thinks that the moratorium is no longer likely to result in the rescue of a company as a going concern. If a company enters liquidation within 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium, any unpaid moratorium debts, and certain pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday during the moratorium, will have priority over other claims in the liquidation. Pre-existing financial debts accelerated during the moratorium will not receive such priority, other than in respect of amounts which already fell due during the moratorium. If a company enters administration within 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium, the administrator must make a distribution in respect of any unpaid moratorium debts, and those pre moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday during the moratorium and which are payable in priority over other claims in administration. Any person affected by the moratorium may challenge it on certain grounds, including that of unfair harm, at any time during the moratorium. _Restriction on the Operation and Exercise of Ipso Facto Provisions_ Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant officeholder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. ----- The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act). In light of the coronavirus pandemic, certain small suppliers are also temporarily excluded from the restrictions where the counterparty enters into relevant insolvency procedures prior to 30 June 2021 (unless extended further).",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and the United Kingdom, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain UK insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the United Kingdom) or foreign non-main proceedings (if COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the United Kingdom). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and restructuring plan processes, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 and the Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the United Kingdom’s pending accession to the latter) where these apply. _Recognition in the European Union_ Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the European Union (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the United Kingdom and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognised in other EU member states. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the United Kingdom was a member state of the European Union. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognised and whether investors may adversely affected as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The secured notes will be co-issued by the LuxCo co-issuer, which is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. The Luxembourg Companies Law differs in material aspects from the laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and security holders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, managers, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, security holder lawsuits and indemnification of directors or managers. Under Luxembourg law, the duties of directors or managers of a company are generally owed to the company only; creditors of Luxembourg companies generally do not have rights to take action against directors of the company, except in limited circumstances. Managers of a Luxembourg company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act in good faith and in the interests of the company as a whole and must exercise due care, skill and diligence in the performance of their duties. Directors or managers have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any direct or indirect, personal financial interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a manager of a Luxembourg company is found to have breached his or her duties to such company, he or she may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty. A manager may be jointly and severally liable with other managers implicated in the same breach of duty. Insolvency proceedings with respect to companies incorporated in Luxembourg would likely be governed by the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization. In addition, the Luxembourg Obligors could be required to proceed under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the company has its “centre of main interests,” as defined in Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), at the time insolvency proceedings are commenced. Although there is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interests” will be in the jurisdiction where its registered office is situated, this presumption is not conclusive. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to these companies may proceed under, and be governed by, the insolvency laws of another jurisdiction if the “centre of main interests” of these companies is determined to be in such other jurisdiction at the relevant time. The insolvency laws of such jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as those of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar. If the Luxembourg Obligors or any of their subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. The liabilities of the LuxCo co-issuer in respect of the notes will, in the event of its liquidation following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those of the concerned company’s debts that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others, certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue, value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise, social security contributions, and remuneration owed to employees. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). During insolvency proceedings, unsecured creditors may not bring enforcement measures against the Luxembourg company. The ability of secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited in the event of controlled management proceedings automatically causing the rights of secured creditors to be frozen until a final decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect. Generally, Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by a Luxembourg company during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period, which is a maximum of six months and ten days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular: ----- - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some specific transactions (in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts, the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; and the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; and - article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the civil code gives the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts. The contracts, therefore, survive after the bankruptcy order, but the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts. However, as of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy order provides for a period of time during which creditors must file their claims with the clerk’s office of the Luxembourg district court sitting in commercial matters. After having converted all available assets of the company into cash and after having determined all the company’s liabilities, the insolvency receiver will distribute the proceeds of the sale, on a pro rata basis, to the creditors after deduction of the receiver fees and the bankruptcy administration costs. Insolvency proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the relevant Luxembourg company’s business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations with respect to the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,242,LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,242.2,Luxembourg,242.2.2,Security interests considerations,"The secured notes are secured by several security interests governed by Luxembourg law. According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. A judgment of the European Court of Justice dated 10 November 2016 in Case C 156/15 relating to a pledge over monies deposited to a current account, has held that Directive 2002/47/EC of 6 June 2002 on financial collateral arrangements, confers to the pledgee the right to enforce the collateral, notwithstanding the commencement of insolvency proceedings in respect of the pledgor, only if, (i) the monies covered by the collateral were deposited in the account in question before the commencement of those proceedings or those monies were deposited in the account in question on the day of commencement, the pledgor having proved that it was not aware, nor should have been aware, that those proceedings had commended and (ii) the account holder was prevented from disposing of those monies after they had been deposited in that account. Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge over registered shares in a Luxembourg company must be ----- (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the pledge) and (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge under a receivables pledge agreement will be validly created and perfected provided that the pledge under such receivables pledge agreement is executed by the parties thereto. However, if the debtor has not been notified of such receivables pledge or if it did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, it will be validly discharged of its obligations if it pays the pledgor. A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, without limitation: - the direct appropriation, or appropriation by third parties, of the pledged assets at a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties; - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms (conditions _commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by way of a public auction;_ - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. According to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, with the exception of the provisions of the law of January 8, 2013 on the over-extension of debt, the provisions of Book III, Title XVII of the Luxembourg Civil Code, of Book I, Title VIII and of Book III of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and national or foreign provisions governing reorganisation measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings and attachments are not applicable to financial collateral arrangements and netting agreements and shall not constitute an obstacle to the enforcement and to the performance by the parties of their obligations. Pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, a financial collateral arrangement entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators notwithstanding the suspect period referred to in Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the secured party proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it. According to article 24 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the above protection applies not only to Luxembourg security interests governed by the Luxembourg Collateral Law (such as Luxembourg pledges over or collateral assignments of claims and financial instruments), but extends to foreign law financial collateral arrangements, which are similar to the financial collateral arrangements subject to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, where the collateral giver is located in Luxembourg. Foreign law-governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers or administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security ----- interests or arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any thirdparty creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or unsecured creditors. This includes, in particular, the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the tax authorities and certain assimilated parties (such as social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege may take precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees, applicable corporate procedures normally entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by the decision of delegates that have been appointed by the board of managers or directors of the Luxembourg company for such purpose. In addition, the granting of the envisaged guarantees must comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object. The proposed action by the company must be “in the corporate interest of the company,” which is a translation of the French “intérêt social,” an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and interpreted by court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior.” Whereas the discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of ----- corporate benefit requires a subjective judgment. In a group context, the interest of the companies of the group taken individually is not entirely eliminated. With respect to Guarantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the Luxembourg Companies Law does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group, it is generally held that within a group of companies, in the context of a group of related companies, the existence of a group interest in granting upstream or cross stream assistance under any form (including under the form of guarantee or security) to other group companies could constitute sufficient corporate benefit to enable a Luxembourg company to grant such guarantee, provided that the following conditions are met (and subject in any event to all the factual circumstances of the matter): (i) such guarantee must be given for the purpose of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group, (ii) the commitment to grant such guarantee must not be without consideration and such commitment must not be manifestly disproportionate in view of the obligations entered into by other group companies, and (iii) such guarantee granted or any other financial commitments must not exceed the financial capabilities of the committing company. Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee on a group level is certainly important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate for a lack of corporate interest for one or more of the companies of the group taken individually. The concept of corporate interest is of particular importance in the context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Companies Law. The failure to comply with the corporate interest requirement will typically result in personal liability (civil and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the Guarantor concerned. The guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses addressed by the Luxembourg Companies Law, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted for misuse of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person may be an interested third party, e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In addition, it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse of corporate assets became known to him. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Companies Law will be held null and void. The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case by case basis, and a subjective, fact based judgment is required to be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company. As a result of the above developments, the guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company (in the context of upstream and/or cross stream guarantee(s)) will be subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of general limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres)) increased by its subordinated debts (dettes subordonnées), which is inserted in the relevant finance document(s), indentures or guarantee agreements and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under the guarantee. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Non-U.S. plans, U.S. governmental plans and certain U.S. church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (as discussed below), may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the notes to determine the suitability of the notes for such plan and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations. In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. In addition, a fiduciary should consider the fact that none of the issuers, Investor Group, initial purchasers, or guarantors, or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”), will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold notes and none of the Transaction Parties is undertaking to provide any advice, including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the notes must be made by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arms’ length basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. The purchase and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the purchase and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by ----- independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the abovenoted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering purchasing and/or holding the notes in reliance of these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the notes. Any fiduciary of a governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the notes should consult with its counsel before purchasing notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. Purchasers of the notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws.

These transactions may include over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of such notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes, as applicable. In addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilization Managers to engage in such transactions and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilization Managers will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

LLC are acting as the representatives of the several initial purchasers of the USD notes. Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc are acting as the representatives of the several initial purchasers of the Non-USD notes. Subject to the terms and conditions that will be contained in the purchase agreement among the issuers, the guarantors and the initial purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers have agreed to purchase from us, severally and not jointly, the entire principal amount of each series of notes set forth in the purchase agreement. The obligations of the initial purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to purchase notes from us, are several and not joint. The purchase agreement will provide that the initial purchasers will purchase all of the notes being sold pursuant to the purchase agreement if any of them are purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement will provide that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated. The initial purchasers initially propose to offer the notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover page of this offering circular. After the initial offering, the initial purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that any initial purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The initial purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. In the purchase agreement the issuers and the guarantors will agree that: - The issuers and the guarantors will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any of our debt securities that are substantially similar to the notes issued by or guaranteed by us or the guarantors and having a term of more than one year for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering circular without the prior consent of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC. - The issuers and the guarantors will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other place. In the purchase agreement, each initial purchaser will agree that: - The notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements. - During the initial distribution of the notes, it will offer or sell notes only to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S. In addition, with respect to the notes sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, until 40 days following the closing of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short ----- positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes or cause the price of the notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. Each series of notes constitutes a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for listing of the USD notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the USD notes in any automated dealer quotation system. We have been advised by certain of the secured notes initial purchasers and the unsecured notes initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the secured notes and the unsecured notes, respectively, after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. We will apply, through the listing agent, for the listing of and permission to deal in the non-USD notes on the Official List of the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained. It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about      , 2021, which is the      business day following the date of the pricing of the notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+ , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes during such period should consult their own advisors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY Allied Universal Holdco LLC (“Holdco”) conducts all its operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including, Allied Universal Sideco LLC (“Sideco”), Universal Services of America, LP (“USA LP”) and USA LP’s wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). Holdco is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allied Universal Topco LLC (“Topco”). The Company provides security officer, or manned guarding, services, including specialized security officer services such as vehicle patrol, visitor management, executive protection, K-9 security services, secret and top secret cleared security professionals. In addition, the Company provides comprehensive technology solutions, including video surveillance, closed circuit television (“CCTV”) picture capture and monitoring, robot patrolling, GPS-based patrol and reporting, management of access control points and centralized security operations. The Company offers systems integration services to design, install and service fully-integrated technology-based monitoring systems, along with digital solutions and remote monitoring. The Company also offers ancillary services, including temporary and permanent staffing, event staffing and security, janitorial services, and consulting and investigation solutions. The Company, which was founded in 1965, is co-located in Santa Ana, CA and Conshohocken, PA, and conducts its operations principally through offices across the United States of America and Puerto Rico and has operations in Canada, Latin America and the United Kingdom. On May 2, 2016, Holdco and Topco entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger Agreement (the “Allied Agreement”) with Vigilant Holdings LP (“Vigilant”), then parent company of Allied Security Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Allied”) and an indirect subsidiary of Wendel SE, a European investment firm (the “Allied Transaction”). The closing of the Allied Transaction occurred on August 1, 2016 (“Closing Date”), at which time Vigilant was merged into Holdco with Holdco surviving. As a consequence of the Allied Transaction, Warburg Pincus LLC and Wendel SE held equal ownership interests in Topco, with Partners Group and certain members of Company management also holding ownership interests. On February 20, 2019, the Company announced that Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“CDPQ”), a Canadian institutional investor, agreed to make an investment in Topco, including $208.0 million of primary capital, which was contributed to Holdco. On September 18, 2019, Wendel SE announced that it had reached an agreement with CDPQ and other holders of existing ownership interests in Topco to sell part of its ownership interest in Topco to a new investment group led by Warburg Pincus LLC and an affiliate of the J. Safra Group. These transactions (collectively, the “CDPQ Transaction”) closed on December 12, 2019. Funds exchanged for ownership interest in Topco that occurred at the investor level are not reflected within these consolidated financial statements. As a consequence of the CDPQ Transaction, while CDPQ holds a significant but non-controlling ownership interest in Topco, the new investment group led by Warburg Pincus LLC maintains a controlling interest in Topco, with certain members of Company management also holding ownership interests. On April 29, 2020, Wendel SE sold its remaining ownership interest in Topco to the new investment group led by Warburg Pincus LLC. ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation—The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements present the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Results of operations of businesses acquired are included from their respective dates of acquisition. The Company records the impact of its minority member’s interests in one of its subsidiaries as a non- controlling interest. The non-controlling interest is presented in the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss as an increase or reduction to net income or loss to arrive at the net income or loss attributable to the Company. The non-controlling interest is also shown as a separate line item in member’s capital in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the Company’s previously reported financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Estimates—Management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Actual results could differ from those estimates. COVID-19—The Company continues to closely monitor developments related to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic to assess any potential impact on its business. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance will depend, in large part, on the effect on its workforce, clients and vendors, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be predicted. In March and early April 2020, the Company experienced a mid-single digit percent reduction in billable service hours from its pre-COVID-19 period of January and February. However, hours stabilized beginning in late April, with hours increasing such that by the fourth quarter of 2020, hours were closer to January and February levels, but hours remained slightly down compared to 2019. The Company has also seen growth in margins, particularly during the second and third quarters of 2020, which offset the impact of the loss of hours, mainly as a result of an increase in premium services, lower overtime, reduced security professional turnover and reduced travel. Additionally, during March 2020, the Company borrowed $500.0 million under the ABL Credit Facility out of an abundance of caution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. After not using any of the additional cash provided by this borrowing, the Company repaid the $500.0 million in full during August 2020. While the Company currently does not anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a materially adverse impact on its business, as a result of the evolving and highly uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, no assurance may be made regarding potential exposure or the indirect effects of the outbreak on the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. On March 27, 2020, the U.S government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which, among other things, contains numerous income tax provisions. The CARES Act allows the Company to defer the payment of the employer share of social security taxes for ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) the period beginning March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Based on the CARES Act, the Company deferred $282.0 million of qualified payroll tax payments as of December 31, 2020, of which, $141.0 million is recorded within accrued payroll and related taxes and $141.0 million is recorded within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The current portion of this liability is due by December 31, 2021 with the remainder due by December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company was able to deduct additional Section 163(j) interest carryforward amounts as a result of the increase in the limitation provided by the CARES Act. The Company will continue to monitor future guidance issued regarding the CARES Act to determine any future impacts. On December 27, 2020, The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”) was signed into law. The CAA clarifies and expands the Paycheck Protection Program loans and the Employee Retention Credit as well as several other tax provisions first outlined in the CARES Act. The CAA is currently being evaluated, however, the Company does not anticipate a material impact as a result of this legislation. Revenue Recognition—In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company accounts for a customer contract when both parties have approved the arrangement, the performance obligations can be identified, payment terms can be determined and it is probable the Company will collect substantially all of the consideration to which it is entitled. The Company recognizes revenue when its performance obligation is satisfied upon the transfer of control of the promised product or service to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. Revenue is recognized over time in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of the Company's contractual relationships with its clients. The Company primarily accounts for its performance obligation under the series guidance and applies the invoice practical expedient to record revenue as services are provided, given the nature of the services provided and the frequency of billing under the customer contracts. By applying the invoice practical expedient, the Company recognizes revenue in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date and for which the Company has the right to invoice the customer. The Company generally bills its customers either in advance, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. Manned guarding service revenue is generally measured based on the billable hours served by security officers and the rate per billable hour, as determined by the underlying customer contract. Janitorial and other ancillary service revenue is recognized in the month services are performed. Advance payments of $9.2 million and $9.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represent amounts received from customers in advance of performing the related services and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The underlying revenue is recognized when the Company performs the related service. Unbilled services rendered represent revenue that has been earned, but has not yet been invoiced. The Company reports revenue net of sales tax collected from customers that are then remitted to government taxing authorities. Taxes collected are recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the applicable government taxing authority. Revenues from video and alarm monitoring and security systems service and installation contracts are recorded as control is transferred to the Company’s clients over time, as any assets created or enhanced by the Company’s performance are controlled by the Company’s clients, there are no alternative uses for any assets created, and the Company has a legally enforceable right to payment for performance completed. Revenue is recognized using the cost-to-cost input method, which measures the percentage of total cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for each contract. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $9.7 million and $13.2 million, respectively, in prepaid and other current ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) assets for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts-in-progress and $9.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on contracts-in-progress. Restricted Cash—The Company has balances on deposit with the Company’s insurance carriers to pay workers’ compensation claims and general liability insurance claims as they become due and an account designated for the benefit of employees, which is reserved expressly for non-comingled uniform deposit funds. Amounts in these accounts are reflected as restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts—Accounts receivable, net are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company has recorded allowances in the amount of $34.6 million and $26.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: (1) customer creditworthiness, (2) aging of accounts receivable, (3) past transaction history with the customer, (4) current economic industry trends and (5) changes in customer payment terms. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, the Company would provide additional allowances. Based on management’s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a reduction to customer accounts receivable. Inventories—Inventories consist principally of purchased parts of security equipment for installation and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventories amounted to $3.7 million and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Income Taxes—The majority of the Company is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. As a result, its members report their share of the Company’s income or loss which has been allocated to the members under the respective membership agreements between Holdco and its subsidiaries or among its subsidiaries on their respective income tax returns. The membership agreements of the Company have provisions requiring the distribution of funds to the members in amounts sufficient for the members to satisfy their federal, state, and local tax obligations with respect to their share of Company income, subject to board approval. Within the Company’s financial reporting structure, several of the operating or holding company entities are treated as corporations for federal and state income tax purposes. The consolidated financial statements reflect a tax provision or benefit for the income taxes associated with these entities and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, where appropriate, related to differences between the accounting and tax treatment of items related to these entities. Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of a recorded deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount sufficient to reduce that deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) Under the terms of the various membership agreements between entities within the Company’s financial reporting structure, the allocation of profits or losses from operating entities to the corporate members varies based on the results of operations for the year. Amounts allocated to corporate members could be material in any given year and result in material amounts of current or deferred income tax expense or benefit to be reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect a tax provision for these corporate taxes plus taxes imposed on the Company’s operating entities which are primarily minimum tax payments plus fees based on the annual gross receipts of the particular reporting entity. Property and Equipment—Property and equipment, including assets under capital lease, are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of each asset. Leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life. In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company reviews its long- lived assets for impairment on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the expected undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate, utilizing management’s best estimates, appropriate assumptions, and projections at the time of review. If the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows, the asset is deemed impaired, and an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair market value of the asset. No impairment was identified or recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets—The Company records goodwill as the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the net of the fair values assigned to identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, the Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually at October 1. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general conditions and industry and market conditions, changes in the products/services and regulatory and political developments, cost of doing business, overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods, other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation, and events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company would perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test as required. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then no further testing is required. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the Company would record an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill recorded. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit based on a combination of significant observable and unobservable inputs, including estimates of future operating performance. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) reporting unit is less than its carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. The Company’s trade names have been determined to be indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets and therefore are not amortized. The Company’s finite-lived identifiable intangible assets, such as customer contracts, non-compete agreements and technology are amortized over their estimated economic lives on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For our indefinite- lived trade names, the Company also conducts an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the trade names is less than their carrying value, the Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived trade names using the relief from royalty method. The relief from royalty method measures the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such intangible assets and not having to pay a royalty for their use. Impairment would then be recognized for the difference between the determined fair value and their carrying value, if applicable. Management performs the trade name impairment test annually at October 1, regardless of the results of the goodwill evaluation. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of indefinite-lived trade names are less than their carrying values. There were no impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. Marketable Securities—The Company’s investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings and are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a component of interest expense, net. All of the Company’s marketable securities are classified as long-term because they support the long-term Supplemental Income Plan (“SIP”) liability and long-term deferred compensation plan liability assumed as part of the acquisition of U.S. Security Associates, Inc. (“USSA”) and include investments that do not have contractual maturities due to the nature of the investment vehicles. Marketable securities consist principally of mutual funds invested in United States of America equity securities, government securities and money market funds. Unrealized gains on marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $4.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair values of the Company’s marketable securities are $51.4 million and $37.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included with deposits and other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Concentrations of Credit Risk—Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and trade accounts receivable that are not collateralized. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited since the Company’s revenue base is composed of a large number of customers that are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, no customer represented greater than 10.0% of total accounts receivable or revenue. Cash accounts at each financial institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250 thousand. The Company routinely maintains cash at several financial institutions in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash. ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) Fair Value Measurements—The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. The Company determines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the fair value hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company applies both a market approach and income approach to determine fair value. The market approach uses pricing and other information generated by market transactions for identical or comparable assets and liabilities. The income approach seeks to identify future cash flows to be generated and compare them with a required rate of return. Assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level (least observable) input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined based on management’s assessment of available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, such as cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and various accrued expenses, approximates their fair value based on the short-term maturities of these instruments. The estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $51.4 million and $37.9 million, respectively, based on quoted market prices (Level 1). The estimated fair values of the Company’s debt instruments are estimated using current market pricing quotes (Level 2). At December 31, 2020, the estimated fair values of the Company’s first lien term loan, senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes are approximately $2,187.4 million, $2,070.5 million and $1,142.0 million, respectively, as compared to their carrying values, exclusive of discounts, premiums and related fees, of $2,197.8 million, $1,940.0 million and $1,050.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019, the estimated fair values of the Company’s first lien term loan, senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes were approximately $2,241.2 million, $1,075.6 million and $1,126.2 million, respectively, as compared to their carrying values, exclusive of discounts and related fees, of $2,220.0 million, $1,000.0 million and $1,050.0 million, respectively. Insurance Reserves—The Company maintains insurance coverage, subject to certain self-insured retention limits, for workers’ compensation, general liability, employment practices liability, automobile liability and healthcare claims. Medical benefit costs for the majority of the Company’s workforce are premium-based. Costs associated with the premium-based plans equal the actual premiums paid and premiums can fluctuate. Conversely, for administrative employees and security officers not subject to premium-based coverage, the Company is self-insured and subject to self-insured retention limits. The Company records its reserves for workers’ compensation, general liability, employment practices liability and automobile liability based on a third-party actuarial analysis which includes amounts adequate to cover the ultimate claim, incurred but not reported development risk and litigation defense costs. Estimates of the ultimate cost of claims are derived from the level of the Company’s insurance coverage and the Company’s retained risk of loss. The Company records a reserve for healthcare claims based upon a third-party lag study analysis. Management reviews these estimates on a quarterly basis subject to information then currently available to assess their adequacy and the propriety of disclosure. The Company adjusts the reserves, if needed, based on the results of management’s review. Assessing ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) the adequacy of these reserves is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates. Leases—The Company’s facilities and certain vehicles, equipment, and uniforms are leased and accounted for under the provisions of ASC Topic 840, Leases, and subsequent amendments, which require that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes. The lease term begins when the Company has the right to control the use of the property, which is typically before rent payments are due under the lease agreement. Certain facility leases contain rent escalation clauses, which are recorded on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease with the difference between actual rent payments and the straight-line rent expense recorded as a deferred rent liability. In addition, the Company has financed certain uniforms and vehicles through capital lease arrangements and has assumed capital lease obligations. The current portion of capital lease obligations is included in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, current portion, and the non-current portion of capital lease obligations is included in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, net of current portion, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized lease assets are amortized over the shorter of the economic useful life of the asset or the lease term. Purchase Price Payable—As part of certain completed acquisitions, the Company has agreed to pay cash to the sellers based upon achievement of certain targets after the acquisition date. The Company evaluates the fair value of contingent consideration throughout the year and every reporting period. Changes in the fair value during the measurement period that pertain to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are recorded as measurement period adjustments to goodwill. Changes in the fair value resulting from events that occurred after the acquisition date are recorded as a gain or loss on changes in fair value of the contingent purchase consideration in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $16.3 million and $30.5 million, respectively, is reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $0 and $7.1 million, respectively, is reported in other liabilities for purchase price payable. Member’s Equity Unit-Based Compensation—The Company’s management incentive plans allow the Company to attract and retain employees by allowing them to retain an equity interest in and participate in the long-term growth and financial success of the Company. The Company accounts for its equity unit-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Under ASC Topic 718, equity unit-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the equity award and are recognized in the statements of operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The Company determines the grant-date fair value of equity unit awards using an appropriate option-pricing method. The Company recognizes the equity unit-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award and presents such expense as a separate line item under operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses an independent valuation advisor to assist with determining equity unit valuations for calculating equity unit-based compensation. The Company considers both the historical volatility of its peer group’s stock price, as well as implied volatilities from exchange-traded options on its peer group’s equity units, as applicable. The expected term used by the Company represents the period that the Company’s equity units are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method described in ASC Topic 718-10-30. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity unit-based awards represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, equity unit-based compensation could materially differ in the future. New Accounting Pronouncements—Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), was issued in February 2016. ASU 2016-02 provides for a comprehensive change to lease accounting. The new standard requires that a lessee recognize a lease obligation liability and a right to use an asset for virtually all leases of property, plant, and equipment, subsequently amortized over the lease term. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases: Targeted Improvements, (“ASU 2018-11”), which allows entities the option to adopt this standard prospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening equity and include required disclosures for prior periods. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Effective Dates, (“ASU 2019-10”), which amended the effective date of ASU 2016-02 and related amendments. In June 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-05 to provide nonpublic entities with an option to defer the adoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases, from annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has elected this optional deferral period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 and related amendments on its consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. While the Company has not yet determined the ultimate impact, it anticipates that ASU 2016-02 and related amendments will have a material impact on its financial position by increasing the Company’s assets and liabilities through the recognition of right-of- use assets and lease liabilities for its operating leases. ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), was issued in June 2016 to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods therein. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13, the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2017-04”), was issued in January 2017. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 also eliminates the requirement for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment. ASU 2017-04 should be applied on a prospective basis. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which amended the effective date of ASU 2017-04. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04 during the year ended December 31, 2020, and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations or financial position. ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-07”), was issued in June 2018 and supersedes the guidance in Subtopic 505-50, Equity-Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. In particular, ASU 2018-07 expands the scope of topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (which previously only included payments to employees), to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. An entity should now apply the requirements of Topic 718 to non- employee awards, except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (i.e., the period of time over which share-based payment awards vest and the pattern of cost recognition over that period). Additionally, the amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share- based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in the grantor’s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards, and clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer, or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2018-07 during the year ended December 31, 2020 and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), was issued in August 2018 and modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. Specifically, the amendments remove disclosure requirements in Topic 820 related to (1) the amount of, and reasons for, transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; (2) the policy for timing of transfers between levels; (3) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2018-13 during the year ended December 31, 2020 and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations or financial position. ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”), was issued in August 2018 and requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement, if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing arrangement under the internal-use software guidance in ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. ASU 2018-15 requires a customer to disclose the nature of its hosting arrangements that are service contracts and provide disclosures as if the deferred implementation costs were a separate, major depreciable asset class. ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2018-15 on its consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations and financial position. ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”) was issued in December 2019 and simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statement disclosures, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. ASU No. 2020-04, (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”), was issued in March 2020 to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is elective and applies to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 was subject to election as of March 20, 2020 and can be elected for both interim and annual periods through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-04 on its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 3.

Business Insurance Risks (Workers’ Compensation, General Liability, Employment Practices Liability, Automobile Liability and certain Healthcare Claims) and Tax Assessment Risk In the normal course of operations, various legal claims are filed against the Company for which the Company maintains insurance coverage. The Company has established reserves for these claims based on insurance coverage, the risk of loss retained by the Company and management's judgment. Management does not expect the ultimate outcome of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company maintains insurance coverage, subject to certain self-insured retentions, for workers’ compensation, general liability, employment practices liability, automobile liability and certain healthcare claims. The Company reserves for all known claims and those claims that management believes have been “incurred but not reported” as of the balance sheet date based on its estimate of the ultimate cost of the claims. Management derives the estimated ultimate cost of claims from the level of the Company’s insurance coverage, its retained risk of loss, historical trends and judgment. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the accrued provision for estimated claims, excluding certain healthcare claims was $351.7 million and $314.8 million, respectively, of which $96.9 million and $90.6 million, respectively, is included in accrued claims reserves, current portion and $254.8 million and $224.2 million, respectively, is included in accrued claims reserves, net of current portion within long- term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. On October 21, 2020, Security Casualty Risk Retention Group, Inc. (the “RRG”) was created and incorporated in the state of South Carolina. The RRG is designed to provide an alternative to the historical commercial insurance coverage for general liability and is directly or indirectly owned by the subsidiaries of the Company, all of which are also policy holders. The RRG is effective for selected claims originating as of and subsequent to January 1, 2021, and therefore, the RRG has no impact on the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) In the normal course of business, the Company is audited by taxing authorities and from time to time, receives proposed tax assessments as a result of those audits. The Company records obligations for those proposed tax assessments or portion thereof that management believes are probable of payment and estimable. Management believes that even if any one or more proposed assessment resulted in an unfavorable outcome, they would not be material to the Company’s financial position individually or in the aggregate.

INCOME TAXES Income Tax Expense (Benefit) The Company’s expense (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following: **2020** **2019** Current provision: U.S. Federal $       34,960 $        5,076 U.S. State 23,147 8,925 Foreign 797 4 Total current provision 58,904 14,005 Deferred benefit: U.S. Federal (26,429) (16,714) U.S. State (12,493) (881) Total deferred benefit (38,922) (17,595) Total expense (benefit) for income taxes $       19,982 $       (3,590) #### The reconciliation between the federal statutory tax rate applied to income before taxes and the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is summarized as follows: **2020** **2019** Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % Partnership loss not subject to corporate taxation (45.1)% (20.1)% State taxes, net of federal benefit (16.4)% (0.3)% Tax credits and other 4.3 % 0.8 % Change in tax rates 5.1 % (0.4)% Effective tax rate (31.1)% 1.0 % #### Deferred Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: **2020** **2019** Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $        6,257 $        2,320 Tax credit carryforwards 14,370 16,351 Interest expense limitation 2,932 13,988 Compensation accruals 26,319 21,426 Legal accruals 4,985 2,788 Other deferred tax assets 22,861 7,913 Deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 77,724 64,786 Valuation allowance (933) (1,295) Deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance 76,791 63,491 Deferred tax liabilities: Basis differences related to partnership investments (172,264) (193,661) Amortization (109,663) (165,504) Other deferred tax liabilities (5,327) (4,357) Deferred tax liabilities (287,254) (363,522) Total deferred taxes $     (210,463) $     (300,031) #### On March 27, 2020, the U.S government enacted the CARES Act. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which, among other things, contains numerous income tax provisions. The CARES Act allows the Company to defer the payment of the employer share of social security taxes for the period beginning March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Based on the CARES Act, the Company deferred $282.0 million of qualified payroll tax payments as of December 31, 2020, of which, $141.0 million is recorded within accrued payroll and related taxes and $141.0 million is recorded within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The current portion of this liability is due by December 31, 2021 with the remainder due by December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company was able to deduct additional Section 163(j) interest carryforward amounts as a result of the increase in the limitation provided by the CARES Act. The Company will continue to monitor future guidance issued regarding the CARES Act to determine any future impacts. On December 27, 2020, The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”) was signed into law. The CAA clarifies and expands the Paycheck Protection Program loans and the Employee Retention Credit as well as several other tax provisions first outlined in the CARES Act. The CAA is currently being evaluated, however, the Company does not anticipate a material impact as a result of this legislation. The Company’s largest deferred tax liability relates to amounts ascribed to the value of stock in corporate subsidiaries where the underlying assets and liabilities of the corporation (primarily, partnership interests holding intangible assets, including goodwill) have been revalued under GAAP but not for tax purposes. The remaining deferred tax liability substantially relates to the difference in fair value and net tax value of intangibles created when the Company acquired USSA and SOS (See Note 10). ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) Operating Loss and Tax Credit Carryforwards At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s operating subsidiaries had net operating loss carry- forwards of approximately $43.1 million and $24.8 million, respectively, in various jurisdictions. The Company’s net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. The Company also has tax credit carry- forwards available to offset future tax liabilities of approximately $14.4 million and $16.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which have various expiration dates but begin to expire in 2035. Valuation Allowance Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of a recorded deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount sufficient to reduce that deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. Management believes that future results will be sufficient to realize the Company’s deferred tax assets with the exception of certain foreign tax credits (“FTC”) which were generated pre-acquisition by USSA. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, a valuation allowance of $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, has been established against federal deferred tax assets related to these FTCs. Based on available evidence, including management projections, the Company does not expect to be able to utilize the FTCs in future years. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company files U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax returns. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are in accordance with the accounting standard, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Tax returns for years beginning in 2016 are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and various tax authorities. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed annually with guidance provided in ASC 740 for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that directly or indirectly affect amounts reported in financial statements. ASC 740 also provides accounting guidance for the related income tax effects of individual tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds required in order for any part of the benefit of that tax position to be recognized in an entity’s financial statements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, a total of $0 and $0.4 million, respectively, was reserved on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to uncertain tax positions. 14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company is party to an Investor Management Agreement with certain funds and vehicles affiliated with Warburg Pincus LLC pursuant to which the Company receives certain administrative and management services. In exchange for these services, the Company incurred management fee expense of $6.8 million and $5.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) 15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company has evaluated subsequent events through February 26, 2021, the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. On January 5, 2021, the Company published an offer document regarding its previously announced agreement with the board of directors of G4S plc (“G4S”) on a recommended cash offer to acquire the issued and outstanding shares of G4S, an international provider of security services, for 245 pence in cash for each share of G4S, representing a total value of all share capital of G4S of approximately £3.8 billion. The transaction is expected to close in April 2021, subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permitted) of certain conditions, including valid acceptance of the transaction by holders of 75% (or such lesser percentage as the Company may decide) of G4S shares, and the completion of certain regulatory approval and clearance processes. On January 16, 2021, the Company completed a purchase of the outstanding equity interests in SecurAmerica, LLC, SecurAmerica Corporation and ERMC LLC (collectively, “SecurAmerica”) for a preliminary purchase price subject to certain post-closing adjustments of approximately $352 million. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, SecurAmerica is a provider of security, asset protection and janitorial services with offices located throughout the United States. In connection with the purchase of SecurAmerica, the Company also deposited $31.5 million into an escrow account to fund the future purchase of substantially all of the assets of SecurAmerica TN LLC and ERMC TN LLC (collectively, “SecurAmerica TN”). Also based in Atlanta, Georgia, SecurAmerica TN is a provider of security and janitorial services. The transaction is expected to close during 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. ----- INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC For the year ended 31 December 2020",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes were issued in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Holders of the Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes are not entitled to any registration rights and the Secured Indenture and Unsecured Indenture are not qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.

During March 2020, the Company borrowed $500.0 million under the ABL Credit Facility out of an abundance of caution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. After not using any of the additional cash provided by this borrowing, the Company repaid the $500.0 million in full during August 2020. ----- #### NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED) On July 15, 2020, the Company issued an additional $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes under the Secured Indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the Trustee and as the Notes Collateral Agent.

As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of LoCs pledged against the Revolving Credit Facility and ABL Credit Facility was $0 and $142.9 million, respectively.

We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to but were not limited to compliance with competition laws, payroll laws and regulations, foreign ownership rules and tax laws and regulations, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls) and determined that the principal risks were related to posting of inappropriate journal entries to manipulate financial results and potential management bias in accounting estimates. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or component auditors included: - Discussions with management, internal audit, group general counsel, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non compliance with laws and regulations and fraud; - Assessment of matters reported on the group’s whistleblowing helpline and results of management’s investigation of such matters; - Challenging assumptions made by management in their significant accounting estimates, including onerous contract provisions, carrying value of goodwill, the recognition and measurement of litigation provisions and contingent liabilities, uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets and the valuation of the defined benefit obligations (see related key audit matters below); and ----- INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC For the year ended 31 December 2020 - Testing of material journal entries and post-close adjustments, including the testing of unusual account combinations and consolidation journals. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,248,NONCASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES:,248.17,Key audit matters,248.17.1,,"Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. Disposal accounting and going concern risk arising from change of control are new key audit matters this year and provision for material litigation has replaced the previous key audit matter on non compliance with laws and regulations - specifically in relation to the SFO investigation and compliance with payroll laws and regulations in India and the US. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year. |Key audit matter|How our audit addressed the key audit matter| |---|---| |Goodwill impairment (group) Refer to Audit Committee report on page 36 and to note 16 of the group financial statements. The group has £1.3bn of goodwill at 31 December 2020 (2019: £1.4bn). An impairment charge of £58m has been recorded in 2020 (2019: £291m). Management determines the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (“CGU”) as the higher of value in use (“VIU”) or fair value less cost of disposal (“FVLCD”). The group has over 100 CGUs. The carrying value of goodwill is contingent on future cash flows and there is risk if these cash flows do not meet the group’s expectations that the assets will be impaired. The impairment reviews performed by the group contain a number of significant assumptions including revenue growth, profit margins, cash conversion and long-term growth and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the headroom available in the impairment calculations.|We assessed the mathematical accuracy of management’s goodwill impairment model and agreed the underlying forecasts to board approved budgets and strategic plans and assessed how these budgets were compiled. We identified a sample of CGUs for testing based on the materiality of the goodwill balance, where limited headroom was identified in management’s cash flow model or where the CGU was identified to be at risk due to known performance or macroeconomic conditions. For each CGU selected for testing we critically assessed management’s forecasts by comparing forecast growth to historical growth or actual performance, applying sensitivities to future cash flows and assessing long term growth assumptions against IMF projections. We considered the reliability of management’s forecasting for revenue, profit and cash conversion by comparing budgeted results to actual performance over a period of three years. Where we identified significant shortfalls against budget in prior years, this informed our determination of sensitivities to apply as we formed our independent view about reasonable downside scenarios. With the support of our valuations experts, we assessed the long-term growth rates and discount rates applied by management by reference to third party information and confirmed whether they fell within a reasonable range of external market data. Where they did not, we applied our independent view of a more appropriate rate to management’s forecast. Where the recoverable amount has been assessed with reference to a valuation multiple, we assessed the appropriateness of the multiple by comparison to recent business disposals and to other third party information, with the support of our valuations experts. For those CGUs with low headroom, we performed our own sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes in the assumptions on the available headroom.| ----- INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC For the year ended 31 December 2020 |Col1|The recoverable amounts of a number of CGUs including UK Facilities Management, Estonia Secure Solutions, Brazil Secure Solutions, Indonesia Secure Solutions, Chile Secure Services, Greece Cash Solutions, Global Risk Management and UK Islands Cash Solutions, were found to be sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions and we satisfied ourselves that this risk was appropriately highlighted in the disclosures in note 16. As a result of our work, we were satisfied that, in the context of the group financial statements taken as a whole, it was appropriate to recognise an impairment charge of £58m and considered that adequate disclosure has been made.| |---|---| |Onerous contract provisioning (group) Refer to Audit Committee report on page 36 and to note 30 of the group financial statements. Certain of the group’s contracts are long-term in nature. These contracts can be complex and incorporate penalty and key performance indicator (“KPI”) clauses in the event of non- compliance. The group is therefore required to make operational and financial assumptions to estimate future losses over periods that can extend beyond 10 years. Variability of contract penalties, underlying delivery costs and customer and subcontractor claims or disputes can put additional pressure on margins and on future contract profitability, giving rise to onerous contract provisions. The prediction of future events over extended periods contains inherent risk and the outcome of customer and sub-contractor claims is uncertain and involves a high degree of management estimation. The group has onerous contract provisions at 31 December 2020 of £21m (2019: £21m) and the net income statement charge for onerous contracts in 2020 amounts to £7m (2019 credit: £1m).|Our approach to testing complex contracts started with an evaluation of management’s process to identify and quantify onerous and at-risk contracts. Management focused on the top 25 contracts by region and on contracts with margins of less than 3%. We targeted these higher risk and larger contracts and performed scanning analytics on contract margins to identify unusual or unexpected trends. This enabled us to form an independent view as to whether management’s process had identified all onerous and problematic contracts. Having examined management’s assessment, our procedures focused on the Facilities Management business in the UK. This specifically included three PFI contracts, all of which are long-term in nature. Each of these contracts is particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions and have seen changes in provisioning levels over the last year. For each contract in our sample, we obtained and read the key contractual terms in order to ensure that revenue was recognised in accordance with these terms and that it is supported by evidence of service delivery. We read and understood the contract penalty clauses and evaluated the completeness of penalties through discussions with contract managers and reading minutes of meetings between G4S and the customer, and customer correspondence. We assessed each of the key assumptions underpinning management’s forecasts to quantify onerous contract provisions and independently sensitised management's model. We particularly considered the appropriateness of future forecasts based on past performance. We challenged any forecast cost savings and benefits of performance improvement plans by assessing evidence of their achievability, the extent to which these plans are within the group's direct control and verified any observable benefits achieved to date. We also considered alternative scenarios, inspected correspondence with counterparties and other sources, held discussions with in-house legal counsel, and read appropriate documentation to evaluate contractual claims and disputes with customers and subcontractors. We tested the appropriateness of the discount rate used to determine the present value of the provisions, ensuring that the rates used were appropriate for the risks included in the underlying cash flows. We also assessed the recoverability of dedicated contract assets, assessing the level of impairment recorded where the contract was identified as onerous. We considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable in the context of the group financial statements taken as a whole. However, we noted that the assumptions and judgments that are required to formulate the provisions mean that the range of possible outcomes is broad. We are satisfied with the group’s related disclosures of these| ----- INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC For the year ended 31 December 2020 |Col1|onerous contracts in light of the underlying assumptions and accounting judgments made.| |---|---| |Uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets (group) Refer to Audit Committee report on page 37 and to notes 11 and 31 of the group financial statements. The group operates in a complex multinational tax environment and is subject to a range of tax risks during the normal course of business including transaction related tax matters and transfer pricing arrangements. Where the amount of tax payable is uncertain, the group establishes provisions based on management’s judgment of the most likely amount or based on the expected value, being the sum of the probability weighted amounts in a range of outcomes, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. At 31 December 2020, the group has recognised provisions of £31m related to uncertain tax positions (2019: £33m). In addition, the group has recognised £232m of deferred tax assets at 31 December 2020 (2019: £254m). The recognition of deferred tax assets involves judgement by management regarding the likelihood of the realisation of these assets. The expectation that these assets will be realised is dependent on a number of factors, including whether there will be sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support utilisation of these assets.|With the assistance of our local and international tax specialists, we evaluated and challenged management’s judgements in respect of estimates of tax exposures and contingencies in order to assess the adequacy of the group’s tax provisions. In understanding and evaluating management’s judgements, we considered the status of recent and current tax authority audits and enquiries, judgemental positions taken in tax returns and current year estimates, and developments in the tax environment. Where appropriate, we also read relevant documentation, including opinions from external legal counsel, to understand the legal positions reached. From the evidence obtained, we considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable in the context of the group financial statements taken as a whole. However, we noted that the assumptions and judgements that are required to formulate the provisions mean that there is a broad range of possible outcomes. We are satisfied that these judgements are adequately disclosed in note 11. In respect of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we evaluated management’s assessment of how these assets will be realised and whether there will be sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support their recognition. We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they were prepared, ensuring consistency of cash flows with those used for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. Based on our procedures, future cash flow forecasts supported the recoverability of the deferred tax assets recognised.| |Provision for material litigation (group) Refer to Audit Committee report on page 37 and to note 30 of the group financial statements. The group is currently the subject of a Competition Authority investigation in both Belgium and the US which may result in a material penalty and reputational damage. There are also a number of other ongoing claims with potentially material exposures. There is inherent judgement associated both with assessing and quantifying probable outcomes in relation to ongoing claims and with determining any exposure (and the need for provision) in areas where legal requirements are open to interpretation. In addition, possible outcomes need to be considered for disclosure as contingent liabilities. Unexpected adverse outcomes could materially impact the group’s financial performance and financial position.|We met with the directors, management and in-house legal counsel and obtained correspondence from the group’s external legal advisors to assess the probable outcomes in relation to ongoing claims and exposures. We obtained and reviewed management’s database tracking all litigations and reconciled this to the provisions recorded in order to check for completeness of provisions and contingent liabilities. In relation to the Competition authority investigation management obtained two independent legal opinions in order to understand the range of possible outcomes and we held discussions with both lawyers in order to understand the basis for the calculations and the basis for the assumptions that had been made. From the evidence obtained, we were satisfied with: (i) the adequacy of the group’s provisions made at 31 December 2020 for the risks identified in the context of the group financial statements taken as a whole; and (ii) the appropriateness of the contingent liability disclosures given the status, materiality and likely outcome of claims and exposures in areas where legal requirements are open to interpretation.| ----- INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC For the year ended 31 December 2020 _Disposal accounting (group) Refer to note 15 of the group financial statements._ The sale of the traditional cash businesses to Brinks has resulted in the group recording a material gain on disposal for the year ending 31 December 2020. Given the complexity of the agreement over multiple territories the transaction has been completed in stages. In addition, the results of disposed businesses were therefore included within the group consolidation for differing periods up until the date of disposal for each tranche. _Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities (group) Refer to note 29 of the group financial statements._ The group has UK defined benefit obligations of £2.9bn at 31 December 2020 (2019: £2.7bn), which is significant in the context of the overall balance sheet. The valuation of pension plan liabilities requires estimation in determining appropriate assumptions such as salary increases, mortality rates, discount rates and inflation levels. Movement in these assumptions can have a material impact on the determination of the liability. Management uses external actuaries to assist in determining these assumptions. _Income statement presentation (group)_ |Disposal accounting (group) Refer to note 15 of the group financial statements. The sale of the traditional cash businesses to Brinks has resulted in the group recording a material gain on disposal for the year ending 31 December 2020. Given the complexity of the agreement over multiple territories the transaction has been completed in stages. In addition, the results of disposed businesses were therefore included within the group consolidation for differing periods up until the date of disposal for each tranche.|We have reviewed the signed Share Purchase Agreements (SPA’s), referencing both the disposal proceeds and the terms of any deferred contingent consideration receivable. We have verified the cash proceeds back to source documents, including any subsequent true-ups. We have verified the net asset balances disposed for each tranche back to underlying consolidation schedules and are satisfied that they have been appropriately deconsolidated. Based on the disposal proceeds and net asset balances we have recalculated the profit on disposal, also taking into account the relevant recycling of any CTA balances. We also assessed the recoverability of receivables in relation to deferred consideration with reference to the profitability of the related disposed entity. As a result of our work, we are satisfied that the profit on disposal is correctly recorded and consider the disclosures in note 15 of the group financial statements to be appropriate.| |---|---| |Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities (group) Refer to note 29 of the group financial statements. The group has UK defined benefit obligations of £2.9bn at 31 December 2020 (2019: £2.7bn), which is significant in the context of the overall balance sheet. The valuation of pension plan liabilities requires estimation in determining appropriate assumptions such as salary increases, mortality rates, discount rates and inflation levels. Movement in these assumptions can have a material impact on the determination of the liability. Management uses external actuaries to assist in determining these assumptions.|We used our actuarial experts to assess whether the assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit liabilities for the UK were reasonable. We assessed whether salary increases and mortality rate assumptions were consistent with the specifics of each plan and, where applicable, with relevant national benchmarks. We also assessed whether the discount rate and inflation rates were consistent with our internally developed benchmarks and in line with other companies’ recent external reporting. We evaluated the calculations prepared by the external actuaries to assess the consistency of the assumptions used. We tested the census data by comparing the number of members to the triennial valuation performed in 2018 and investigated any differences. In addition we performed two-way testing of the listings of active members back to the scheme administrator records. We have reviewed the controls report of the administrator and identified no exceptions relating to members data. Based on our procedures, we noted that the discount rate assumption used is at the optimistic end of an acceptable range as a result of a change in the bond universe included within the discount rate model prepared by the group’s actuary. We assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in note 29 of the group financial statements and consider them to be reasonable.| _Refer to Audit Committee report on page 36 and to note 3(b) of the group financial statements._ The group has historically reported specific and other items (including restructuring costs) on the face of the income statement. Consistent with the group’s definition of adjusted profit before interest, tax and amortisation (“Adjusted PBITA”), the following items have continued to be disclosed separately on the face of the consolidated income statement in 2020: net specific items charge of £53m (2019: £13m); restructuring and separation costs £58m (2019: £57m); gain on disposal/closure of subsidiaries/businesses £185m (2019: loss of £5m); California class action settlement £nil (2019: £18m credit) and Goodwill impairment of £58m (2019: £291m). In addition, Serious Fraud Office Deferred Prosecution Agreement charge of £52m; bid defence charges of £34m and asset impairment of £4m have been recorded in 2020. The treatment of specific and other separately We substantiated the nature and quantum of significant individual items to appropriate corroborating evidence. We considered whether the designation of individual items as specific was consistent with the group’s accounting policy and treatment in prior years. Furthermore, we considered whether amounts included as specific items related to current year trading and might be more appropriately reflected in the underlying results. We considered whether the group has taken a balanced approach to this area, checking that exceptional one-off items of income are treated consistently with one-off items of cost. We tested management’s process for identifying and tracking the current year reversal of any prior year specific items, or utilisation of or adjustment to related provisions, to identify whether these have been appropriately presented in the current year income statement. Based on our procedures, ----- INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC For the year ended 31 December 2020 |disclosed items is explained in the group accounting policy in note 3(b). We focused on this area because the classification of items as specific or separate disclosure of items of income or expenditure on the face of the income statement requires judgment and because certain of these items are excluded from the calculation of elements of executive remuneration in line with the group’s remuneration policy. Consistency in the identification and presentation of these items is important to ensure comparability of year-on-year reporting in the Annual Report.|we were satisfied that the treatment and classification of these items were consistent year-on-year and with the group’s policies.| |---|---| |Impact of COVID-19 pandemic (group and parent company) Refer to the Directors Report on page 54 and to note 3 of the group financial statements. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the trading of the group over the course of the year. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought increased estimation uncertainty to certain areas of the financial statements. Management therefore performed a detailed analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the group and parent company financial statements on revenue, profit and cashflows including possible cost of mitigation and relief obtained from counter-measures taken by national governments. The areas where management has given greatest attention to the accounting and disclosure implications are the impairment assessments for goodwill and property, plant & equipment and trade receivables. Furthermore, this analysis has been used in conjunction with an assessment of the group’s liquidity and disclosure of the risks of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and management to conclude on going concern and viability, and which have been disclosed within the relevant sections of the Annual Report. In addition, management’s way of working, including the operation of controls, has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of a large number of employees working remotely and using technology enabled working practices. For example, this has meant that virtual review meetings and electronic review processes (in place of hardcopy reviews) have been performed instead of meetings which were physically attended or review of hardcopy documents.|We assessed management's future forecasts and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the group’s revenue, profit and cashflows. In addition, we have considered the historical accuracy of the budgeting process to assess the reliability of the data. Based on our procedures we concluded that management’s future forecasts are appropriate. Our procedures in respect of the goodwill are covered in the “Goodwill impairment” key audit matter above. We also evaluated management’s assessment of other accounting estimates within the groups and parent company’s financial statements which could be impacted by the challenging economic environment, including the recoverability of property, plant and equipment and of trade receivables. We satisfied ourselves that management's estimates were within acceptable and reasonable ranges. In relation to liquidity we stress tested management’s model and considered to what extent sufficient headroom exists to absorb any further downside risks. Our reporting in respect of going concern is set out in the “Conclusions relating to going concern” section below and in respect of viability is set out in the “Corporate governance statement"" section below. On the basis of the work performed we are satisfied that management have included appropriate disclosures within the Annual Report. In addition, we also assessed our ability to execute the audit when operating under lockdown and the related international travel restrictions. We implemented alternative communication and review protocols with management and with our component auditors. We also held planning meetings ahead of the year-end audit, involving management and certain component auditors, and agreed ways to facilitate a remote audit, including agreeing how we could ensure appropriate access to relevant audit documentation.| _Going concern risk arising as a result of change of control (Group and parent company) Refer to Audit Committee report on page 38 and to note 3(a) of the group financial statements._ As noted on page 2 of the Annual Report, on 6 April 2021, G4S became a subsidiary of Atlas UK Bidco Limited, part of the Allied Universal Security Group (“Allied”). The acquisition of the group has triggered certain change of control rights in the group’s borrowing agreements and this, coupled with scheduled debt redemptions, means that approximately £2.2bn of the group’s outstanding borrowings will require repayment and the group’s £650m revolving credit facility was cancelled shortly after the acquisition. Allied has undertaken to fund the majority of G4S’s forthcoming borrowing repayments through £1.9bn of intra-group lending from Allied to G4S and partially to mitigate the impact of The “Conclusions relating to going concern” section below sets out details of the procedures we performed in relation to going concern and our conclusions. ----- INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC For the year ended 31 December 2020 the cancellation of the revolving credit facility by providing G4S with access to a €300m revolving credit facility via Atlas UK Bidco Limited.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,248,NONCASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES:,248.18,How we tailored the audit scope,248.18.1,,"We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate. In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by us, as the group engagement team, or component auditors within PwC UK and other PwC network firms operating under our instructions. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work in these territories to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. The group is organised into four Secure Solutions reportable segments and one Cash Solutions reportable segment. Corporate head office entities are managed at a group level. Each region (“regional component”) is an aggregation of a number of country-based components along with the group’s interests in joint ventures (together the “country components”). Each region has a separate management team which coordinates the businesses within that region. The group’s accounting processes are structured around a local finance function in each of the country components. In addition, finance shared service centres in the UK, North America and India support certain of the group’s country-based components. The country components report to the regions and to the group through an integrated consolidation system. There are approximately 500 reporting units across all five regions, all of which are considered a country component. Our audit included a full scope audit of the group’s Americas region and a further 28 country components across the remaining four regions within the group. In total this resulted in full scope audits of the complete financial information in 40 country components across 17 countries due to their financial significance to the group, including 12 entities that were directly coordinated by the Americas regional component auditor. We also identified a further 10 country components (of which 3 were directly coordinated by the Americas regional component auditor) which had one or more individual balances that were considered significant to the group’s financial statements. For these components we instructed the component units to perform specific audit procedures to give us the appropriate coverage over the significant balances for our group audit. Furthermore, central testing was also performed on selected items (including taxation, goodwill and intangible assets impairment, treasury, post-retirement benefits and disposal accounting) primarily to ensure appropriate audit coverage. Where the work was performed by regional and country component audit teams, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components. Our group and our regional component audit teams’ involvement included regular dialogue with our country component teams, review of material component auditor work papers and participation in certain component audit clearance meetings for the more significant country components. Taken together, the components and functions where we performed either full scope audit work or specified audit procedures on selected financial statement line items accounted for 71% of consolidated revenue and 73% of consolidated profit before tax. This was before considering the contribution to our audit evidence from performing audit work at the regional and group levels, including disaggregated analytical review procedures and our evaluation of entity level controls, which covered a significant portion of the group’s smaller and lowerrisk components that were not directly included in our group audit scope.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Solely using a profit based materiality does not take into consideration the scale of the group, given the relative low margins and the fact that revenue is a key driver of the business and is identified as a key performance indicator of the group, alongside earnings. In our professional judgement, we have concluded that £25m is the appropriate level at which to set materiality, and we have concluded that any adjustments identified that are lower than £25m in magnitude would not be expected to influence the decisions made by the users of the financial statements. For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £0.3m and £22.5m. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality. We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to £18.75m for the group financial statements and £6.7m for the parent company financial statements. In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £1.2m (group audit) (2019: £1m) and £0.4m (parent company audit) (2019: £0.5m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. |Col1|Financial statements - group|Financial statements - parent company| |---|---|---| |Overall materiality|£25m (2019: £18.5m)|£9m (2019: £10.5m)| |How we determined it|We have used our professional judgement to determine materiality of £25m taking into account the potential range of materiality determined using the following benchmarks: ● 0.5% of revenues resulting in materiality of £35m ● 5% of adjusted profit before tax (‘PBT’), which results in materiality of £16.2m. Using a materiality of £25m equates to 0.36% of revenue and 7.7% of adjusted PBT.|0.8% of net assets (2019: 1% of net assets)| |Rationale for benchmark applied|We have considered it appropriate to take into consideration both revenue and adjusted profit before tax in determining materiality. The group’s principal measure of earnings is profit before interest, tax and amortisation adjusted for a number of items of income and expenditure (“Adjusted PBITA”). Management uses this measure as it believes that it reflects the underlying performance of the group. We took this measure into account in determining our materiality, except that we did not adjust profit before tax to add back amortisation of acquisition- related intangible assets and finance income and expense as in our view these are recurring items which do not introduce volatility to the group’s earnings. Solely using a profit based materiality does not take into consideration the scale of the group, given the relative low margins and the fact that revenue is a key driver of the business and is identified as a key performance indicator of the group, alongside earnings. In our professional judgement, we have concluded that £25m is the appropriate level at which to set materiality, and we have concluded that any adjustments identified that are lower than £25m in magnitude would not be expected to influence the decisions made by the users of the financial statements.|The parent company holds the group’s investments and performs treasury functions on behalf of the group. Therefore, the entity is not in itself profit-oriented. The strength of the balance sheet is the key measure of financial health that is important to shareholders since the primary concern of the parent company is the payment of dividends and servicing of debt.| ----- INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF G4S PLC For the year ended 31 December 2020",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The Group has considered its future funding requirements taking into account its long-term customer contract portfolio, flexible cost base, geographically diverse operating footprint and breadth of customer industry groupings all of which mean that the Group is well placed to manage the direct business impacts and the current global economic uncertainty arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. This consideration has included review of the Group’s budget and business plan over a period of at least 12 months from the signing of the annual report and sensitivity analysis and stress testing of the budget and business plan projections, including severe but plausible downside scenarios (based on enduring Covid-19 related budget and plan shortfalls similar to those experienced in 2020 and earlier than anticipated crystallisation of certain provisions at values above the levels currently provided), over the same period. On 6 April 2021, G4S became a subsidiary of Atlas UK Bidco Limited, part of the Allied Universal Security Group.

Allied has undertaken to fund the majority of G4S’s forthcoming borrowing repayments through £1.9 billion of intragroup lending from Allied to G4S and partially to mitigate the impact of the cancellation of the revolving credit facility by providing G4S with access to a €300m revolving credit facility via Atlas UK Bidco Limited.

Significant accounting policies continued (m) Revenue recognition,248.66.1,,"The Group has no revenue other than that arising from contracts with customers. For the majority of the Group’s services, including the provision of manned security and cash security services, the Group provides services to the customer on a daily basis continuously over the term of the contract and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group. Revenue from these services is therefore recognised over time. For the services set out below, the Group’s right to consideration from its customers generally equates to the value of services supplied to the customer. On this basis, the Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 to recognise revenue when the services are provided for the amount that the Group has a right to invoice for those services. The practical expedient is applied to revenue recognised in the following services: - Secure Solutions services including the provision of on-site, mobile and remote security, technology-enabled monitoring and response, risk consulting and integrated security solutions. In addition, most contracts for facilities management and Care & Justice Services apply the practical expedient. - Cash Solutions services including the provision of conventional cash services (cash in transit, cash processing and ATM services) and cash technology services (including some Cash 360 services and bank process automation). The Group also provides additional services (listed below) where the Group’s right to consideration from its customers does not equate to the value of services supplied to the customer. In these cases, mainly related to long-term contracts, revenue is recognised over time due to either: a. the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefit of the services; and/or b. the Group creating an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; and/or c. the Group’s performance not creating an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group having an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. In these cases revenue is recognised over time primarily using input methods based on costs incurred as a proportion of the total expected costs of the contract. The following services apply this method of revenue recognition: - Secure Solutions services including the provision of security alarm installations and related on-going maintenance and monitoring services, and certain long-term facilities management and Care & Justice Services contracts. - Cash Solutions services including the provision and/or rental of smart safes and cash recycling equipment, including the use of any proprietary software. Where installation contracts include the outright sale of equipment, revenue in respect of the sale and installation is recognised when the equipment is installed. Where equipment cannot be sold without the provision of on-going maintenance or other services and in contracts for the rental of equipment, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract. On-going maintenance and monitoring services represent a series of services with a constant pattern of transfer to the customer over time. Revenue in respect of such services is recognised over the period of the contract. For contracts that involve the rental of equipment, the Group determines whether the arrangement constitutes a lease under IFRS 16.

In the small amount of cases in which the practical expedient is not applied as the Group’s right to consideration does not equate to the value of services provided to date, the standalone selling price is estimated based on market prices where available. Certain of the Group’s contracts include payments that vary depending on its performance, including payments or penalties that are determined based on the Group achieving KPIs. In such cases, the amount of revenue recognised is limited to the extent that it is not highly probable that the Group will ultimately receive payment. In a small number of contracts, the Group procures goods or services from a third party and provides them to the end customer as part of the overall delivery of the contract. The Group considers that it is acting as principal if it is in control of these goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer, and an agent where it is arranging for them to be provided to the customer without obtaining control. For the majority of the Group’s contracts, invoices are raised in the month or months after the delivery of services. Accrued income arises in relation to services provided that have not been invoiced at the year end.

In general, provisions recognised for future losses are charged to the consolidated income statement within net specific items.

The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax, and excludes charges for interest on tax and certain penalties on tax settlements, which are reported within finance expenses and administration expenses respectively. Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that their recovery is probable, having regard to the projected future taxable income of these entities and after taking into account specific risk factors that affect the recovery of these assets. The same profit projections are used for these purposes as are used by the business, for example in assessing the carrying value of goodwill. Judgment is applied on a case-by-case basis due to the jurisdictional nature of taxation. This analysis is considered afresh at each balance sheet date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of potential deferred tax assets is re-assessed at each balance sheet date and recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow those assets to be recovered. Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated due to changes in tax legislation, differing interpretations of tax legislation and uncertainties surrounding the application of tax legislation. In situations where uncertainties exist, provision is made for tax liabilities and assets on the basis of management judgment following consideration of the available relevant information.

For all other leases, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is made available for use by the Group. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the future lease payments including fixed payments, in-substance fixed payments, and variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, less any lease incentives receivable. The Group applies the practical expedient to include non-lease components in the measurement of lease liabilities. Lease liabilities also take into account amounts payable under residual value guarantees and payments to exercise options to the extent that it is reasonably certain that such payments will be made. The payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease or, where that cannot be measured, at an incremental borrowing rate determined based on publicly available data for liabilities with matching start dates, terms and currencies, adjusted for the country-specific risk of the lessee. No adjustment is made to reflect the nature of the leased assets on the basis that a lender would not make a material adjustment to the borrowing rate to reflect the nature of the underlying assets. Lease assets are measured based on the value of the associated lease liability, adjusted for any payments made before inception and initial direct costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group records an interest charge in respect of the lease liability. The related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the term of the lease or, if shorter, the useful economic life of the leased asset unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will acquire the asset at the end of the lease in which case it is recognised over the asset’s useful economic life.

Those rates have been estimated based on publicly available rates for borrowings of the same tenure, start date and currency, adjusted for the Group’s credit rating and for the credit rating of the Group entity entering the lease. Determining the rate at which an individual entity could borrow funds on the same terms as an individual lease requires significant estimation. The average incremental borrowing rate used for leases that were in place during the year ended 31 December 2020 was 5.32% (2019: 5.18%). If the incremental borrowing rates used at 31 December 2020 were decreased by 100bps in respect of all of the Group’s leases, then the Group’s lease liabilities would increase by approximately £6m (£5m relating to land and buildings and £1m to property and equipment) with a consequential effect on right-of-use assets. An increase of 100bps would decrease the Group’s lease liabilities by approximately £6m (£5m relating to land and buildings and £1m relating to property and equipment).

The terms of the agreement required the Group to pay a sum of £38m to Allied, to be held in escrow, in the event that Allied failed to acquire the Group. The Group concluded that the cooperation agreement contained a financial liability in respect of the possible future outflow because the success of Allied’s bid was outside of the control of the Group. In accordance with IFRS 9, a financial liability is required to be recorded at fair value on initial recognition. The fair value of the potential £38m liability would take into account the probability of the out flow arising. As at 31 December 2020, the Allied offer had been unanimously recommended by the G4S plc Board, the directors of which had irrevocably undertaken to accept the offer in respect of their own shares. In contrast, the Board had unanimously recommended that shareholders reject the ‘Increased and Final Cash Offer’ issued by GardaWorld on 2 December 2020. The directors assessed the probability of a future outflow arising in the light of the recommended offer and concluded that it was virtually certain that Allied would be successful in acquiring the Group. On that basis, the fair value of the liability was determined to be immaterial. If the probability of Allied succeeding had been lower then an additional liability and income statement expense of up to £38m would have been recognised. On 6 April 2021, G4S became a subsidiary of Atlas UK Bidco Limited, part of the Allied Universal Security Group resulting in G4S plc being released from any potential obligation to pay the break fee and the amount held in escrow in this respect was repaid on 9 April 2021. ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Specific item charges incurred during the year ended 31 December 2019 of £38m included a £15m non-recurring, non-cash expense incurred when the Group updated its HR policy formally to waive its rights to recover certain recruitment-related costs under local law in the Gulf States.

The Group’s annual impairment test compares the carrying value of goodwill and other relevant non-current assets held by each cashgenerating unit (CGU) with the recoverable amount of each CGU as at 31 December each year. An impairment is recognised when the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying value of goodwill and other relevant non-current assets. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGUs which are expected to benefit from that business combination. The Group has identified CGUs for goodwill impairment testing purposes on a country-level basis with each country divided into separate Cash Solutions and Secure Solutions CGUs where applicable. The CGUs are consistent with the way in which the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews performance. The recoverable amount of a CGU is generally determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash flow calculations. The key inputs to the calculations are described below. If market prices can be ascertained (for example through recent transactions, by reference to normal industry standard multiples, or by using future forecast cash flows discounted to current value), and fair value less costs to sell exceeds the value in use, then fair value less costs to sell measured on a basis consistent with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy is used to determine the recoverable amount (as described in note 3(g).",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The budgets and forecasts are reviewed at segment and group level and are approved by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The budgets and forecasts form the basis of the estimated future cash flows used in the Group’s impairment test. The key assumptions that are made in determining the Group’s budget and forecasts vary between CGUs. However, they typically include assumptions about the Group’s ability to win and retain work (particularly as its existing contracts come to an end); the margins that will be achieved; and the Group’s ability to control its fixed cost base. In making those assumptions, management assesses current run-rates, adjusted for known wins and losses and for expected changes in market conditions. In undertaking the Group’s impairment tests, the budgets and forecasts approved by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker are adjusted to the extent that events since they were developed (for example, the subsequent loss of contracts) indicate that they may no longer be achievable. In making such adjustments, particular attention is given to the final two years of the forecasts to ensure that the increased uncertainty inherent in the forecasts in later years and any additional risk affecting the forecast results for those years are adequately reflected.

Adjusted risk-free rate (country specific) Country-specific risk-free rates are derived for each CGU by adjusting the Group’s risk-free rate for both the relevant inflation rate differential between the UK and that CGU’s country and by applying an appropriate country-specific risk premium sourced primarily from the IMF and New York University websites as well as other studies by independent economists. Unleveraged beta Beta is a risk adjustment applied to the discount rate to reflect the risk of the Group’s operating companies relative to the market as a whole. The Group’s beta is estimated by performing an analysis of comparable multi-national listed companies and is adjusted for the appropriate leverage of the Group. Debt margin The Group applies a Group-wide debt margin to the country-specific risk-free rates to obtain a cost of debt for each CGU. The debt margin is determined by calculating the premium between the yield on a BBB- rated 15+ year UK benchmark bond and the UK risk-free rate. Weighted-average cost of capital (pre-tax) The weighted-average cost of capital is calculated by weighting the cost of equity and the cost of debt by the applicable debt to equity ratio at the year end. ----- ----- NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The recoverable amount of £5m at 31 December 2020 has been based on fair value less costs to sell, since this was greater than its value in use, calculated using a Level 3 measure by applying a multiple of 7.5x budgeted 2021 EBITDA. The multiple of 7.5x was determined with reference to management’s experience of recent transactions and publicly available data about global valuations of security businesses. A fall in the multiple to 6.0x, which management believe would be reasonably possible, would result in an additional impairment of approximately £1m to the other non-current assets within the CGU. The budgeted EBITDA for 2021 was developed through a bottom-up process based on the closing run-rate of the business in 2020, adjusted to exclude the effect of one-off items incurred in 2020 and for known or expected changes in the business in 2021. In the event that the business fails to achieve its budget, then a reduction in budgeted EBITDA of 50%, or £0.3m, which management believes is reasonably possible in the light of experience with the business in 2020, would result in a further impairment of the CGU of approximately £3m. During the year ended 31 December 2019, the business recorded a goodwill impairment of £35m following a rapid and unforeseen decline in its performance reflecting continuing challenging trading conditions in that country, an adverse macro-economic environment expected to continue for a prolonged period and a step-change in the cost base of the businesses. As a result, the recoverable amount of the Brazil Secure Solutions CGU at 31 December 2019 of £43m was determined based on fair value less cost to sell, since that was greater than its value in use, calculated using a Level 3 measure by applying a multiple of 10.0x budget EBITDA on an IAS 17 basis of £4.3m.

The value in use exceeded the carrying value of the CGU by £10m (2019: £9m). The forecast cash flows are driven by assumptions around PBITA and are particularly sensitive to the business’ ability to achieve its 2020 budget, which is, in turn, dependent on the business being able to return margins to historic levels achieved prior to 2019. If it is unable to return PBITA to historic levels then the goodwill may become impaired. In particular, if in isolation, either the forecast growth in PBITA falls by 33% in all periods or the discount rate was increased from 12.5% to 16.1% then the headroom will become eroded to £nil.

The Group’s policy is to continue to manage its capital structure to retain an investment-grade rating. The Group’s policy objective is a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of between 2.0x and 2.5x. At the end of 2020 the ratio was 2.32x (2019: 2.88x). In May 2020 the Group issued £300m of commercial paper maturing in May 2021 paying 0.65% (see note 24). Following the sale of the majority of the Group’s conventional cash business, the Group reduced the amount available to draw under the Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’) by £100m to £650m. In June 2020 the Group also exercised the second option to extend the term of the RCF by a further year, resulting in £136m maturing in 2024 and £514m maturing in 2025. As at 31 December 2020 this facility was undrawn (2019: £240m drawn down). The Group also cancelled the undrawn bridge facility which had been reduced from £300m to £200m in March 2020 The debt maturities in 2020 comprise the $75m US private placement notes repaid in July 2020. Overall the debt portfolio has a medium to long-term debt maturity profile and the Group remains well placed to access finance from the debt-capital markets and from the bank market. Borrowings are principally in Sterling, US Dollars and Euros reflecting the geographies of the Group's significant operational assets and profits. The committed bank facilities and the private loan notes are subject to a financial covenant of 3.5x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio (where Adjusted EBITDA is based on Group Adjusted PBITA before depreciation and amortisation of non-acquisition-related intangible assets) adjusted to exclude investments and the effect of adopting IFRS 16 – Leases. Non-compliance with the covenant may lead to an acceleration of maturity. During the 2020 and 2019 reporting periods the Group has complied with the financial covenants of its borrowing facilities and has not defaulted on, or breached, the terms of any material loans. On 6 April 2021, G4S became a subsidiary of Atlas UK Bidco Limited, part of the Allied Universal Security Group. The acquisition of the Group has triggered certain change of control rights in the Group’s borrowing agreements and this, coupled with scheduled debt redemptions, means that approximately £2.2 billion of the Group’s outstanding borrowings will require repayment in 2021. The Group’s £650m revolving credit facility, which was undrawn as at 31 December 2020, was also cancelled in full on the 13 April 2020 as required under its change of control clause and is no longer available to draw. Allied has undertaken to fund the majority of G4S’s forthcoming borrowing repayments through £1.9 billion of intragroup lending from Allied to G4S and partially to mitigate the impact of the cancellation of the revolving credit facility by providing G4S with access to a €300m revolving credit facility via Atlas UK Bidco Limited.",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

Allied Universal have agreed to pay a one-off cash lump sum of £50m into the pension schemes once this funding valuation has been agreed, followed by annual contributions of £80m per annum for the calendar years 2021 to 2026 inclusive. In addition, the company pledged to the Pension Scheme a share of the proceeds arising from the sale of a material part of the Group, with material for these purposes defined as being in excess of 10% of the Group's consolidated total assets. The proportion of the sale proceeds due to the Pension Scheme is to be calculated in terms of the amount by which the divested total assets exceed 10% of the Group's consolidated total assets and the proportion that the Pension Scheme actuarial deficit bears to overall group indebtedness. On 26th February 2021 the company agreed and paid £18m to the Pension Scheme in respect of this pledge. The Group has concluded that it should allow for a refund of any residual surplus in all three sections of the UK pension scheme assuming wind-up after all benefits have been paid in the normal course of events. Therefore no adjustments for asset ceiling or additional liabilities under the IFRIC 14 interpretation are made. At present the GSL section has a surplus and the other two sections have deficits. The IASB recently decided not to proceed with changes to IFRIC 14 proposed in 2015 but has not stopped its IFRIC 14 project.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,248,NONCASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES:,248.106,Principal risks,248.106.1,,"The Group’s pension schemes create a number of risk exposures. Annual increases in benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels (including the impact of inflation on future salary increases) and the actual longevity of the membership. Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms. Principal risks** _continued A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension plans. For the UK funding valuation those assumed investment returns (for funding valuations) are set based on fixed margins over the gilt yield curve. The management of the UK pension fund assets has been delegated to an asset manager, who manages the assets against a liability benchmark. The key parameters of this mandate can be summarised as follows: Risk Description Mitigation Asset mix The plan assets may fall in value. The assets are managed dynamically over time rather than a set strategic allocation. Interest rate risk The plan assets may fall in value as a result of a fall in interest rates. Inflation risk The plan assets may fall in value as a result of rise in inflation. Currency risk Any plan assets held in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Regulatory risk All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions. These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject to change and may impact the Group’s pension schemes. Actuarial assumptions risk Actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the expected benefit payments including future inflation, salary growth and life expectancy. The DBO and service cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefit payments. The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. Managed with the benchmark of hedging 100% of these risks as a percentage of the asset value through the use of debt instruments (government bonds) and derivatives. Managed with the benchmark of hedging 100% of these risks as a percentage of the asset value through the use of debt instruments (government bonds) and derivatives. Managed with the objective of hedging at least 70% of the overseas currency exposure in the portfolio through the use of forward foreign currency contracts. G4S monitors changes in regulations in the UK and the Netherlands to assess the potential impact these changes could have on the Group’s material pension schemes. The UK pension trustees have adopted investment strategies to mitigate changes in key assumptions applied to the valuation of pension liabilities for funding purposes. These strategies mainly hedge against interest rate and inflation expectations generally, as described above, but do not specifically seek to hedge against changes in credit spreads that also affect the IAS 19 discount rate. As a result the difference between the market value of the assets and the valuation of the pension obligations under IAS 19 may be volatile. ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",N/A,as_expected,2021,629

The charge reflects a financial penalty of £39m, plus £6m for the settlement of the SFO’s full investigation costs and £7m of legal and other costs in relation to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The claim was settled in August 2020. The Group’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries primarily in Guernsey and the US underwrite part of the Group’s Cash Solutions, general liability, workers’ compensation, directors and officers and auto liability policies.

Whilst the outcome of such contracts is inherently uncertain, the Group is satisfied that it is unlikely that changes in these contracts will have a material impact on the Group’s overall provision in the next 12 months. Management believes that the current level of provision is balanced and that any significant potential downside from possible changes to key assumptions could be offset by further progress made in those profit improvement plans that have not been considered following the Group’s policy described above.

Currently there are a number of disputes open in relation to the application of local labour law, commercial agreements with customers and subcontractors and claims and compliance matters, in some cases in the course of litigation. In addition, the interpretation of tax and labour laws and regulations in a number of countries where the Group operates is complex and there is inherent judgment made when applying those laws and regulations that are open to interpretation. As such, there is risk that further disputes and claims from tax authorities and employees could arise in the future. Where there is a dispute or where there is a risk of a dispute or claims in the future and where, based on legal counsel advice, the Group estimates that it is probable that the dispute will result in an outflow of economic resources, provision is made based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely financial outcome. Where a reliable estimate cannot be made, or where the Group, based on legal counsel advice, considers that it is not probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources, no provision is recognised. The Group is party to a number of on-going litigation processes, in relation to interpretation of local labour law and regulations in a number of countries, where it is expected that these matters will not be resolved in the near future. At this stage, the Group’s view is that these cases will either be resolved in a manner favourable to the interests of the Group or, due to the nature and complexity of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the potential economic exposure. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, other contingent liabilities exist where the Group is subject to commercial claims and litigation from a range of parties in respect of contracts, agreements, regulatory and compliance matters, none of which are expected to have a material impact on the Group. During 2019 the Group received a claim seeking damages for alleged losses following the reduction in the G4S share price in 2013. At this point, the Group is unable to make a reliable estimate of the merit, outcome or impact of any potential litigation relating to this claim therefore no provision has been made in respect of it. In April 2020, the Group received requests for information from the Belgian Competition Authority (“BCA”) and the US Department of Justice Antitrust Division (“DoJ”) in connection with the Group’s Belgian business. The BCA and DoJ inquiries are continuing and the Group is engaging and cooperating fully with both authorities. During the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group recognised a charge of £43m in respect of these inquiries after taking into account estimates of the potential financial penalties which might arise on completion of the inquiry process ranging from £25m to £50m in aggregate. There is a wide range of possible outcomes in respect of these inquiries, including the imposition of incremental financial penalties, third-party claims and/or debarment from certain tendering processes which might lead to a potential financial impact materially outside the currently estimated range of financial penalties. The Group is currently involved in a number of claims in India, mainly related to periods prior to 2011, in relation to the interpretation of the basis for payments to the India Provident Fund. These disputes are currently awaiting court resolution. Based on the Group’s internal and external legal advice, and taking into account the judgment passed by the Supreme Court of India in respect of a different Provident Fund related question on 28 February 2019, the Group believes it has a strong legal position that will prevail in the courts such that no economic outflow is expected to occur and hence no provision has been booked at the year end. The aggregate of the Provident Fund related claims amount to approximately £50m. In 2019, the Group received notification of a potential claim in the US relating to alleged payments in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2017. At this stage the potential claim is in its very early stages.

305_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,248,NONCASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES:,248.130,(c) Significant accounting policies,248.130.1,,"Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments held at fair value through profit and loss, in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’)). The principal accounting policies and measurement bases adopted are the same as those disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements including the new standards adopted, except as noted below, and have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless stated otherwise. Judgments made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies which have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, have been disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Going concern The company’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance, cash flows and financial position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 27. In addition, note 28 to the financial statements includes the company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group has considered its future funding requirements taking into account its long-term customer contract portfolio, flexible cost base, geographically diverse operating footprint and breadth of customer industry groupings all of which mean that the Group is well placed to manage the direct business impacts and the current global economic uncertainty arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. This consideration has included review of the Group’s budget and business plan over a period of at least 12 months from the signing of the annual report and sensitivity analysis and stress testing of the budget and business plan projections, including severe but plausible downside scenarios (based on enduring Covid-19 related budget and plan shortfalls similar to those experienced in 2020 and earlier than anticipated crystallisation of certain provisions at values above the levels currently provided), over the same period. On 6 April 2021, G4S became a subsidiary of Atlas UK Bidco Limited, part of the Allied Universal Security Group. The acquisition of the Group has triggered certain change of control rights in the Group’s borrowing agreements and this, coupled with scheduled debt redemptions, means that approximately £2.2 billion of the Group’s outstanding borrowings will require repayment in 2021 and the Group’s £650m revolving credit facility was cancelled shortly after 6 April 2021. Allied has undertaken to fund the majority of G4S’s forthcoming borrowing repayments through £1.9 billion of intragroup lending from Allied to G4S and partially to mitigate the impact of the cancellation of the revolving credit facility by providing G4S with access to a €300m revolving credit facility via Atlas UK Bidco Limited. Atlas Ontario LP, the ultimate holding company of the Allied Universal Security Group, and certain key Allied Group companies (collectively the “Allied Parties”) have entered into a Deed of Undertaking with G4S, under which the Allied Parties irrevocably and unconditionally undertake to (and undertakes to procure that its Affiliates and Subsidiaries (excluding G4S and the Group will)): - provide such financial support to the Group as is required for the Company (and each member of the Group) to continue to be able to operate as a going concern and meet its debts as they fall due; - not seek the early repayment of any amounts advanced to the Group by it, or any of its Affiliates, and shall only seek to refinance the Group's existing financial indebtedness using committed funding made available on appropriate terms such that (taking into account such alternative funding) the Company (and each member of the Group) will continue to be able to operate as a going concern and meet its debts as they fall due; and - advance to the Company (and the Group) such amounts as the Company (and each member of the Group) may require in order to ensure that the Company (and each member of the Group) is able to operate as a going concern, meet its debts as they fall due and fulfil its day-to-day funding and liquidity needs; ----- NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS with such undertakings to remain in full force and effect for a period ending on the date falling 12 months after the date of approval of the Group’s financial statements. As part of the Deed of Undertaking, the Allied Parties have represented and warranted the quantum and maturity of the incremental financing facilities that have been entered into in connection with the G4S acquisition and that they will, at all times have sufficient and available committed financing sources to meet their (and their Subsidiaries’ and the Group’s) financing requirements for the duration of the 12 month assessment period. The Group has made enquiries to assess the information provided in respect of the incremental financing facilities. Having considered the assessment of the Group’s future funding requirements, sensitivity analysis and stress testing of the Group’s budget and business plan as set out above and on the basis of the irrevocable and unconditional undertaking entered into by the Allied Parties, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence and meet its liabilities for the foreseeable future. For this reason the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the company financial statements. Exemptions In accordance with section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement. The company has taken advantage of certain disclosure exemptions in FRS 101, in part because its financial statements are included in the publicly-available consolidated financial statements of G4S plc. These disclosure exemptions relate to: - the requirements of IAS 7 – Statement of Cash Flows; - the statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union; - new IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and which have not been applied by the company; - comparative information for the movements from the beginning to the end of the year in respect of intangible assets and certain other additional comparative information; - information on the assumptions used in the determination of fair value and recoverable amounts of cash-generating units containing goodwill and management’s approach to determining these amounts; - financial instruments disclosures required by IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures; - disclosures required by IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement; - certain related-party disclosures on key management compensation and transactions entered into between two or more whollyowned members of a Group; and - capital management disclosures. Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment. The accounting policy for impairments is disclosed in note 3(i) to the consolidated financial statements. Intangible assets Intangible assets primarily relate to expenditure incurred in developing the Javelin ERP system and are stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is charged to the income statement to write off the cost of the assets by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives, up to a maximum of 10 years. Amounts owed by/to Group undertakings Amounts owed by/to Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Finance income and expense are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method. The company uses simplified approach for the impairment review of trade receivables and general approach for the loans to subsidiaries. Amounts owed by Group undertakings are classified according to the intention of repayment of these loans. Share-based payments The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and is either expensed in income statement if it relates to employees of the company or capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary if it relates to the employees of a subsidiary company, with a corresponding increase in equity, and amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. The amount expensed or capitalised is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions. The company also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are recognised as a liability at fair value at the date of grant. The value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date on which the liability is settled. The fair value of cash-settled share-based payments is expensed in the income statement if it relates to employees of the company and capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary if it relates to employees of a subsidiary company. ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ## $2,960,000,000 €813,000,000 £367,700,000 $900,000,000     % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 $775,000,000     % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 €813,000,000     % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 £367,700,000      % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 $1,285,000,000     Senior Notes due 2029 # OFFERING CIRCULAR Joint Book-Running Managers for the USD notes",N/A,as_expected,2021,629
