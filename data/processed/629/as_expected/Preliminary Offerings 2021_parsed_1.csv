By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. These factors include, among others: - our UK operations are subject to significant oversight by UK regulators that view our operations as “higher risk” activities. Failure to comply with such applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice relating to debt purchase, collection and asset management industries in the UK could result in substantial losses and the suspension, termination or impairment of our ability to conduct business; - we are subject to extensive regulatory requirements in jurisdictions other than the UK in which we operate and failure to comply with such applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice relating to debt purchase, collection and asset management industries in these jurisdictions could result in substantial losses and the suspension, termination or impairment of our ability to conduct business; - following the establishment of our Fund and Investment Management business, our fund managers, AGG Capital Management Limited, Norfin and Sagitta, are subject to various laws, regulations and codes of practice applicable to the fund management industry.

----- - we are subject to oversight by, and owe contractual obligations of compliance to, Investment Portfolio Sellers; - we are subject to risks by virtue of the requirements applicable to DCAs and other servicers; - we are subject to voluntary codes of conduct; - changes to the regulatory environment in the future in the jurisdictions in which we operate or an increasing volume of legislation may materially adversely affect the debt purchase and collection and fund and asset management industries and impede our business and/or increase our costs; - the ability to obtain, process, share and retain customer data is critical to us and is heavily regulated by privacy, data protection and related laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate and improper disclosure of our clients’ sensitive data, consumer data or a breach of data protection laws could negatively affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition; - our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; - changes in the economic and/or political environment and/or the climate in the markets in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition; - legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the nature of the future relationship between the UK and the European Union is likely to be a source of instability in international markets, could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our business and result in new regulatory challenges and costs; - terrorist attacks, war and threats of attacks and war may materially and adversely affect consumer spending, and in turn, our financial condition, financial returns and results of operation; - rising interest rates could impair the ability of customers to pay their debts and/or lead to volatility in real estate prices which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition; - there may not be sufficient supply of portfolios, or appropriately priced portfolios, available for purchase, and a decrease in our ability to purchase portfolios could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; - we may not be able to procure sufficient funding to purchase further portfolios as they become available on acceptable terms or at all; ----- - we may be unable to compete with businesses that offer higher prices for portfolios or may otherwise face intensive competitive pressure;

- the statistical models and analytical tools we use in our business, including in our calculation of ERC and Net Deal IRR, may prove to be inaccurate and we may not achieve anticipated recoveries; - we are highly dependent on our data analytics systems and proprietary customer profiles, and if we lost access to such data or if the quality and quantity of such data is reduced, or if competitors develop comparable tools, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected; - we may not succeed in growing our Fund and Investment Management business revenue, and Asset Management and Servicing business revenue and/or such revenue sources may become less profitable; - we may be unable to continue to perform our duties as a fund manager and may be unable to raise future funds from third-party LP investors, limiting our ability to grow and decreasing our income from management and performance fees; - the vertical alignment of our local platforms under a fund management framework may not prove successful; - we might be unable to maintain key relationships necessary to conduct our business; - we would be adversely affected if third parties, including DCAs, law firms and servicers performing servicing and other collections activities on our, the Fund’s or future funds’ portfolios, perform poorly or fail to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements;

- our operations are highly dependent upon access to, and the functioning and security of, IT applications, systems and infrastructure. A cyber-attack within the business or through the supply chain that impacts systems, processes, or data, compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability could result in financial losses, regulatory sanctions, and reputational damage; - we outsource most of our core IT applications, systems and infrastructure to third-party service providers and may have difficulty identifying and retaining suitable alternative service providers; - we may not be able to successfully anticipate, manage or adopt technological changes within the debt purchase, fund and asset management and the financial services industries; - the need to adapt to customers’ changing circumstances and changes to real-estate markets may result in increased Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs, reduced cash flow or imprecise modeling; - uneven portfolio supply patterns may prevent us from pursuing all of the purchase opportunities we would like to, and may result in us experiencing uneven cash flows and financial results; - errors in our collection process or other operational matters could have a negative effect on our business and reputation; - negative attention and news regarding the debt purchase and collection industry and individual debt purchasers or collectors, including us and our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses, may have a negative impact on a customer’s willingness to pay a debt owed to us and may diminish our attractiveness as a counterparty for Investment Portfolio Sellers and other third parties; - our senior management team members and key employees are important to our continued success and the loss of one or more members of our senior management team or one or more of our key employees could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations; - increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages could negatively affect our business; - a portion of our collections depends on success in individual lawsuits and court processes.

We may be held liable for the acts of third parties, including DCAs’, if we fail to implement and maintain sufficient oversight arrangements; - the failure of our confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary processes and systems could materially adversely affect our business ; - we use a number of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which could prove to be incorrect or cause our earnings to fluctuate; - Forward Flow Agreements may contractually require us to purchase portfolios at a higher price than desired; - we are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; - derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses; - Bidco has made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition in forecasts that may prove to be materially inaccurate; - the Target Group may have liabilities that are not known to us; - certain of the Group’s contracts contain change of control provisions, which may allow counterparties to terminate such contracts under circumstances such as the Acquisition; - we have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted annualized data and other financial information not prepared in accordance with IFRS; - this Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties; ----- - risks relating to our financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees; and - risks relating to our structure.

(2) We intend to redeem the Existing Notes with a portion of the proceeds of the Offering. (3) We do not intend to repay and cancel the Non-Recourse Facilities and the Miscellaneous Facilities with the proceeds of the Offering. Further, the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been re-presented in the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The re-presentation relates to certain balance sheet items including (i) the inclusion of £26.6 million of bank balances within cash and cash equivalents, that were previously shown within trade and other receivables (this cash balance may be subject to constraints regarding when the balance can be remitted, such as cash in a consolidated securitization structure awaiting a payment date); and (ii) the reclassification of £21.7 million from ‘other operating expenses’ to ‘collection activity and fund management costs’ as part of the change in the segmental reporting structure as a result of the Target Group now being managed through an integrated asset management model. The total impact on operating expenses as a result of the reclassification is nil. For further information on the re-presentation of the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations” and_ “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Information.” As noted above, the Target Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which differs in various significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). In making an investment decision, you should rely upon your own examination of the terms of the Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS on one hand and U.S. GAAP on the other hand, and how those differences could affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. The results of operations for prior fiscal years may not be necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the Target Group to use certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Target Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” After the completion of the Acquisition, the Target Group will not prepare separate consolidated financial statements and we instead intend to report our consolidated financial results at the level of the Parent. Due to this, our future financial statements may not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum. Our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may ----- not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition _and Results of Operations—Factors Impacting Comparability—Reporting.”_ On the Issue Date, ACMH, ACML and ACML’s subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries and therefore not subject to the restrictions under the Indenture. No separate financial information for ACMH and its subsidiaries is included in this Offering Memorandum and the results of these Unrestricted Subsidiaries are consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, and the six months ended June 30, 2021, the consolidated EBITDA generated by such Unrestricted Subsidiaries was £0.1 million and £1.4 million, which for the six months ended June 30, 2021, represented 2.3% of our total consolidated EBITDA (before Acquisition costs). Further, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 97% of the total revenue for the Asset Management and Servicing and Fund and Investment businesses and total collections received by the Balance Sheet business were received directly by Restricted Group. The remaining 3% was received by ACML, but indirectly received by Restricted Group pursuant to recharges for services that certain of the Restricted Subsidiaries provided to ACML. Additionally, a Restricted Subsidiary, Arrow Global Limited, holds preferred ordinary shares in ACML, entitling it to all dividends declared and paid by the Fund Manager.

For us, this typically means that the EIR is set based on forecast 84-Month ERC at the date of purchase and the loan portfolio purchase price. EIR is reassessed and may be adjusted up to 12 months after the purchase of each loan portfolio. For portfolio investments measured at fair value through the profit and loss, the EIR typically is calculated using the to the lifetime ERC rather than an 84-Month ERC; - “Existing Portfolios,” which mean all investment portfolios that we own at the relevant point in time, which are shown as “portfolio investments” on our balance sheet; and - “Working capital adjustments,” which included, historically, the net movement on debtors and creditors, excluding the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility, NonRecourse Facilities, the 2024 Notes and related accrued interest, the 2025 Notes and related accrued interest and the 2026 Notes and related accrued interest, and corporation tax debtors and creditors.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,140,MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA,140.11,Other Financial Information,140.11.2,Financial measures not prepared in accordance with IFRS,"We use certain financial measures and related ratios to measure our performance, including measures that are not determined in accordance with IFRS. We believe that when assessing our financial performance, it is important to consider both IFRS measures included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and complementary measures not prepared in accordance with IFRS and not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that these complementary measures that are not determined in accordance with IFRS and not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements provide investors additional useful information relating to the performance of our purchased loan portfolios. These measures are used in the calculation of the Target Group’s IFRS financial measures, such as total income and the balance sheet carrying value on purchased loan portfolios, which are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-IFRS measures for which we provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS measures (and which are also subject to the qualifications described below) include the following: - “Adjusted EBITDA,” which we define as profit/(loss) for the year adjusted to exclude the effects of finance income and costs, taxation credit/(charge) on ordinary activities, portfolio amortization, depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gains/(losses), amortization of acquisition and bank facility fees, gain on disposal of leases, profit/(loss) on disposal of intangible assets, share-based payments and deferred consideration renegotiations. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that it may enhance an investor’s understanding of our performance, our ability to service our debt and other obligations, to maintain our operations and to fund our continued growth, and because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. We provide the supplemental reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash flow and to Balance Sheet Cash Collections because they may enhance an investor’s understanding of our cash flow generation that could be used to service or pay down debt, pay income taxes, purchase new portfolio investments and for other uses, as a supplemental measure of profitability. Further, our leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of Secured Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. In addition to ERC, our management monitors Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating cash flow because it is not impacted by such short-term non-cash movements. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA represents the operating cash flow generation potential of the business available for the servicing of debt and taxation, before investment decisions in portfolio investments purchases, which are discretionary; - “Adjusted Free Cash Flow,” which means Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, income taxes and overseas taxation paid and amounts paid for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. See “Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Adjusted Free Cash Flow” for a reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow_ to net cash from operating activities. ----- We present Adjusted Free Cash Flow because we believe that similar free cash flows measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating similar issuers. Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be considered as a measure of cash flow from operations under IFRS or as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a metric used by management and is intended to be a measure of cash flow available for our discretionary use and before any investment in portfolio acquisitions; - “EBITDA” means our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and foreign exchange gains and losses; - “Net Debt,” which represents the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes (in each case, until their redemption using a portion of the proceeds from the Offering of the Notes), amounts outstanding under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility, the Non-Recourse Facilities, the Miscellaneous Facilities and deferred consideration payable in relation to the acquisition of portfolio investments and subsidiaries and associates, less cash and cash equivalents. After giving effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, from the Issue Date, Net Debt will include the amount outstanding under the Notes, the Revolving Facility, the Non-Recourse Facilities and Miscellaneous Facilities, less cash and cash equivalents; - “Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA” represents our annualized Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted for our targeted cost savings intended as a result of certain organizational changes and completion of strategic review. We present Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA because it provides useful information regarding a company’s ability to service and incur indebtedness, particularly in light of COVID-19 pandemic-related effects on our audited historical data, which impacted our result for the year ended December 31, 2021 and six months ended June 30, 2021. Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operation; - “Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA” represents our Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for the run-rate effect of revenues from our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses. We also present Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA on an annualized basis which is derived by multiplying our Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021 by two; - “Secured Net Debt” represents our Net Debt that is secured by certain assets and collateral; and - “Underlying profit before tax” represents our reported profit before tax before the deduction of exceptional costs or before the inclusion of exceptional revenues such as exceptional collection activity costs, exceptional other operating expenses and exceptional finance costs. The purpose of this metric is to adjust our profit for one-off exceptional items to assist the user in understanding the underlying results. ----- Complementary measures and ratios that are not presented in or derived from measures that are presented in our consolidated financial statements, and are not prepared in accordance with IFRS (and are subject to the qualifications described below), include the following: - “Assets under management” or “AUM,” refers to the face value of debt portfolios that we manage or service on behalf of our clients who own the debt portfolios; - “Capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA,” which means sum of the Fund and Investment Management business EBITDA and Asset Management and Servicing business EBITDA calculated as a percentage of total EBITDA. We present Capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA because we believe that it enhances an investor’s understanding of our new integrated asset manager business model and represents the percentage of our business that is capital-light and supported by our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses; - “EBITDA Margin” is a measure of our EBITDA as a percentage of our total income; - “Funds under management” or “FUM,” means the value of all fund management assets managed by us, including Arrow Credit Opportunities, Norfin, Europa Investimenti, Sagitta, any of our own capital which we have committed to invest alongside third parties committed capital and our back book; - “Gross IRR,” which means a loan portfolio’s gross internal rate of return and is calculated using actual cash collections from date of purchase of the loan portfolio to the current date, together with the forecast cash collections from the current date adjusted regularly in line with ERC based on the same assumptions and estimates, which together represent the entire actual and expected future Cash Collections on the investment portfolio. Gross IRR, as computed by us, may not be comparable to similar metrics used by other companies in our industry; - “Leverage,” which is calculated as Secured Net Debt over Adjusted EBITDA; - “Net Deal IRR,” which means a loan portfolio’s internal rate of return and is calculated using actual cash collections from date of purchase of the loan portfolio to the current date (net of servicing costs including servicing margin), together with the forecast cash collections from the current date adjusted regularly in line with ERC (net of servicing costs including servicing margin) based on the same assumptions and estimates, which together represent the entire actual and expected future Cash Collections (net of servicing costs including servicing margin) on the investment portfolio. Net Deal IRR, as computed by us, may not be comparable to similar metrics used by other companies in our industry; and ----- - “84-Month ERC” and “120-Month ERC” (together, “ERC”), which mean our estimated remaining Balance Sheet Cash Collections on portfolio investments over an 84-month or 120-month period, respectively, representing the expected future Balance Sheet Cash Collections on portfolio investments over an 84-month or 120-month period (calculated at the end of each month, based on our proprietary ERC forecasting model, as amended from time to time). 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC are calculated as of a point in time assuming no additional purchases are made thereafter. 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC are metrics that are also often used by other companies in our industry. 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC, as computed by us, may not be comparable to similar metrics used by other companies in our industry. We present 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC because they represent an estimate of the cash value of our portfolio investments at any point in time, which is an important supplemental measure for our Board and management to assess our performance, and underscores the cash generation capacity of the assets backing our business. We use 120-Month ERC in addition to 84-Month ERC to reflect the longer-term nature of our collections because of our high share of financial services assets, combined with our large proportion of Paying Accounts. Under the Indenture, ERC will be calculated based on projected collections from Portfolio Assets, which in turn includes a range of receivables included within the definition of Underlying Portfolio Assets. These Underlying Portfolio Assets may be held directly by us, or could be held by third parties. Specifically, we include within Portfolio Assets (i) Underlying Portfolio Assets owned directly by the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries (whether such direct ownership is in whole or in part), (ii) Underlying Portfolio Assets held by third parties as to which we have rights to collect and retain amounts generated by such Underlying Portfolio Assets (defined in the Indenture as Rights to Collect) and (iii) Underlying Portfolio Assets held by third parties as to which we have contractual rights or other rights to amounts generated by such Underlying Portfolio Assets (defined in the Indenture as Rights to Participate). Rights to Participate cover a range of rights to share in pools or other aggregations of receivables (based on negotiated percentages) that we do not own directly or through equity interests. See “Description of the Notes.” 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC are projections of our estimated remaining collections over an 84 month-period or a 120-month period, respectively, calculated by our proprietary ERC forecasting model, which uses our historical portfolio collection performance data, and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve such collections. Further, we constantly refine our methods for calculating 84-Month ERC and 120Month ERC. The balance sheet value of our portfolio investments is derived from the same proprietary ERC forecasting model used to derive 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC. The actual collection periods used for balance sheet valuation are not fixed at 84 or 120 months and vary based on our view of portfolio characteristics. Accordingly, there are differences between the cash flow projections used to calculate 84-Month ----- ERC and 120-Month ERC and those used in the calculation of balance sheet values of portfolio investments. Our computation of 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC could in the future differ from the collection forecasts used to compute and record our portfolio investments on our balance sheet. The non-IFRS measures and other information presented in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared for information purposes only and have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP or any other internationally accepted accounting principles or audited or reviewed in accordance with any applicable auditing standards. These non-IFRS measures and other information are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative or substitute measures to evaluate our performance. You should not consider the foregoing items as alternatives or substitutes to comparable IFRS measures. Moreover, these measures and related ratios: - have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation; - are not measures of our financial performance or liquidity under IFRS; - should not be considered as alternatives to net cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of our liquidity derived in accordance with IFRS; - should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to profit/(loss) after tax or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS; - may not be indicative of our results of operations; and - do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash requirements. In addition, these measures, as we define them, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or otherwise. You should exercise caution in comparing these measures as reported by us to such measures of other companies. We present the non-IFRS measures and other information (i) as they are used by our management to monitor and report to the board on financial position and (ii) to present similar measures that are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of financial position, financial performance and liquidity. We believe these non-IFRS measures and other information enhance the investor’s understanding of our indebtedness and our ability to fund our ongoing operations, make capital expenditures and meet and service our obligations, including our obligations under the Notes. The non-IFRS measures and other information are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. However, these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and other risks and may differ materially from our actual financial condition ----- or results of operations. The non-IFRS measures and other information presented in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling. Figures expressed in currencies other than pounds sterling have been converted at the relevant exchange rate applicable as of the date of the balance sheet included in such Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, certain measures in this Offering Memorandum are presented on a constant exchange rate basis to enhance their comparability period-to-period. To calculate such measures on a constant exchange rate basis, we have adjusted the prior period item such that the foreign currency conversion applied to that item is made using the same exchange rate as was applied to that item in the current period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"Established in 2005, we are a leading European investor and asset manager of debt in the non-performing and non-core assets sector, principally operating in the UK, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy and the Republic of Ireland (“Ireland”). As of June 30, 2021, we had £4.8 billion of FUM, £1,028 million in portfolio investments, £1,572 million 84-month ERC, £1,733 million 120-month ERC, and, in the six months ended June 30, 2021, generated Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the amount of £90.7 million. We operate as an integrated asset manager, a unique model with three operating divisions that provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. See “Business—Our businesses” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our _Business Model.” Our model focuses on generating higher levels of capital-light revenue and, as_ such, is a comparatively less capital-intensive model than many other businesses that operate in our sector. Our three operating divisions are detailed below: 1. _Fund and Investment Management: Our Fund and Investment Management business invests third-party committed capital on behalf of our clients and includes the management of our inaugural discretionary closed-end fund, Arrow Credit Opportunities (the “Fund”), with total capital commitments of €1.7 billion, together with Norfin, Europa Investimenti and Sagitta; 2. _Asset Management and Servicing: Our Asset Management and Servicing platforms service and manage collections and other activities related to portfolio investments, on behalf of both our Fund and Investment Management business and our Balance Sheet business, as well as third-party clients. We have built market-leading positions, niche-dominant platforms and competitive servicing platforms, with expertise in consumer, real estate, mortgage and SME non-performing loans (“NPLs”) and non-core asset servicing across the five jurisdictions in which we operate; and 3. _Balance Sheet: Our Balance Sheet business invests our own capital. Since the deployment of the Fund in 2020, our investments have typically been made by way of a co-investment alongside the Fund, via a 100% owned Jersey partnership, Arrow Global SMA I LP (“Arrow SMA”). Going forward, we expect the Balance Sheet business to function primarily for the purpose of co-investment activities alongside the Fund as well as any future funds. We may, however, continue to make ----- direct investments through this business for certain strategic reasons. The Balance Sheet business also incorporates the financial performance of the back book portfolio investments made prior to the launch of the Fund. Our businesses provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. Our Fund and Investment Management business, benefiting from our 15-year track record of delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns, invests on behalf of our Balance Sheet business, with typically 25% coinvestment in new portfolio investments alongside the Fund, and approximately 71% of these portfolio investments are currently serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing platforms. We identify, acquire and service a wide range of secured and unsecured defaulted and noncore loan and real estate portfolios primarily from financial institutions, such as banks, institutional fund investors and specialist lenders, playing an active role in helping financial institutions reduce their balance sheets and re-capitalize in order to increase mainstream lending. By purchasing and managing NPLs and other non-core assets, we provide valuable capital and expertise to a growing European market. Our purpose is to help build better financial futures for our customers, clients, communities, employees and other stakeholders. As such, great importance is placed on achieving fair outcomes for customers through affordable repayment programs and helping them improve their credit score. We believe that we are one of the leading providers of debt purchase and receivables management solutions in the territories in which we operate. Through our platforms we have developed local knowledge of acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets. We offer a differentiated and diversified European NPL strategy by leveraging our deep local expertise across the five key European jurisdictions in which we operate. Our relevant track record and experience having operated in each of our core markets for a long time as well as our familiarity with each asset class provides us with a competitive advantage that is supported by local and experienced “on-the-ground” teams. In addition, our presence in these jurisdictions enables us to target smaller transactions in more sophisticated granular assets where local knowledge provides a competitive advantage and supports the creation of relationships with debt originators, enabling origination of off-market deals (i.e., deals not acquired through a process involving a competitive bid or an auction-like process). Our ability to meet our targets and deliver consistently high IRR on our portfolio investments is premised on several factors including our experienced investment professionals, our local expertise in acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets, our strong origination capabilities with broad reach enabling us to acquire a high level of off-market deals and our leading data analytics capabilities. Our proprietary database incorporates more than 15 years of collection and payment data, over 1,000 deals underwritten since our inception, 10 million customer accounts and over 10,000 of underlying properties across multiple geographies. As we accelerate our movement towards a capital-light strategy, which focuses more on the growth of the Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses, and less on our Balance Sheet business, this will result in a change in our financial characteristics. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Our Business Model.”_ ----- As part of this shift, it is our intention that our integrated fund manager business model delivers: - an increase in FUM, with a similar or reduced level of portfolio investments held by our Balance Sheet business; - an increase in the proportion of the earnings of the business derived from our capital light businesses; - an ability to target higher return on capital invested through a reduced use of our own balance sheet to provide returns; and - an increase in cash generation as capital-light revenues grow and less cash is required for re-investment in our own balance sheet assets, with a concomitant ability to delever the business. To support our transition to a capital-light strategy, we will leverage our strong track record and experience in working with partners through our historic co-investments as well as our longstanding relationships with many of the largest institutional investors in the market. The Fund represented the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally in 2020, the third largest credit fundraise in special situations globally in 2020 and the fourth largest private credit fundraise in Europe. Our track record of generating superior returns during economic dislocation combined with LP investors’ demand for private debt strategies provides a strong platform to continue to raise private funds for yield-seeking investors and our transition into a more profitable capitallight model.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Key Strengths,9.2.1,Attractive market with strong growth drivers.,"We are a leading European investor and asset manager in the non-performing and non-core assets sector principally operating in the UK, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy and Ireland, with a 15-year track record of delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns. Debt originators generally use debt sales as a method for managing the economic, regulatory and commercial aspects of continued ownership of defaulted loans and non-core assets and to accelerate capital release for debts that are already fully or heavily provisioned. The debt purchase and debt servicing industry is a significant component of the debt recovery process in many markets and provides an attractive solution for debt originators facing increasing capital and liquidity regulatory requirements, thereby ultimately benefiting customers. See “Industry—The _debt collection and debt servicing market.” Our business model is designed to benefit from_ economic dislocation, which leads to an increase in the generation of non-performing and noncore assets. Even prior to the recent economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our addressable market was very large, at approximately €1.0 trillion. Over half of these assets still sit on bank balance sheets and will need to be sold in due course into the capital markets, where the largest investors are often distressed debt funds. See “Industry—Market participants” and ----- “Industry—Alternative investment management—Market participants: fund and asset managers.” Although these assets are created continually, the rise in the level of NPLs is closely tied to periods of economic downturn. This trend was evident following the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008, where an extremely large number of NPLs were created. The economic dislocation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is already resulting in historically high bank provisioning for bad loans, which we expect will begin to be sold in significant volumes in the coming years. See “Industry—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic” Our current internal forecast, based on our analysis of bank provisions and forecast defaults, suggests to us that the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to an increase of approximately 50% in our addressable market. This equates to approximately €500 billion of additional NPLs having been or being created on bank balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the non performing exposures (“NPE”) volume in EU banks (including the UK) decreased to €528 billion (compared to €584 billion in December 2019), with the year over year drop primarily driven by a significant increase in the support measures implemented to soften the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. NPL transaction activity was muted during 2020, marking a slowdown from previous years (total transaction activity of €77.8 billion, down 35% compared to 2019 and down 62% compared to 2018). We believe the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will increase transaction activity in 2021, which will in turn create new market opportunities. ECB 2020 stress tests suggest that NPLs levels could reach €1.4 trillion once COVID-19 related financial relief measures are withdrawn (as compared to a €1.2 trillion peak in 2015). See “ Industry—The European NPL _market.” Further, our presence within some of the largest European NPL jurisdictions, being Italy, UK, the Netherlands, Portugal and Ireland, puts us in a position to benefit from what we believe will be the greatest market prospect for non-performing assets since the global financial crisis in 2007/2008. The volume of NPLs in our primary markets is significant, as illustrated below: _Sources: Company information, ECB, EBA Risk Dashboard, Deloitte and KPMG market reports on European NPL market._ Prior to the current economic dislocation, European banks’ NPL ratios had only just begun to approach the levels targeted by the European Banking Authority (“EBA”) and the ECB. This had followed significant regulatory pressure for banks to recognize impaired assets and subsequently deleverage on an expedited basis. The result was a period of transformational European bank balance sheet restructuring that led to over €700 billion of assets being sold from bank balance sheets into the capital markets. We anticipate that the wave of new non-performing assets that is projected to be created following the current COVID-19-related economic dislocation will continue to mean that regulation is likely to prioritize bank deleveraging, resulting in another large wave of non-performing asset sales in the coming years. See “Industry—The impact of the ----- _COVID-19 pandemic.” In addition to presenting investment opportunities, increased deleveraging_ by European banks is also expected to present significant asset servicing opportunities for our Asset Management and Servicing business, which we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of. See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—Specialization and _standardization.”_ The overall declining trend in total EU NPL volumes during 2020 has been driven by the relief measures adopted to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the period since the COVID-19 pandemic began, €900 billion of European loans received support through EBA-eligible moratoria. Our forward outlook is foreseen by the increase in Stage 2 loans (9.1% in December 2020 as compared to 6.5% in December 19). The proportion of Stage 2 loans under moratoria is 26.4%, emphasizing the potential downside risks once the moratoria expire. The chart below illustrates the large proportion of non-expired Stage 2 loans under moratoria. _Sources: EBA Risk Dashboard, KPMG Navigating European distressed markets - European debt sales 2021, Deloitte, Deleveraging Europe June 2021._ When government measures and moratoria come to an end, even a subset of these loans souring to NPL would cause banks to face a significant challenge, with a material rise in NPLs volumes, thereby creating market opportunities for new contract wins and investments. According to market consensus, the new flows will push banks to react with significant and prompt disposal processes, with the aim of remaining in line with their NPL maximum holding levels. According to PwC’s July 2021 report on the Italian NPL Market, up to €100 billion of distressed credits are expected to flow in the next 24-30 months in Italy alone, one of the largest NPL markets in Europe and one of our key markets. We are also highly active in the growing secondary market including purchasing NPLs and other non-core assets already serviced by our own platforms. Asset sales to NPL and other noncore asset buyers have grown dramatically in recent years in our key markets, suggesting a large secondary market. A typical non-performing asset portfolio has a long life, with cash collections often generated for over ten years. The majority of the over €700 billion of assets that have been sold by European banks in recent years have been purchased by large distressed asset funds. These asset funds are the largest buyers of non-performing assets in the market. Non-performing assets ----- are typically held in a closed-end fund structure and then sold at the end of that fund’s life. Based on our analysis of previous transactions in the market, we estimate that an additional €300 billion of NPLs will be generated in the market over the next four years. A large number of these NPLs already sit on our servicing platforms, providing us with a unique pipeline of potential investment opportunities, the performance of which can be forecast with a degree of certainty. This greatly enhances risk-adjusted returns should we elect to purchase such assets, which we often do. Our significant estimated secondary sale market in our geographies is illustrated in the chart below. _Sources: Company data; PwC, Deloitte and KPMG market reports on European NPLs market._ Fundraising from LP investors is also an important dynamic for our development and our offering is highly attractive to the growing number of LP investors looking to allocate to private debt. In fact, approximately 81% of the LP investors surveyed indicated that they expected to increase their allocation to alternative investments, including private debt strategies, to more than double the current levels over the next five years from 2% to 5%, according to a 2020 Preqin article regarding the future of alternatives in 2025. Our 2020 fundraise of the Fund represented one of the more successful fundraises of 2020, with the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally, third largest credit fundraise in special situations globally and fourth largest private equity fundraise in Europe. See “Industry—Alternative investment management.” The fundraising took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which created various operational issues, including, among others, that LP investors were unable to conduct in-person due diligence in respect of the Fund Manager. However, despite these unprecedented operational hurdles, we successfully facilitated interactions with over 100 LP investors throughout the Fund’s fundraising process and we believe that such interactions have led to the formation of a strong pipeline of potential LP investors for future fundraising. There is also an increasing propensity for banks and other debt originators to outsource their arrears or defaulted accounts collection activities which are not considered a core competency for them. See “See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—Specialization and _standardization.” However, collection activities remain a core competency for our Asset_ Management and Servicing business. This shift to outsourcing collection activities has increased given the COVID-19 pandemic and is an additional market development that we believe will be beneficial for our Asset Management and Servicing business. Throughout 2020, we secured a ----- record 26 new contract wins, a further 11 new contracts in the first half of 2021 and we believe that we are well placed to win further new third-party contracts as a servicing partner to financial institutions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Key Strengths,9.2.2,Strong track record of being a leading European investor and asset manager.,"We have a strong track record of delivering superior returns, even during periods of economic dislocation, which has provided us with the strong platform to transition to our integrated asset manager model and raise funds from yield-seeking LP investors in the Fund. We believe that the following five factors have been critical in establishing our track record of delivering high IRR on our portfolio investments: - our people with significant experience and a deep bench of management experience; - local know-how of acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets; - strong origination capabilities with broad reach allowing us to acquire a high level of off-market deals; - leading data analytics capabilities, which enable us to underwrite portfolios with accuracy; and - experience in capital partnering where we have regularly partnered with third-party funds as a minority investor. Our track record has delivered a 17% Net Deal IRR since 2010 (despite the ERC write down as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic), including the track record of acquired businesses. Our performance by vintage year, shown in the chart below, has driven the results of our Balance Sheet business and also presents a compelling risk/return proposition for LP investors with consistent outperformance against relevant benchmarks, such as the high yield index, as illustrated below: _Source: Company information._ Our differentiated origination strategy targets high levels of off-market deals, leveraging off of our strong local presence and the ability to provide asset expertise on a granular basis. During 2020, based on our calculations, 74% of our total deals were acquired off-market, where deals tend ----- to be smaller (€5 to €40 million investments) and typically deliver higher returns. Such opportunities are only generated from our deep market connections and experienced in-country NPL and non-core asset operational teams. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Portfolio investments.” The benefit of our differentiated origination strategy is_ illustrated by the chart below, showing an incremental 5% increase to the Net Deal IRR of off-market deals (18% as of June 30, 2021) compared to on-market transactions (13% as of June 30, 2021) executed through competitive tender processes. Our track record was impacted by the ERC write down in the first half of 2020 with an overall 2% reduction in the average Net Deal IRR (all deals since 2010) from December 2019 to December 2020. However, the recovery is already underway, driven by the over-performance in actual collections against the ERC and the returns achieved on more recent vintages has already led to a 1% Net Deal IRR recovery. _Source: Company information and internal calculations._ Furthermore, we have strong actual cash realization, and therefore, we have demonstrable evidence that our actual cash collections performance is in line with our underwriting assumptions at the current point in time. As of June 30, 2020, we had realized above 100% of expected cash receipts, per our underwriting curves, in eight out of twelve years (i.e., 2010 to 2021). Our 2017 vintage had two large underperforming deals as a result of collection challenges caused by the counterparty’s bankruptcy and systems integration challenges and our 2018 and 2019 vintages have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in court closures and therefore impacted our ability to make cash collections. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” However, given the over-performance against_ the current forecast ERC, there is opportunity for recovery of these vintages over time. Notably, the 2020 and 2021 vintages show strong cash recovery of 230% and 296% respectively. The strong performance of our vintages is illustrated by the chart below. ----- ----- As mentioned above and exhibited in the graphic below, we have demonstrated consistent growth of collections and Adjusted EBITDA, with only a slowdown in 2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic. _Source: Company information._",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Key Strengths,9.2.3,Integrated asset manager is a unique model not replicated by other market participants.,"Following the establishment of our Fund Manager and the raising of the Fund, we have transitioned to an integrated asset manager model, which we believe is unique in our market and enables our three businesses: the Fund and Investment Management, Asset Management and Servicing and Balance Sheet to operate synergistically. Our Fund and Investment Management business originates new investment opportunities, that our Balance Sheet business can co-invest into and our Asset Management and Servicing business can then service. We expect our Balance Sheet business to continue to co-invest alongside fund investments, with a participation of 25% for the Fund and a lower participation, approximately 10%, for subsequent funds. Our Asset Management and Servicing business currently services 71% of the Fund’s investments and the Fund pays market referenced fees for such services. The integrated asset manager model enables us to increase capital-light income, through management and performance fees generated by our Fund and Investment Management business and asset management and servicing fees delivered by our Asset Management and Servicing business. We believe that there are two fundamental benefits to our integrated asset manager model. Firstly, we can invest at scale and further build our considerable intellectual property of investing in our chosen markets and secondly, the increase in capital-light earnings will in due course fundamentally improve our financial profile. Investing at scale allows us to further build intellectual property through building origination capabilities through broadening and deepening relationships with Investment Portfolio Sellers and extending our reach to source off-market deals. In turn, the increased level of portfolios purchased enriches and builds our data and data analytical capabilities, leading to increased accuracy of underwriting and pricing portfolios. The increased scale is an enabler to create operational leverage within our platforms in our Asset Management and Servicing business, allowing returns to be maximized. Strong returns build our capital-light earnings, enable ----- deleveraging and increase the appetite from LP investors to commit financing to our subsequent funds, enabling the growth of our Fund Manager with the ability to further grow and increase the scale of our businesses. Furthermore, our integrated asset manager model drives an improved financial risk profile, given the increase in capital-light earnings generated. The increase in the level of capital-light revenues generated for each investment drives a materially different return on capital employed. The charts below show the indicative returns for a typical balance sheet investor with a Net Deal IRR of 18%, before any overhead allocation versus the indicative returns for us under our integrated asset manager model, showing the build of returns driven by the capital-light revenues, as well as the indicative returns, pre-overheads, for us of between 25% (based upon our current 25% co-investment participation) and 40% (based upon the expected approximately 10% coinvestment participation for subsequent funds). _Source: Company information._ We expect to be able to increase income generated through management and performance fees charged to LP investors while increasing scale benefits to the Asset Management and Servicing business through more increased and stable servicing income. We believe that the gradual build-up of management fees, primarily fees charged on drawn capital, will grow a stable revenue source with future funds. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our EBITDA from our capital-light businesses was 33% of our total EBITDA. Given the losses sustained during 2020, our capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA was negative 48.4%, but after adjusting for the non-cash write off of ERC in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic of £133.6 million, our capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA would have been 19.0%. Our capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA (pre-Acquisition costs) was 22.5% for the six months period ended June 30, 2021. The decrease since 2019 primarily reflects the investment in the fund management infrastructure, which will, in due course generate higher income as FUM continue to grow. We expect, but cannot guarantee, that the returns on capital, the build of capital-light revenues and the reduced level of purchases by our Balance Sheet business (we expect to reduce our co-investment participation in future funds, including ACO 2, to approximately 10% from the current 25%) will enable us to de-lever, reduce Net Debt and, in time, materially change our financial risk profile. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Key Strengths,9.2.4,Differentiated origination capability supported by local platforms.,"Our Fund and Investment Management business has a differentiated approach from other institutional fund managers in the market. Based on our knowledge of the market, the majority of credit funds have a small team based in international capital centers and access the NPL and noncore asset market by mainly targeting large bank asset auctions of greater than €100 million. On the other hand, as highlighted in the chart below, our model is predicated on leveraging our large local presence in each of our markets, with local asset servicing businesses providing deep asset expertise on a granular basis, to form strong relationships with potential asset sellers and develop a detailed knowledge of a wide range of asset classes on a granular level. Our model has enabled us to consistently make more of our investments in non-competitive, off-market bi-lateral trades that are smaller in size and offer higher returns. _Note: Prepared based on Company information and estimates._ Our compelling proposition is highlighted by the Fund’s support from a diversified range of sophisticated LP investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth, university endowments and family offices, with global commitments ranging from the UK, Benelux, Nordics, Germany, Switzerland, the East Coast of the U.S., the West Coast of the U.S., Canada, Australia and Asia. Further, through our fundraising, we have had interactions with over 100 LP investors creating a very strong pipeline of potential investors for future fundraises. Furthermore, our Asset Management and Servicing business has market-leading platforms and is well placed to capitalize on growth opportunities. Our businesses undertake a broad range of services, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization and litigation and court process management, master servicing activities, such as legal title holding, securitization vehicle management activities and other activities such as due diligence, onboarding and new origination. We also provide debt collection and servicing to many of the large institutional global and European debt funds. See “Business—Our businesses—Asset Management _and Servicing business.” Our combination of market leading positions, niche dominant platforms_ ----- and competitive specialist servicing and investment platforms across five markets position us as a local operator with expertise in real estate, mortgage, SME and consumer NPL servicing. We achieved a record of 26 contract wins in 2020, with a further 11 new contract wins during the first half of 2021, one of which being our acquisition of the collections and recoveries operations within Tesco Bank’s Customer Service division. This partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced service to customers in financial difficulty by providing the necessary support and flexibility they will need in the future. Tesco Bank chose to partner with us because of our focus on customers, proven expertise, technology platform and the cultural alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The partnership is expected to result in over 200 of Tesco Bank’s personnel transferring over to us on November 1, 2021. We have observed an increasing need for our services from banks such as Tesco Bank given the pressure on their operations as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market— _Specialization and standardization.” The increasing use of digital mediums, with portals for self-_ service by customers, increases in our customer satisfaction scores ― we have seen an increase by 0.3 in our customer satisfaction scores, averaging 7.7 (out of 9) in 2020 ― and embedded forbearance and vulnerable customer policies and processes have facilitated our growth and are a key factor in the industry awards that our platforms received in 2020. Our market-leading platforms deliver significant levels of third party contract wins which are backed up by the recognition we have received through awards and customer satisfaction. Most notably, in 2020 we were awarded the Credit Strategy ‘Best Outsourcing and Partnership’ Initiative for Onboarding and Customer Engagement, in recognition of our work with Virgin Money. Additionally, in November 2020 we became four time finalists after being nominated at the Credit Strategy Collections and Customer Service Awards. In Portugal, in 2020, our business was recognized not only as a Top Employer but accredited as the Best Credit Portfolio Management Company (Global Banking and Finance Review), Best Asset Management Servicer (International Investor) and Best Practice Operator of the Year (ACQ5, Country Awards 2020).",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, our Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation was £156.6 million and £90.7 million respectively. The build of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow is illustrated in the chart below. _Source: Company information._ ----- Furthermore, we retain flexibility on the level of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow that we reinvest in new portfolio acquisitions and, as such, are able to manage any peaks and troughs in liquidity requirements. This is evidenced by the fact that during 2020 the portfolio investments that we made amounted to £109.9 million, compared with £303.7 million during 2019, as we sought to conserve liquidity, given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we develop our capital-light businesses, we expect to reduce the level of re-investment in new portfolio acquisitions and, as such, we expect that a portion of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation will support Net Debt reduction and deleveraging. We are targeting £500 million Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation, after investment in new portfolios acquisitions for the period 2021–2025, which target we are not guaranteed to meet within the planned time frame or at all. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This _Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_ As exhibited in the chart below, our balance sheet has both geographical and asset class diversification. As of June 30, 2021, our 84 month ERC in the jurisdictions in which we operate were as follows: 36% in the UK, 26% in Portugal, 21% in Italy, 15% in the Netherlands and 2% in Ireland and, as of the same date, 66% was unsecured and 34% secured. This diversification, together with the limited deal size of any single portfolio investment, minimizes our risk profile. _Source: Company information._ Furthermore, as a result of the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our conservative non-cash write down of 13.2% to our ERC as of June 30, 2020, reflected the significant uncertainty at that time arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and is reflective of our cautious approach. Details of the ERC write-down are shown in the graphic below. ----- _Source: Company information._ However, as illustrated in the charts below, we are performing well against our ERC. This creates a significant value upside - on the basis of an 84-month ERC of £1.6 billion, a 5% overperformance in actual collections equates to an approximate upside of £50 million after discounting.

Their track-record of proven success places us in a position to expand upon our robust market position. The full support of our incumbent senior management and their strategic targets, increased capital-light earnings and reduced capital intensity, all increase our prospects of growth whilst also reducing leverage under the new ownership of TDR Capital. Our goal of reducing leverage will be bolstered by TDR ----- Capital’s commitment to reduce leverage (with a target of leverage being approximately 3.0 - 3.5 times by 2023) without compromising our existing risk appetite. TDR Capital is a leading specialist buyout firm with total FUM of approximately €10 billion as of December 31, 2020 and is based in the UK. It was founded in 2002 by Manjit Dale and Stephen Robertson, who were previously partners at DB Capital Partners. For further details, see “Principal Shareholders.” TDR Capital has an experienced team of investment professionals and operating partners and a longstanding historical focus on financial services and business services, as evidenced by its March 2016 investment in LeasePlan, the world’s leading fleet management and driver mobility company. TDR Capital has a low-volume investment strategy (one to two investments per year) based on principles developed by the investment team over the past decade. TDR Capital seeks to spend significant resources on each investment and to focus on operational excellence through a tested and integrated operating partner model. TDR Capital will provide operational best practices and fund management expertise accrued through almost 20 years of pan-European investing and understand the structures and culture required to enable our integrated asset manager model to thrive. TDR Capital has a strong track record in the financial services industry, including specialty finance, leasing and insurance. For example, TDR Capital helped oversee the growth of Lowell Group, a debt purchaser of unsecured debt, as its owner from 2011 until 2015, and developed an in-depth understanding of the value drivers and regulation relevant to the industry. TDR Capital has continued to actively monitor the credit management industry and has closely followed our journey in public markets to date, and believes that our team has successfully created a high quality, internationally diverse, vertically integrated asset manager and fully supports management’s clear ambition to further develop our capital-light based strategy. We believe that access to their deep and trusted LP relationships and capital under TDR Capital ownership will provide the flexibility required to expedite the development of our Fund and Investment Management business and be instrumental in accelerating our further transition to our capital-light model and deleveraging.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

As such, we seek to allocate capital, through our investments in portfolios, depending on the prevailing market and economic environment, in order to maximize the risk-adjusted returns within overall risk appetite and concentration limits. Our capital deployment for both our Balance Sheet business and the Fund has been strong through 2021. However, given the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment, we have remained cautious in our approach to pricing and underwriting investment opportunities. Deployment has focused more on off-market real estate and special situation investments with shorter weighted average life, rather than unsecured investments that tend to have a longer weighted average life. This approach to capital deployment allows us to achieve target returns whilst seeking to minimize the risk profile of our investments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Our focus on ESG is firmly embedded in our purpose and culture and we believe this focus will drive better operational outcomes. We recognize the importance of ESG for our stakeholders. The holders of the Notes, our shareholders and LP investors recognize the importance and value of investing in responsible businesses delivering sustainable returns. Our regulators require assurance over our policies, processes and practices and will act against firms that are non-compliant. Our customers expect to receive fair outcomes, whilst portfolio sellers and third-party asset management clients often require assurance that their customers will be handled responsibly and therefore, acting responsibly is increasingly becoming a competitive advantage. Also, our people want to work for a good corporate citizen. The primary focus of the social leg of our ESG strategy is ensuring fair customer treatment, which was particularly relevant throughout the COVID-19 pandemic where forbearance and vulnerable customer policies were critical in our support of our customers. Furthermore, we significantly curtailed litigation during the COVID-19 pandemic, as we believe that acting responsibly delivers better long term returns for all our stakeholders. In particular, our customer satisfaction levels rose during 2020, throughout such a difficult period for many of our customers. We expect to vertically re-align our governance by empowering our local champion platforms with local accountability under a fund manager framework. This framework will, we believe, deliver greater accountability and improve performance. Furthermore, we aim to maintain our commitment to diversity and inclusion among our people, in order to build a human-centric workplace and provide a positive work environment, supporting a diversity of working styles and appealing to a wider talent pool whilst retaining talented people who want autonomy and choice. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated our support for our people to help keep them safe with 100% of our staff fully operational and working from home by the end of March ----- 2020. Lastly, the environmental leg of our ESG strategy involves our focus on the evolution and development of our internal policies and due diligence standards, coupled with our ambition of net-zero carbon dioxide emissions.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Recent Developments,9.4.1,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China, rapidly spreading to nearly all regions around the world, including the UK and Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Italy, which caused the World Health Organization to declare COVID ----- 19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In order to prevent the spread of the virus, governments around the world implemented several measures, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines and self-isolations for infected people, business slowdowns or shutdowns, and encouraging or requiring people to avoid large gatherings. For example, in response to the COVID19 pandemic, on March 23, 2020, the UK government imposed a nationwide quarantine together with several other measures. As a result of these restrictive measures across all the countries in which we operate, we closed substantially all of our offices and transitioned all of our employees to remote working. Whilst restrictions have eased at times – for example the nationwide quarantine in the UK was lifted on May 10, 2020 – significant restrictions and social distancing measures have remained in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall economies of the countries in which we operate and, in turn, our operations and our customers’ operations. For instance, court closures and various legal and regulatory measures intended to help debtors, such as moratoria on certain collection or enforcement activities, along with a slowdown in the real estate market, heavily impacted our ability to make collections during this period. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to prevent a further spread, our business was impacted globally in 2020 by the temporary closure and restrictions as a consequence of the guidelines given by the respective governments of the countries where we operate. Collections performance is a critical factor for our business and the COVID-19 pandemic led to disruptions in our cash collection performance, as a result of a deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, changes to our customers’ financial circumstances and lockdown measures implemented in the countries in which we operate, resulting in court closures and impacting the business’s ability to litigate and operate as normal. Our cash collections during the three months ended March 31, 2020 were £85.0 million, representing 92% of ERC with the only material shortfall relating to £10 million of delayed collections from two large secured assets in Italy and Ireland. However, we started to see the early signs of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during March 2020 and our collections performance weakened in April 2020 with secured collections, impacted by lockdown and court closures to 78% of ERC, enhanced by the acceleration of cash flows from the restructuring of one of the Group’s co-investment portfolios. During this period, unsecured collections stabilized at 74% of ERC. Excluding the collection acceleration, cash collections for April 2020 settled at 75% of ERC. Approximately 34% of the Group’s ERC is derived from secured portfolios – primarily in Portugal and Italy – where cash collections are often driven either by the local court system or result from the completion of real estate sales. Whilst both of these collection strategies were directly impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions imposed by European governments, secured portfolios are backed by underlying assets and therefore, the timing of cash collections can be impacted, together with the quantum in the event of real estate price decreases. The majority of the remaining 66% of the Group’s ERC consists of unsecured assets – primarily in the UK, followed by Portugal and the Netherlands – where collections are driven by smaller, more frequent monthly cash collections. Automated collections form approximately 46% of total Group collections and approximately 87% of Northern European (the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands) unsecured collections. Where unsecured collections are not automated, they are substantially all paid by remote electronic means. Collections started to recover in May 2020 from the low in April, with secured collections at 62% of ERC and unsecured at 85% of ERC. Collections during the three months ended March ----- 31, 2020 were £85.0 million, representing 92% of ERC, and during the six months ended June 30, 2020 were £175.7 million, representing 91% of ERC. Our financial response to the collections weakness was proactive and we strengthened our liquidity position in the first half of 2020 demonstrating our ability to manage liquidity, in particular through the curtailment of investments in new portfolio acquisitions and the suspension of shareholder dividends. Cash and cash equivalents improved by £77.0 million to £165.8 million from December 31, 2019 to June 30, 2020 with decisive action on cost and working capital as well as acceleration of collections to make up for COVID-19 induced collection weakness and reduced portfolio purchases of £42.9 million (six months ended June 30, 2019: £165.6 million). Furthermore, we raised additional funds in July 2020 through the execution of a €104.7 million asset backed amortizing loan and completed a long-term support agreement with our bank lenders at that time, recognizing that short term leverage would increase above previous covenant levels as the impact of lower collections built over the following twelve months. As a result of our cautious view on the macroeconomic environment at that time, we reforecast our ERC at June 30, 2020, resulting in a non-cash write down to portfolio investments on the balance sheet of £133.6 million and an operating loss of £108.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 (six months ended June 30, 2019: £59.0 million of operating profit). During the third quarter of 2020, we saw an improving cash collections trend. Whilst the easing of lockdown measures and the development of a vaccine have potentially lessened the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment, we remained cautious. Collections in the third quarter 2020 were £85.1 million representing 141% of the revised ERC, and were partially driven by a catch-up in secured collections from earlier in the year. The collections performance continued to be better than we predicted, with £78.1 million of collections in the fourth quarter of 2020. Collections for the full year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to £338.9 million (2019: £442.3 million), with collections during the six months ended December 31, 2020 representing 125% of revised ERC. Collections performance has continued to remain robust in 2021, with collections in the first quarter of 2021 of £76.9 million (first quarter of 2020: £85.0 million) representing 106% of ERC and in the second quarter of 2021 of £102.7 million (second quarter of 2020: £90.7 million) representing 131% of ERC. Collections during the six months ended June 30, 2021 were £179.6 million, representing 119% of December 2020 ERC. Overall, we have had a strong second quarter with our 2021 second quarter stand-alone results, with our profit before tax being 1.9 times greater than our first quarter in 2021. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, we had a profit before tax and takeover costs of £22.9 million (loss of £135.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020), with £22.4 million of Acquisition costs recognized and, together with the strong collections performance, this had a beneficial impact on our leverage levels with our leverage for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 decreasing by 0.4 times from 5.1 times. While the impact to our business has been significant, the wider dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on borrowers has also been significant. Following the global financial crisis in 2008, NPLs in the European financial systems peaked at approximately €1.2 trillion. While NPLs had decreased to roughly half of that figure by the end of 2019, stress tests on banks by the ECB suggest that NPLs could reach a new peak at roughly €1.4 trillion as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented economic and social challenges. Whilst we have not yet experienced an increase in the willingness of Investment Portfolio Sellers to sell ----- defaulted debt, we expect that during late 2021 and into 2022, market activity will increase, potentially leading to an increase in the volume of portfolios that we are able to acquire.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

For a summary of debt obligations identified in this diagram, see “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description _of the Notes.”_ (1) The Notes will be issued under the Indenture. See “Description of the Notes.” On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior basis by the Parent, Finco and Bidco. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Re-Registration Date, and in any case no later than 120 days after the Re-Registration Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Target and certain material wholly owned subsidiaries of the Target. The Guarantors will also guarantee on a senior basis the Revolving Facility and certain hedging obligations and certain operating facilities, if any. (2) From the Issue Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and certain other conditions, the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by certain security granted in favor of the Security Agent, including (i) a limited recourse English law share charge over all shares held by Midco in the Parent and security assignment of intercompany loans owed by the Parent to Midco and (ii) an English law debenture granted by each of the Parent, Finco, Bidco and the Issuer granting fixed and floating security over substantially all of the assets of the Parent, Finco, Bidco and the Issuer, as further described in “Description of the Notes—Security.” As soon as reasonably practicable after the Re-Registration Date, and in any case no later than 120 days after the Re-Registration Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes and the Guarantees will also be secured by certain security granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors in favor of the Security Agent, including (1) an English law debenture over certain material assets of the Additional Guarantors that are incorporated in England and Wales, (2) comparable security for Additional Guarantors incorporated in Guernsey and Jersey, and (3) with respect to the Additional Guarantors incorporated in the Netherlands, security over (i) the material bank accounts of such Additional Guarantors, (ii) intraRestricted Group receivables, and (iii) shares owned by such Additional Guarantors in the Issuer or the other Guarantors. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations and certain operating facilities that are secured by the Collateral will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over the Collateral. The Collateral may be released in circumstances described in “Description of the Notes—Security.” ----- In the event of enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the lenders under the Revolving Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and certain operating facilities have been repaid in full. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Collateral may also secure additional debt in the future. As of the Issue Date, upon repayment of certain borrowings under the Revolving Facility, £55 million is expected to remain outstanding under the Revolving Facility. (3) The Group, comprising of the Parent and its subsidiaries, including the Issuer and the Target Group, are controlled by TDR Capital. TDR Capital indirectly holds 90.72% beneficial ownership and voting rights in the Parent and the Stub Equity Holders own 9.28% of the beneficial ownership and voting rights in the Parent. On October 11, 2021, Bidco, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, completed the Acquisition by way of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006. On or about October 15, 2021, investment funds managed or advised by TDR Capital, indirectly through Midco, by way of the Equity Contribution, provided an aggregate amount of £513 million to the Parent. Further, pursuant to the Alternative Offer, the 9.28% Stub Equity Holders of the Target also indirectly contributed £52 million of the equity of Bidco through their investment in Topco. (4) The Target Group has two non-recourse committed asset-backed securitization term loans, being the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility and the Euro Non-Recourse Facility. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding amount under the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility was £54.7 million and the outstanding amount under the Euro Non-Recourse Facility was €48.0 million. Further, certain entities in the Target Group are borrowers under the Miscellaneous Facilities. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding amounts under the Miscellaneous Facilities were £3.1 million. The indebtedness incurred under the Non-Recourse Facilities and the Miscellaneous Facilities will remain outstanding on the Issue Date. (5) Not all of the subsidiaries of the Parent will guarantee the Notes and the Revolving Facility. As of June 30, 2021, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the subsidiaries of the Parent that are not expected to guarantee the Notes would have had £101.5 million (equivalent) of third party debt outstanding consisting of amounts drawn under the Non-Recourse Sterling Facility, the Non-Recourse Euro Facility, the Miscellaneous Facilities and other borrowings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes _will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Permitted Purchase Obligations SPVs.”_ (6) Pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Issuer will provide the Proceeds Loan to Finco on or about the Issue Date and Finco will use the proceeds from the Proceeds Loan to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility, (a) certain of which was onlent to Bidco and was used by Bidco to finance the transaction costs in connection with the Transactions (other than the Offering of the Notes) and (b) certain of which was on-lent to the Target Group to repay and cancel the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility.

For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, additional Notes shall be deemed to form one series with any notes previously issued under the Indenture if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such other notes. In the event that any additional Notes issued after the date hereof and sold pursuant to Rule 144A are not fungible with ----- any notes previously issued under such Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such non-fungible additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such previously issued notes under such Indenture. Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the applicable series of notes previously issued under such Indenture without being fungible with such series of notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In the event additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer to BookEntry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any) representing Notes of that same series. Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes.

We have also presented certain information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, in order to facilitate a comparison of the Target Group’s results of operations for such periods with other periods presented. The information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, has been derived by subtracting the Target Group’s six months ended June 30, 2020, results of operations data from the Target Group’s results of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2020, and adding the Target Group’s results of operations data for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The Target Group’s results of operations for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. For further information on the basis of presentation of the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements, see “Presentation of Financial and Other _Information.” Certain of the Target Group’s subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries as of_ the Issue Date, but will be consolidated in the Parent’s consolidated financial statements for future periods. However, these Unrestricted Subsidiaries will remain outside of the Restricted Group. Further, the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been re-presented in the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The re-presentation relates to certain balance sheet items, including (i) the inclusion of £26.6 million of bank balances within cash and cash equivalents, that were previously shown within trade and other receivables (this cash balance may be subject to constraints regarding when the balance can be remitted, such as cash in a consolidated securitization structure awaiting a payment date); and (ii) the reclassification of £21.7 million from ‘other operating expenses’ to ‘collection activity and fund management costs’ as part of the change in the segmental reporting structure as a result of the Target Group now being managed through an integrated asset management model. The total impact on operating expenses as a result of the reclassification is nil. For further information on the re-presentation of the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations.” and_ “Summary—Summary Consolidated Historical Financial and Other Information.” We present below certain non-IFRS measures and ratios that are not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS, including Adjusted EBITDA, Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA and certain leverage and coverage ratios, among others. There can be no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as exceptional will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The non-IFRS measures are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS measures as presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures ----- used by other companies, and Adjusted EBITDA, Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA may each differ from consolidated EBITDA contained in “Description of the Notes” and that will be contained in the Indenture. The calculations for the non-IFRS measures are based on various assumptions. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.

However, these revenues do not give effect to (i) the expected full run-rate effect of contract wins made prior to June 30, 2021, including the contract with Tesco Bank that was concluded in the third quarter of 2021, and (ii) the increase in revenues from management fees generated by our ACO 1 fund for investments which have already been committed, but for which fees have not been accrued fully during this period. We expect that our revenues from the Asset Management and Servicing business would increase to approximately £75 million based on (a) budgeted revenue from 26 new contract wins in 2020 and budgeted revenue from a further 11 new contract wins during the first half of 2021, as well as the contract with Tesco Bank that was concluded in the third quarter of 2021, less revenues derived from contracts due to expire during that period, and (b) run-rate for asset management and servicing fees based on the deployment of the Fund during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and being serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing business. We have derived an estimated run-rate effect of these budgeted revenues by assuming a 45% EBITDA Margin to the expected revenue increase of approximately £11 million. We believe that the assumption of 45% EBITDA Margin is reasonable based on our experience with similar contracts. (3) Run-rate effect of revenues from our Fund and Investment Management business represent the incremental management fees of approximately £2 million generated from the deployment by the Fund during the six-month period ended June 30, 2021. The run-rate effect has been calculated by multiplying the net asset value, excluding any working capital borrowings within the Fund, by the average management fees generated, and subtracting that from the actual management fees for the six months ended June 30, 2021. (4) We have provided an Annualized Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA figure which is derived by multiplying our Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021 by two. (5) Management is targeting £20 million of cost savings comprising three elements, being (i) target annual estimated cost savings of £6 million on account of conversion of AGG from a public listed company to a private company (the savings are expected to be delivered as a result of the Acquisition and will include reduced board management costs, reduction due to the removal of the existing long term incentive plan and share incentive plan schemes, lower advisor costs, reduced investor relations activity and sundry savings), (ii) £6 million of estimated savings expected to be realized at or shortly after the completion of the strategic review and are expected to be delivered through organizational changes and reduced central functions overhead costs, such as cost savings expected from the planned vertical alignment of our local platforms and the corresponding local investment strategies under a fund management framework and our focus on creating a cost-ownership culture which engenders accountability and delivers efficiencies without creating dual-layer costs (see “Business—Cost Structure Development and _Cost Saving Opportunities—Cost Savings” for further information), and (iii) £8 million of estimated targeted savings, which will be targeted_ to be delivered following the completion of the strategic review during the course of 2022. The savings are expected to be realized through greater efficiency, increased accountability and operational leverage within the platforms, such as the implementation of collection cost reduction initiatives. The total targeted cost savings of £20 million of net run-rate annual cost savings represent 8.9% of our overall cost base based on a cost base of £225 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Furthermore, an independent third-party advisor estimates total cost savings of between £17 and £32 million, with £9 to £20 million overhead cost reductions and £8 to £13 million in direct cost reductions. This compares with the management’s target savings of £20 million as outlined above. The independent third-party advisor also estimates one-off costs ranging from £10 million to £20 million in order to realize such cost savings.

For example: - In Portugal, we are subject to oversight by the CMVM, with Hefesto being an authorized and supervised entity. While our purchases of non-paying loan portfolios from Portuguese credit institutions are generally not considered to constitute a regulated activity, they, together with our engagement of local agencies, fall under the general rules of the Portuguese Civil Code. In addition, we must comply with the GDPR, and Law no. 41/2004 of August 18, which implements in Portugal the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC). - In the Netherlands, in order to act as an intermediary in respect of consumer credit and/or mortgage credit and to offer consumer credit and/or mortgage credit (including activities relating to the servicing of existing credit agreements granted by third parties), we must have and maintain licenses granted by the AFM and the Vesting Group entities that have such licenses must comply with ongoing requirements and rules of conduct. In addition, to the extent we collect and process personal data as data controllers, we must comply with statutory obligations under the GDPR. - In Italy, we operate through Zenith, which is a financial intermediary regulated and supervised by the Bank of Italy, and Parr, now trading as Whitestar Italy. We also need to comply with the Italian data protection legislation and the relevant Italian anti-money laundering regulation, which both incorporate EU-wide legislative requirements. - In Ireland, through Mars Capital Ireland (acquired as part of the Mars acquisition), we operate as a credit servicing firm and are regulated by the CBI. As a regulated credit servicing firm, we are authorized to manage and administer credit agreements advanced to borrowers, including mortgages secured on properties in Ireland and abroad. We are required to comply with all applicable CBI codes of conduct and applicable data protection regulations, including the GDPR and the Irish Data Protections Acts. A failure by us, or our agents or assignees, to comply with the applicable legal, regulatory and licensing requirements may, for example, result in the suspension, termination or impairment of our ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction or other sanctions, including fines and public censure. As we expand potentially into new jurisdictions, our business will be subject to applicable laws, regulations, rules and licensing requirements in those jurisdictions, which may be different, or more onerous, than in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate. Further, due to Brexit, we may be subject to differing sets of rules and regulations in the UK and EU.

The FCA regards debt collection as a “higher-risk” activity, which is subject to detailed conduct of business rules and, generally, more stringent regulatory standards than “lowerrisk” activities. In addition, the FCA has substantial enforcement powers and a broad range of disciplinary measures that it can apply. To date, the FCA has already taken action against a number of operators in the consumer credit and mortgage servicing industries including various debt management firms. The FCA may take further action against our industry as a whole that may require significant modifications to how we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and financial condition. Our business in the UK is conducted through the UK Regulated Firms, which are Group companies that are authorized and regulated by the FCA to conduct consumer credit and mortgagerelated regulated activities.

The FCA is required by FSMA to determine whether a firm that is authorized by the FCA continues to meet the threshold conditions. Failure to continually meet the threshold conditions may result ----- in the FCA taking disciplinary action, including commencing a process to vary, suspend or withdraw a firm’s authorization. Where an authorized firm breaches FCA rules, the FCA may take enforcement action which might lead it to, for example, impose a financial penalty on that firm or issue a public statement of censure. Since our receipt of FCA authorization in August 2016, we have had an open and transparent relationship with the FCA, including the fact that we have made a number of notifications to the FCA in compliance with its Principles of Business Rules. Following such notifications, the FCA has sought information on a number of our activities, including, but not limited to, refunds for customers where their accounts have a credit balance due to over-payments or account adjustments, the remediation of customer accounts to meet requirements of the CCA, the application of post-judgment interest to customer accounts by DCAs and collection of statute barred debt. If any of the UK Regulated Firms’ authorization is varied, suspended or withdrawn, our business would be severely constrained and could not continue to be operated in the way it is currently being operated. In addition, any variation, suspension or withdrawal of authorization, or certain other disciplinary action taken by the FCA against one of the UK Regulated Firms, may become publicly known and may result in severe reputational damage. If any of the UK Regulated Firms becomes subject to disciplinary action by the FCA, Investment Portfolio Sellers that currently do business with us may cease to do so, and our ability to purchase debt and our ability to win future business may be materially adversely affected. Further, disciplinary action may require us to make potentially significant changes to our business practices or expend significant sums in fines, redress or remediation. We might also have to introduce changes to our business practices in response to disciplinary action taken against competitors or as a result of the FCA’s supervisory activities (such as thematic reviews of the consumer credit and mortgage servicing markets). Remedial actions that may be necessary could increase our costs, reduce our ability to collect from our purchased portfolios, reduce our ability to invest and develop our Fund and Investment Management business and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our risk management and compliance framework may require additional investment and resources to satisfy applicable FCA requirements and we may need to enhance it further to comply with forthcoming and future legal and regulatory requirements. In addition to certain FCA requirements, the UK Regulated Firms are also subject to numerous detailed legislative and regulatory requirements, principally contained in FSMA, the CCA, the UTCCR, the CRA and the CPUTR. The UK Regulated Firms are also subject to the FCA Handbook which sets out rules and guidance, including PRIN, GEN, SYSC, CONC and MCOB (as relevant). See “Regulation and Compliance—Regulatory Framework—United _Kingdom.” We subscribe to the Standards of Lending Practice issued by the LSB, having become_ a registered firm with the LSB in July 2016. Regardless of each company’s direct legal and regulatory position, the UK Regulated Firms may be subject to contractual obligations to observe certain requirements under, or to ensure that their business is run in a way that is not inconsistent with, certain additional FCA rules or requirements. As a result of our registration with the LSB, we are required to comply with the ----- relevant provisions of the Standards of Lending Practice by Investment Portfolio Sellers and, therefore, we operate in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Standards of Lending Practice. Any failure by us or our agents or assignees to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance (such as the rules and guidance on irresponsible lending and debt collection, fund and investment management), or material contractual obligations could result in regulatory investigations or enforcement action (that may, for example, lead to fines, obligations to implement remediation programs, the variation, suspension or withdrawal of authorization for some or all of the UK Regulated Firms), court sanctions (that may, for example, render customer agreements, or certain contractual terms therein, unenforceable or require us to repay sums or pay damages to borrowers or investors), FOS examinations (that may, for example, require us to pay compensation) and reputational damage. Further, and as an example, non-compliance with certain provisions of the CCA may render customer agreements unenforceable against the borrower and result in there being no obligation on the borrower to pay interest and charges during the period of non-compliance, and may also require interest and charges that have already been collected to be refunded. As the UK Regulated Firms are dependent on information being provided to them by Investment Portfolio Sellers to enable them to comply with certain obligations under the CCA, a failure to obtain this information at the time of purchase or to ensure that there are suitable contractual obligations on the Investment Portfolio Seller to provide this information could adversely affect the UK Regulated Firms’ ability to comply with those obligations. In addition, such failure to comply, variation, suspension or withdrawal of authorization, or any actions by us that may damage the reputation or increase the compliance risk of any Investment Portfolio Seller, could entitle an Investment Portfolio Seller to terminate any Forward Flow Agreement with us and to seek available remedies. In such a case, the Investment Portfolio Seller may be entitled to repurchase portfolios that we previously purchased from it. Damage to our reputation, whether due to a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance or material contractual obligations, variation, suspension or withdrawal of authorization, or any other regulatory action, could deter Investment Portfolio Sellers and investors from selling portfolios to us or investing with us and/or result in our being removed from their sales panels. Moreover, failure by the UK Regulated Firms or by Investment Portfolio Sellers to comply with consumer protection legislation may lead to customer agreements becoming unenforceable (in part or in whole), which could render the UK Regulated Firms unable to collect purchased debts and, depending on the breach, may result in them losing the right to charge (or retain) interest and other fees or charges under such agreements without taking appropriate remedial action (which could be costly and time consuming) or at all.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

We may, for example, incur costs in reimbursing customers by reason of violations by DCAs and other third parties that adversely affected such customers.

Waystone Management Company (IE) Luxembourg Branch (formerly DMS) has been appointed to act as the partnership’s Alternative Investment Fund Manager (the “AIFM”). The AIFM is ultimately responsible for, inter alia, the risk management, valuation and portfolio management of the Fund, but the AIFM has delegated portfolio management in respect of the Fund to the Fund Manager. The AIFM is authorized and regulated as an alternative investment fund manager by the Central Bank of Ireland under the European Communities (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive) regulations 2013. The Fund Manager is licensed by the JFSC to conduct fund services business pursuant to the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 (as amended, the “Jersey FS Law”) and is required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Code of Practice for FSB. In order to support the Fund Manager’s compliance with the Jersey FS Law and the fund services business codes of practice promulgated thereunder, the Fund Manager is itself managed and administered by Saltgate Limited, a Jersey regulated administrator, which is licensed to act as a Manager of a Managed Entity (such administrator, the “MoME”).

Where a right of action has accrued to recover a debt and the person liable or accountable for the claim acknowledges the claim or makes any payment in respect of it, the right of claim is treated as having accrued on the date of acknowledgement or payment, and runs for six years from that date. In 2001, the Law Commission published a report on certain proposed reforms to the Limitations Act 1980 to, among other things, shorten the current statute of limitations period for certain types of claims in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from six years to three years. In the event that the statutory limitation periods were to be reduced in the future, the value of purchased debt on our financial statements could be reduced because the portion of amounts recovered and recoverable would likely decrease, leading to significant impairment charges as a result of loan portfolios carrying value reductions. A reduction in the statutory limitation period may also reduce the market size for debt purchase opportunities, and increase marginal costs in the debt collection industry, as court proceedings might be initiated earlier in the credit cycle. Although there has been no change to the limitation period for the collection of debts as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there can be no assurance that the statute of limitations period for enforcement of payment obligations will not be shortened in the future in the various jurisdictions in which we now operate or may in the future operate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

This would increase our fixed cost base, thereby causing Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs (i.e., the direct costs of external collections related to our purchased loan portfolios such as commissions paid to third-party outsourced providers, in-house collection costs, credit bureau data costs and legal costs associated with collections) to rise without necessarily increasing Balance Sheet Cash Collections. Although we are not currently aware of any such proposal in relation to DCAs or other participants in the debt purchase and collection industries, similar restrictions were introduced for independent financial advisers and other firms as part of the FSA’s retail distribution review. These firms can no longer earn provider-determined commissions for successful recommendations of retail investment products but must instead be paid an adviser charge, which is agreed with retail clients in advance.

Although primarily focused on particular sectors of the market, such as high cost credit or where customers are non-prime or vulnerable, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the consumer credit and consumer mortgage servicing markets regarding forbearance more broadly. To the extent that new, or amended, laws or regulations in any jurisdiction in which we operate reduce the return on investments that accrue to investors and/or the profitability of issuing credit and result in lower credit issuance volumes, there could be reduced demand for fund and investment management, asset management and servicing and a reduced supply of portfolios for sale, which could, among other things, lead us to either decrease our fees and lower profitability for us or increase our prices and lower returns on investments.

The outbreak has resulted in governments and businesses throughout the world implementing numerous measures intended to contain and limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, self-isolation, heightened border controls and lockdown orders, business restrictions, shutdowns and other limitations. We sought to protect our employees and moved rapidly to working from home for our employees. The COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns or limitations in the operations of certain nonessential businesses have created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented restrictions on individuals and businesses all around the world, and materially impacted the global economy. Despite significant governmental intervention, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the UK, European and global economies, with considerable uncertainty of the effects that this will have on employment, real estate values and other health and economic factors. In line with the impacts on many other businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our cash collections during March 2020 and reduced cash collections to their lowest point in April 2020 as the macroeconomic environment deteriorated. Moreover, lockdown measures were introduced in the countries in which we operate, resulting in court closures and impacting our ability to litigate and operate as normal. Although an economic recovery is partially underway, it continues to be uneven and characterized by meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions, with uncertainty regarding its ultimate length and trajectory. As such, we remain cautious in our approach to both investment in new portfolio investments and the valuation of our ERC. ----- The longer the COVID-19 pandemic impacts activity levels in the locations and sectors in which we operate, the more likely it is to have a sustained, material adverse impact on us. In particular, issues with respect to the distribution or adoption of vaccines or the spread of variants of the virus could result in new restrictions being imposed by governments and businesses and lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. These and other factors may delay a return to ordinary course economic activity before the COVID-19 pandemic, or cause the UK and European economies or other major global economies to experience a recession. As such, the scale and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the potential adverse effects on our business, financial performance and operating results, which may be material and affect us in ways that we cannot foresee at this time. Many of the adverse ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact us have already materialized (and may in the future materialize or adversely affect us), including the negative impact on our ERC valuation, the operations of our businesses, our creditors, our counterparties, as well as our customers. The risks from the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar pandemics, may, in the future, become even more significant than is currently the case or than is currently anticipated. If and when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the market turmoil and other changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may have lasting effects on our business and operations. The proliferation of remote working may result in long-term changes to market, consumer and workplace practices that could negatively impact us. In addition, consumer practices and demands may permanently, or for an extended period of time, change from what they were prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we fail to adapt investment strategies to these and other changes, this could adversely impact the returns on the Fund’s investments and, consequently, our business. Although it is impossible to predict with certainty the potential full magnitude of the business and economic effects, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may further impact, our business in various ways, including but not limited to: - Difficult market and economic conditions may adversely impact our customers and/or real estate prices, which, with other impacts, may affect the collections on our and the Fund’s portfolios, our ERC valuation, our Asset Management and Servicing third-party clients and revenues, the level investments made by our Fund and Investment Management business and the overall performance of our business. - The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increases the challenges associated with business planning, strategy, execution, portfolio management, fundraising and other aspects of our business operations. Neither we, the Fund nor our counterparties, suppliers or advisors have previously faced a situation that is comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic which, among other factors, involves a major simultaneous supply and demand shock to global, regional and national economies and significant outsize effects on particular business sectors. The future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic is subject to a complex interplay of epidemiological, technological, social, psychological, economic and political factors that are generally beyond our ability to forecast or control. In this environment, historical comparisons may be of little or no value, while the risk and uncertainty associated with a large number of business decisions are materially increased. ----- - Limitations on travel and social distancing requirements implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic challenge our ability to market new funds as anticipated prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially resulting in reduced or delayed revenue. In addition, LP investors may become restricted by their asset allocation policies from investing in new funds that we provide, because these policies often restrict the amount that they are permitted to invest in alternative assets like the strategies employed by the Fund when there is a decline in public equity markets. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause LP investors to change their investment strategies in manners that we cannot foresee, and that may additionally and negatively affect our ability to raise future funds. - While the market dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would be expected to present attractive investment opportunities, due to increased volatility in the financial markets, we may not be able to compete for those investments. - The regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic (in the form of government approved legislative moratoria to provide repayment relief to individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, among others), remains uncertain with the real potential for changes in the efficacy of litigation strategies to collect customers’ debts. This has the potential to change current ERC valuations, as well as to cause the pricing of unsecured consumer debt to be more difficult and less attractive in the future. - If the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we and the Fund may have more limited opportunities to successfully exit existing investments, due to, among other reasons, lower valuations, decreased revenue and earnings, lack of potential buyers with financial resources to pursue an acquisition, or limited or no ability to conduct initial public offerings in equity capital markets, resulting in a reduced ability to realize value from such investments. - Our DCAs, other servicers and outsource partners have also faced disruption and may face in the future increased credit and liquidity risk due to volatility in financial markets, reduced revenue streams and limited or higher costs of access to funding, which may result in disruption to our business, including but not limited to potential impairment of our investments. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors that are unpredictable, including, among others: the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic; governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global economic activity, unemployment levels and financial markets, including the possibility of a global recession and volatility in the global capital markets which, among other factors, may increase the our cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital. In addition, we cannot predict the long-term impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business and the Fund’s investments. ----- Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, net income and cash flows.

We are, therefore, exposed to economic, market, fiscal, regulatory, legislative, political and social conditions in the each of the foregoing jurisdictions. Each of the foregoing jurisdictions has experienced recession in the last 10 years. Improvement in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate could affect our business and performance in various ways, including an increase in collections due to rises in real estate prices, and an increase in the amount of one-off payments and early repayments made by customers. It could also lead to a reduction in the number of attractive portfolio opportunities which are available for us to invest in, and more competitive pricing, as financing becomes more widely available for competitors at a lower cost of funding. Conversely, sustained effects of prolonged economic weakness, and poor prospects for economic growth, in the markets in which we operate could have various impacts on our business and performance, primarily and as a direct result of the effects of weak economic conditions on our customers. If the global economy suffers a prolonged, material downturn (including as a result of COVID-19) that affects the markets we operate in through, among other things, an increase in the unemployment rate, volatility or decline in real estate prices, increased inflation, the implementation of enhanced austerity measures (such as reduction in the relevant government’s provisions of public benefits and/or public sector employment), reduced disposable income, impacting interest rates, and the availability of credit, consumers may be unable or unwilling to continue repaying debt, and we may not be able to collect debt successfully in a manner consistent with our past practice. If our consumers experience a reduced ability or willingness to pay their debt, we could face increased servicing costs and lower average payments, thereby reducing our cash generation and returns on capital, and, in turn, our ERC. The volatility and uncertainty that affected the banking system and financial markets during the global financial crisis and the period that followed resulted in a contraction of credit markets. In particular, there was a significant shift in the collections environment as a result of the collapse of the sub-prime lending market in 2008, which resulted in the tightening of capital requirements and lending standards, such as those introduced in the UK in April 2014 as a result of the Mortgage Market Review, a UK based investigation of the mortgage market that was conducted following the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, governments in many countries responded to adverse economic conditions by introducing various austerity measures, such as cuts in public benefits and public sector employment. In the UK, this included wide-ranging reform of ----- the benefits system, including the introduction of a universal credit and a cap on the total amount of benefits that most people of working age can receive. The effects of factors such as tightened lending standards, the COVID-19 pandemic, and welfare reforms may reduce the propensity of financial institutions to lend to customers, leading to a reduced supply of debt available for purchase, as well as negatively affecting our customers by reducing disposable income levels or otherwise impairing their ability to service payment obligations. The effect may be more pronounced for us given the proportion of the portfolios purchased in the financial services sector. More recently, we have seen increased inflation, or the potential for increased inflation, that could lead to increased collections given the potential for increased real-estate prices. Increased inflation, however, could also squeeze customers’ disposable incomes and/or lead to increased interest rates, both of which would likely be detrimental to our collections performance. In addition, greater restrictions on international trade could, if implemented, eventually increase costs, decrease margins and reduce the competitiveness of products and services offered by European companies, which could, in turn, adversely affect the economies of the markets in which we operate. Furthermore, since we invest in portfolios containing real estate assets, any impact from climate change, such as localized flooding, could result in a reduction in the value of the underlying real estate asset, in turn leading to a lower expected collection. As a result of the foregoing, our future growth, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected either as a direct result of reduced collections or because of valuation impairments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

On December 24, 2020, the UK and the European Union announced that they had agreed to a new trade and cooperation deal (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”) governing certain aspects of the future relationship between the UK and the European Union. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement applies from January 1, 2021 and provides clarity in respect of the intended shape of the future relationship between the UK and the European Union and some detailed matters of trade and cooperation but does not address substantive future cooperation with respect to financial services or reciprocal market access under so-called “equivalence” arrangements. In addition, UK service suppliers no longer benefit from automatic access to the entire European Union single market and free movement of goods is subject to increased bureaucracy. Although the Trade and Cooperation Agreement contains provisions on short-term business visits without visas or work permits, this does not amount to the free provision of services nor the free movement between the European Union and the UK. The loss of these benefits, ----- together with the ongoing uncertainty with respect to financial services under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, could impact the attractiveness of the UK as a global business and financial center. Although the long-term impact of such changes, and of Brexit more broadly, is uncertain, Brexit may have an adverse effect on the rate of economic growth in the UK and the European Union, which may negatively impact asset values in those regions. Additionally, given the size and global significance of the UK’s economy, ongoing uncertainty related to Brexit and the relationship between the UK and the European Union could cause instability in the European Union, UK or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions. Uncertainty in respect of such conditions could result in the relocation of businesses and people, cause business interruptions, cause currency fluctuations (including in relation to pounds sterling and the Euro), lead to trade restrictions and increases in or the imposition of trade tariffs, lead to economic recession or depression, affect the availability of credit and impact the stability of the financial markets, political systems, financial institutions and the financial and monetary system. By extension, this may adversely affect our ability to source attractive investments in the European Union and may impact the value of our investments that are located in the European Union, or those that conduct business in or derive revenue from the European Union. The uncertainty surrounding the UK’s future relationship with the European Union could also adversely affect our funds, including the Fund, the performance of their investments and their ability to source investment opportunities. In addition, Brexit will likely increase our cost of raising capital, and conducting business generally, including the potential to suffer withholding tax and the cost of complying with two, potentially divergent, regimes. Changes in regulation may also impair our ability to recruit, retain and motivate new employees and retain key employees. Moreover, any Brexit-related effects are also likely to be compounded by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the evolution of any agreements (or lack thereof) that the UK makes to retain access to European Union markets. Brexit is likely to impact the legal rights and obligations of commercial parties across all industries, including the financial services industry. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate, which could present new regulatory costs and challenges and could potentially disrupt the markets we serve, our ability to market our products and services to investors or conduct other regulated activity in the European Union. Accordingly, any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Any of these occurrences could affect our ability to collect our receivables, provide services to our clients and/or generate returns for us and LP investors in our ----- Fund and Investment Management business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

If interest rates rise, this could impair the financial viability of customers who have variable interest rate obligations (such as home mortgages) or other significant debt that bears floating rate interest, as well as leading to reductions in real estate prices. This could, directly or indirectly, lead to a reduction in customers’ disposable income and, as a result, their ability to repay their debts to us. If our customers experience a reduced ability to pay their debts, DCAs and servicers may require higher commissions to address increased Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs, and we could face higher payment plan default rates and lower average payments, which together with lower real estate prices could reduce our cash generation, return on capital and ERC. Even if we are able to develop payment plans in relation to certain of these obligations, such measures may prove unsuccessful. Further, we could more quickly reach a point of saturation with certain customers (i.e., the number of accounts matched to a customer may reach a point at which that customer lacks the financial means to pay on all of the accounts that we own). Even if our efforts were to prove successful in avoiding some defaults, total collections may still decline and/or the timing of receipt of payments may lengthen, any of which would impair our financial condition and materially adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, rising interest rates may increase our financing costs, which may result in our inability to finance portfolio purchases at profitable levels or at all.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

For example, in an improving economic environment there may be a lag in any increase in the supply of portfolios available for purchase as debt originators adjust the level of new debt originated to maintain target default levels. Conversely, in a deteriorating economic environment, a high proportion of defaulted consumer debt may be serviced in-house or by DCAs, leaving fewer purchasing opportunities for debt purchasers, such as us, as debt originators’ propensity to sell defaulted consumer debt at prices prevailing in the market declines. See “—Changes in the economic and/or political _environment and/or the climate in the markets in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”_ The impact of macro factors on our business was demonstrated by events in 2009, during which the UK market for defaulted consumer debt sales decreased significantly. This decline was primarily due to restrictions on the availability of funding for debt purchases and the general contraction of credit during the ensuing recession, lower collections of payments from portfolios and lower volumes of portfolios being offered by Investment Portfolio Sellers as a result of decreased demand and lower spot prices. In addition, debt originators altered their debt management practices, in response to lower prices, by warehousing their “fresh” and semiperforming portfolios in anticipation of better prices and directing the collection of such portfolios to DCAs, while offering older, often secondary and tertiary debt, to the debt purchase market. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our cash collections during March 2020 which reduced to their lowest point in April 2020 as the macroeconomic environment deteriorated, and lockdown measures were introduced in the countries in which we operate, resulting in court closures and impacting our ability to litigate and operate as normal. In addition, Investment Portfolio Sellers may develop technological tools that they believe are more effective in terms of tracing technology and customer profile development. If Investment Portfolio Sellers choose to perform more of their debt collections internally as a result of these data quality improvements or otherwise, the volume of portfolio sales or the quality of underlying debt sold could decrease and, consequently, we may not be able to buy the type and quantity of ----- portfolios at prices consistent with our historical return targets. In addition, there could be a reduction in the availability of portfolios sold early in the collections cycle that have been subject to little or no collections activity. This fresher debt typically has higher collection expectations because less work has been applied to the assets to obtain customer payments. Further, regulation may diminish the supply of defaulted debt for sale in the event that debt originators are unable to extend credit to the same extent as they have been able to do historically. If we are unable to purchase portfolios from Investment Portfolio Sellers at appropriate prices, or if one or more Investment Portfolio Sellers stop or decrease their sales of portfolios due to any of the factors listed above or for any other reason, or if we do not replace the Existing Portfolios that we collect from with additional portfolios, we could lose a significant potential source of income and our prospects, business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Historically, we have funded such purchases through borrowings and cash generated by our operations and capital injections by our shareholders. Our ability to obtain funding from the debt capital markets, our shareholders or the loan market in the future will depend on our performance and our prospects, as well as factors over which we do not exercise control. Such factors may include weak economic and capital market conditions during or prior to periods in which attractive portfolios are available for purchase, the ability and willingness of banks to lend to our industry generally or to us in particular, and changes in fiscal, monetary and other government policies, among others. If we do not have sufficient headroom in the Revolving Facility (or if it is fully drawn), we may be unable to draw down the Revolving Facility or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or on a timely basis to portfolio purchases, which in turn may limit our ability to take advantage of opportunities for portfolio purchases arising in the market and/or develop our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses.

As such, we seek to acquire a substantial portion of our portfolios off-market. Any change in the appetite of Investment Portfolio Sellers to sell portfolios off-market, an increase in competition for off-market purchases and/or our inability to source appropriate levels of off-market trades could reduce the returns that we, and the Fund Manager on behalf of LP investors, can generate. We may also face competition from financial investors. The existence of a national identification system in new markets (such as ----- continental European countries) could negatively affect the competitive advantage of our datadriven business model, thereby negatively affecting our ability to compete for portfolio purchases in such markets. Our inability or unwillingness to compete on the basis of price (or, if competitors are able to operate more efficiently or at greater scale), could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

It is our intention that for future funds, our level of co-investment may decrease from the current 25% to approximately 10% as we reduce our investment in the more capital intensive Balance Sheet business and grow our capital-light revenues through the development of our Fund and Investment Management and our Asset Management and Servicing businesses. In the event that the Fund Manager is unable to acquire the expected level of portfolios, then the investment by Arrow SMA will be below our expectations, resulting in lower revenue and collections than anticipated. Furthermore, there is a risk that the type and characteristics of portfolios acquired by the Fund Manager have different characteristics from portfolios acquired before the development of our Fund and Investment Management business. The attractiveness of a portfolio for LP investors, and hence the Fund or future funds (which could potentially be structured differently than the Fund), may be different from Arrow SMA. For example, the Fund and future funds may have a different appetite for minimum target returns and/or a smooth collections profile.

We face competition from new and existing purchasers of portfolios as well as fund and asset managers. We purchase a broad range of portfolios and often these portfolios are acquired through an off-market sales process. Our origination capabilities to source such portfolio acquisitions is an important competitive advantage. In the future, our current competitors and any new competitors may have or may in the future develop substantially greater origination, underwriting, financial, technical, personnel or other resources such as more effective pricing and collection models, more efficient operating structures, greater adaptability to changing market needs and more established relationships in the debt purchase industry than us. Our Asset Management and Servicing business supports our investment in portfolio acquisitions made by our Balance Sheet business and by our Fund and Investment Management business. However, certain competitors have more significant debt collection businesses, in addition to operations involving the purchase of portfolios. These competitors may be able to service portfolios more efficiently and/or offer originators a “bundle” of services, or they may be ----- able to better use the consumer data to help them price portfolios more accurately. Competitors have acquired, and may in the future acquire, DCAs that we place accounts with. This, and potential consolidation of DCAs, may result in accounts being recalled. In the future, we may not have the resources or the ability to compete successfully in certain segments of the market. We may not be able to maintain the synergies, or the advantages in tracing technology, customer profile development or low Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs or asset management that we believe we currently possess. Moreover, the industry may shift away from a debt purchase model of collecting distressed debt. If we are unable to develop and expand our business or adapt to changing market needs as effectively as our current or future competitors do, or if our competitors are able to operate at a lower cost of capital or make improvements in their pricing or collections methods that we are not able to make, we, alongside the Fund and future funds, may be unable to access, and be successful in, competitive sale processes for portfolios and/or viable investment assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Such debt may subsequently be deemed uncollectable and written off. Our purchased portfolios include both Paying Accounts, which consist of accounts that have shown at least one payment over the preceding three months or at least two payments over the preceding six months, and non-Paying Accounts, which may be higher risk and have less predictable cash flows than Paying Accounts, as well as real estate and/or other assets, such as cash in court or tax credits. Although we estimate that the recoveries on our purchased portfolios will be in excess of the amount we paid for them, amounts recovered may be less than expected and may even be less than the total amount paid for such portfolios. Any condition or development that causes these portfolios to lose value, such as a decrease in expected collections or a reduction in secured asset values leading to lower collections, will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As collecting on our Existing Portfolios may take a long time, and the factors affecting debt collection rates may be volatile and outside our control, we may not be able to identify economic trends or make changes in our purchasing strategies in a timely manner. We may not be able to achieve the levels of collections forecast prior to purchase of any debt, or collect anything at all. In addition, the assumptions used in our models may be incorrect or some of the accounts in a portfolio may behave differently from the way we expect. For example, accounts in foreign jurisdictions may have direct debt instructions that are more challenging to engage, resulting in lower collections on such accounts. Court processing delays and the length of the judicial process generally in jurisdictions such as Portugal and Italy could lead to collections failing to meet expectations. Any of these factors could result in a loss of value in a portfolio after purchase and a continuing deterioration in value over time as actual collections can deviate significantly from the collection estimates produced by our pricing model. ----- If the cash flows from our Existing Portfolios (and the portfolios we purchase in the future) are less than anticipated, we may have difficulty servicing our indebtedness and may be unable to purchase new portfolios that we would like to purchase.

For example, we use a portfolio valuation model to project remaining cash flow generation from purchased portfolios, our ERC and our Net Deal IRR. However, at the time of purchase, we are likely to have imperfect information about the precise age of the receivables, the ability of the customer to pay, the valuation of real estate assets, the time at which the customer will pay or the real estate will be disposed of and the cost required to service and collect on such debts/assets and it may take several years for us to recoup the original purchase price of our investment in portfolios. Moreover, information based on historical market behavior and statisticbased historical models may not accurately predict, or be indicative of, the characteristics of subsequent portfolios purchased from the same Investment Portfolio Seller or the same industry due to changes in business practices or economic developments. In addition, if we purchase types of portfolios with which we have limited experience, or purchase portfolios in geographies in which we have no prior experience, or from Investment Portfolio Sellers with whom we have had no prior dealings, our ability to properly price and to collect on such portfolios may be adversely affected. Our statistical models and analytical tools assess information provided by third parties, such as credit bureaus and other mainstream or public sources, or generated by software products. These models, together with our local expertise, external or desktop valuations for secured assets and our assessment of recoverability for certain assets, are used within the business to formulate the ERC, which is a key input to the valuation of portfolio investments held on the balance sheet. These models also use an assessment of the economic conditions and future actual collections performance may be different from the modelled ERC.

The failure to achieve the targeted returns could be as a result of many factors, including but not limited to, the collections performance of the portfolios, costs incurred with servicing such portfolios, macro-economic challenges, the competitive environment and operational challenges; - The Fund Manager may be restricted from pursuing certain investment opportunities due to restrictions within the mandate it has from LP investors or concentration limits stipulated by the relevant fund agreement. A failure to be able to take advantage of such opportunities may restrict the returns that the Fund Manager can generate and, thereby reduce the overall fees that we can generate; and - The appetite of LP investors, general availability of funds in the market, our investment track record and competitor fundraising activity may impact the ability of the Fund Manager to raise additional funds in due course.

A significant decrease in the volume of debt or other non-core assets available for purchase on acceptable terms from any of our principal Investment Portfolio Sellers would force us to seek alternative sources of debt/assets to purchase. In addition to the factors that impact the supply of portfolios generally, Investment Portfolio Sellers with whom we have strategic relationships may not continue to sell portfolios to us on desirable terms or in acceptable quantities, and we may not be able to replace such purchases with purchases from other Investment Portfolio Sellers. An Investment Portfolio Seller’s decision to sell debt/assets to us is based on various factors, including the price and terms offered and our reputation, scale, track record of completed transactions and compliance history. The loss of a key relationship with an Investment Portfolio Seller could jeopardize our existing relationships with other Investment Portfolio Sellers or our ability to establish new relationships with other Investment Portfolio Sellers. We may be unable to find alternative sources from which to purchase portfolios and, even if such purchases could be successfully replaced, the search could take time or the debt/assets could be of lower quality or higher cost, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Whilst much of the servicing is undertaken by our servicing platforms, we rely on our relationships with DCAs and other external servicers to conduct our business. We may lose a key DCA/servicer relationship for a number of reasons, including as a result of an acquisition by one of our competitors or the financial failure of a DCA/servicer. This could further increase our dependence on our remaining key relationships. ----- We also rely on key third-party IT service providers to supply the majority of our core IT applications, systems, infrastructure, back-up, storage, data recovery and disaster recovery systems and the loss of IT support could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

The development of our Fund and Investment Management business has increased the reliance that we place on a number of counterparties, such as the MoME and the Depositary. We rely on these third parties to effectively manage collection operations, undertake aspects of our Fund and Investment Management business, preserve a variable cost structure and to meet our servicing needs efficiently, but these third parties may not have the resources, employee training or management experience that we require. This may negatively impact their ability to comply with applicable laws, other regulatory requirements and our requirements. Further, these third parties could commit fraud with respect to the customer accounts and portfolios that we or the Fund Manager place with them or fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations such as data protection requirements or to provide us with accurate data on the accounts they are servicing. Also, if any third-party carrying on regulated activities (including the DCAs and other servicers with which we do business) were unable to obtain regulatory authorization at the relevant time, we may have to recall accounts from that third-party, which could interrupt customer payments and result in financial loss for us. To the extent these third parties violate laws, other regulatory requirements or their contractual obligations to us, or act inappropriately in the conduct of their business, our business and reputation could be negatively affected or penalties could be directly imposed on us, as, in the UK in particular, the FCA expects regulated businesses, such as the UK Regulated Firms, to comply with its rules and guidance on outsourcing, which means that regulated businesses need to carefully select any third parties with whom they work and, to a certain degree, take responsibility for any third-party compliance violations. Furthermore, the ICO could hold us directly liable for any failure by our DCAs or other servicers to comply with UK data protection requirements. We may also suffer losses pursuant to ----- our agreements with Investment Portfolio Sellers who have required, and may require, us to ensure compliance by sub-contractors with applicable laws or other regulatory requirements. Furthermore, we may not be aware of the occurrence of any such violations. In addition, a financially weak DCA or other servicer may be unable to continue to fund collection activity, including taking steps to actively manage accounts assigned to it, without our support. Such support, and any strategies that we may implement in respect of underperforming DCAs or other servicers, may not result in anticipated benefits. If one or more of our DCAs or other servicers, such as IT suppliers or credit data providers, were to experience financial difficulties or enter into administration or become insolvent, this could cause disruptions and delays to our cash flows or prevent us from recovering the full amount paid to the DCA or other servicer. Although we may select DCAs and other servicers based on prior relative performance, there is no guarantee of future performance, and any underperformance on the part of DCAs, other servicers and other counterparties, whether as a result of failing to meet the financial targets required by us or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Future growth and the development of our Fund and Investment Management business, among other things, could place a strain on our resources, including but not limited to resources in our portfolio pricing, origination, change management, information technology, tax, legal, finance and accounting and other departments, as well as require the expansion of our procedures for monitoring internal accounting functions, risk management and continued compliance with regulatory requirements and our reporting obligations. Our expansion within markets or to new markets will require additional investment of both financial and management resources to ensure that the business performs as a single enterprise and that the oversight and monitoring processes are applied consistently in all locations. Any resulting growth of our employee base may also increase our need for internal audit, training and monitoring processes that are more extensive and broader in scope than those that we have historically required.

For further details of the key acquisitions we have made, see ----- “Business—Our History and Development.” Successful growth through future acquisitions is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions and integrate the acquired business into the Group. If we make acquisitions, we may not be able to generate expected margins or cash flows, or to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including growth or expected synergies. Our assessments of, and assumptions regarding, acquisition targets may prove to be incorrect, and actual developments may differ significantly from expectations. We may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our business or such integration may require more investment than expected, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies with respect to, among others, customers, employees, suppliers, government authorities or to other third parties, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions of businesses that operate in jurisdictions other than the jurisdictions in which we operate would subject us to market practices, as well as regulatory requirements, that differ from those we currently are familiar with, which may subject us to unanticipated risks. We may also have ongoing obligations to Investment Portfolio Sellers under the sale and purchase documentation. In addition, prior to the completion of such acquisitions, the entities in the target group will not be subject to the covenants included in the Indenture. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date, the seller or any of its subsidiaries will not take an action that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable. Once an acquisition has occurred, the process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our operations and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses or a decrease in our results of operations as a result of difficulties or risks, including: - legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues; - accounting impairments; - difficulty in standardizing information and other systems; - difficulty in realizing operating synergies; - diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business; and - failing to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided. Moreover, any acquisition may be funded by additional debt, which could reduce our profitability and harm our business. We may also choose to enter into joint ventures, business alliances or consortia to acquire assets or other types of investments (whether under instruments, participations or subparticipations, a total return or pass-through contracts or any other similar arrangements), which could involve the same or similar risks and uncertainties as are involved in acquisitions of control. Moreover, to the extent we subsequently increase our level of participation or acquire 100% of the ----- interests in the assets of any of these joint ventures, business alliances or consortia, we may be required to pay deferred consideration.

A cyber-attack within the business or through the supply chain that impacts systems, processes, or data, compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability could result in financial losses, regulatory sanctions, and reputational damage.","Our success depends in large part on the ability to record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to access, maintain and expand the databases we use for pricing and collection activities. We also use our systems to identify large numbers of customers, store personal data of our customers, analyze and segment accounts, devise efficient collection strategies and monitor the results of collection efforts. Information stored about customers includes: personal information of the customer, such as name and account number; location information relating to the address and telephone numbers for the customer; and account-specific information such as the date of loan origination, issuance of the card or debt default, write-off date and write-off balance for the account. Furthermore, while we have various means of disaster recovery protection, the insolvency, liquidation or entering into administration of our cloud-based IT providers or the developers of our data management systems, could disrupt operations and materially adversely affect our respective businesses. ----- Our information systems could be adversely affected by events outside our control, including, without limitation, terrorist acts, natural disasters, telecommunications and network failures and power losses. Our computer systems, our data stored on third-party servers or applications by means of “cloud computing,” our software and our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access (from within our organization or by third parties), computer viruses or other malicious code and other cyber threats that could have a security impact. Cyber-attacks, in particular, have become far more prevalent in the past few years, leading potentially to the theft or manipulation of confidential and proprietary information or loss of access to, or destruction of, data on systems. If one or more of such events were to occur in respect of our systems, our data, our software or our networks, it potentially could jeopardize our confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks or thirdparty platforms, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Remote working environments are less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued remote working by our employees could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks, including heightened cyber security risks. In addition, if a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue or other event occurs that impacts the ability of our employees to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue business for a substantial period of time. Moreover, third party service providers on whom we have become increasingly reliant for certain aspects of our business, including for certain information systems, technology and the administration of certain funds, could be impacted by an inability to perform due to COVID-19 related restrictions or by failures of, or attacks on, their information systems and technology. Any material disruption to, or failure of, our systems, the systems of our third-party service providers or the systems of the banking and other sectors that are integral to our businesses, especially if it also impacts our backup or disaster recovery systems, would disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our businesses. Any temporary or permanent loss of our ability to use computer equipment and software systems, or any disruption to or loss of data could disrupt our operations, result in increased capital expenditure and insurance and operating costs, cause us to suffer a competitive disadvantage and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any security or privacy breach of our systems could expose us to liability, increase expenses relating to the resolution of these breaches, harm our reputation and deter LP investors from investing in future funds and Investment Portfolio Sellers from selling portfolios to us. We could be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. Regulators are focused on promoting the protection of customer/client information and the integrity of information technology systems of regulated firms. Our continued regulatory authorization is partially dependent on the adequacy of our IT systems and controls. Additionally, computer and telecommunications technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product life cycles. We continually upgrade our IT systems to ensure that our IT infrastructure continues to deliver appropriate flexibility, control, resilience and cost effectiveness. The change process, as well as the management of data, may result in technical or operational difficulties that may require us to remedy problems that arise, which could require ----- substantial expenditure, time and other resources. We may not be successful in anticipating, managing or adopting technological changes on a timely basis, which could reduce our profitability or disrupt our operations and harm our business. While we believe that our existing information systems are sufficient to meet our current demands and continued expansion, our future growth may require additional investment in these systems. We depend on having the capital resources necessary to invest in new technologies to acquire and service our debt portfolios. We cannot ensure you that adequate capital resources will be available to us when we need to make such investments. As part of providing asset management services to our third-party clients, we may be required to build new servicing platforms, enhance our existing servicing platforms and make improvements to our IT infrastructure that may result in technical and operational difficulties that, among other things, cause expenditure overruns against budget and delays that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, as some of the systems, technologies and programs that we use have been developed internally, our level of development documentation may not be comparable to that of third-party software packages.

Such reduced collections would negatively impact our ERC, while higher costs and lower portfolio returns would impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our modeling for future collections may be rendered less reliable if the quantity and identity of customers who may reduce their debt payments, or the amounts of such reductions, cannot be accurately predicted. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Further, we may seek to recover on customer accounts that may become subject to insolvency procedures under applicable laws and also may purchase customer accounts that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings. Various economic trends and potential changes to existing legislation may contribute to an increase in the number of consumers subject to personal insolvency procedures. Under some insolvency procedures, a person’s assets may be sold to repay creditors and, in the event that our account is unsecured, then we may be unable to collect on such customer accounts. The ability to successfully collect on our portfolios may decline with an increase in personal insolvency procedures or a change in insolvency laws, regulations, practices or procedures. In particular, in the UK, the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 made provision for a new adjudicator (this role to be undertaken by an employee of the Insolvency Service) rather than the courts to consider debtor petition applications for bankruptcy. This replaced the previous court-based procedure with an administrative process. This service started in April 2016 and is provided on a “digital-by-default” basis. An increased ease of access to bankruptcy procedure, without the need to go before a judge, might encourage more customers to take this route, which would have a corresponding reduction in our ability to collect affected debts. In addition, pursuant to the Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space Moratorium and Mental Health Crisis Moratorium) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020, customers resident in England or Wales may apply for a moratorium of up to 60 days in certain circumstances (broadly speaking, where they are unable to pay their debts as they fall due and are seeking professional advice with a view to finding an appropriate debt solution). Customers may apply for a separate, longer moratorium if they are receiving mental health crisis treatment (lasting as long as the treatment period plus 30 days). In either case, if a customer’s application for a moratorium is successful, our ----- ability to collect on the relevant account may be limited during the relevant period as (unless the relevant debt falls into certain excluded types of debt) we would be unable to take enforcement action or require a customer to pay any interest, fees, penalties and charges that would otherwise accrue during the period. Furthermore, we, and the Fund Manager on behalf of the Fund and future funds, purchase a broad range of non-performing and non-core portfolios that contain a range of assets, including but not limited to unsecured consumer debt, secured consumer debt, other secured debt, real-estate assets and commercial assets. In the event that there are changes affecting the realization of these assets, for example due to changes in real-estate prices, then the collections expected on the portfolio may be lower than our own projections when we purchased such portfolios and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Accordingly, there may be times when a number of portfolios, or particularly large portfolios, become available for purchase concurrently, which may prevent us or the Fund Manager on behalf of the Fund or future funds, from pursuing all of the purchase opportunities. The inconsistency in the availability of portfolios for purchase may mean that during certain financial reporting periods we may make few or no purchases of portfolios. This is exacerbated with the development of the Fund and Investment Management business since our Balance Sheet business typically only acquires a 25% interest in the portfolio. In addition, large purchases at the end of a financial period would likely have a material and adverse effect on our reported financial ratios. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Seasonality.”_ In addition, there are several reasons why the cash flows generated from portfolios may be uneven. As we purchase a broad range of portfolios, some of which may comprise a portion or entirely of real-estate assets, then the collection on such portfolios may be realized only when the asset is sold. In some circumstances, the collection will be maximized by incurring capital expenditure before sale and therefore, the time to realize a collection can be uncertain. Furthermore, we, and the Fund Manager on behalf of the Fund and future funds, acquire and may acquire portfolios with an uneven collections profile. For example, we have acquired a portfolio, which represents a minority interest in a lending business in the Netherlands, where the final collection represents the disposal of the underlying business and, as such, generates an uneven cash flow profile. Also, there can be a gap between the time of acquisition of a portfolio and the time that we begin earning collections and/or returns on the acquired portfolio, as we may need to locate customers, build a consolidated profile of each such customer’s circumstances, incur capital expenditure on real-estate assets and/or formulate an appropriate repayment solution or collection strategy before we can start to collect on an acquired portfolio. As a result, we may experience uneven cash flows and delays in generating income from purchased loan portfolios. For example, if we were to acquire a material portfolio at the end of a reporting period then this would increase ----- Net Debt or reduce our cash on hand without generating cash or contributing to Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period.

Our reputation is fundamental to maintaining our relationships with current and potential Investment Portfolio Sellers and clients, LP investors, other stakeholders, such as banks and bondholders, and regulators. The following events, among others, may have a negative effect on our reputation and/or our financial results: negative media publicity relating either to us or the wider debt purchase and collection industry, allegations of unethical or improper behavior by us or our third-party DCAs or other servicers, our inability to collect debt on an accurate and timely basis, our failure to respect and treat consumers fairly, failures in our collection and data protection processes, IT platforms, including IT security failure or other operational issues, failures by our fund managers to meet the obligations due to LP investors, litigation, regulatory restrictions, investigations, fines or enforcement actions. The collection of debt involves interpretations of contractual terms that may vary by debt originator, which may impact the calculation of consumers’ resulting payment obligations and the collection strategies we employ. The inherent complexity of debt calculation and historical inaccuracies may result in our failure to choose the appropriate collection strategies and could lead to incorrect payment calculations in the future. In addition, our co-investment and strategic partnership arrangements expose us to reputational and other risks related to the actions of the co-investors and partners, over whom we have no control. Any of the foregoing events could result in financial liability or reputational damage, could jeopardize our relationships with our clients and our ability to establish new client relationships, impact our ability to raise further funds to support the development of our Fund and Investment Management business, have a negative impact on a consumer’s willingness to pay a debt owed to us or to our clients, diminish our attractiveness as a counterparty or lead to increased regulation of the debt purchase and collection industry, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Online articles, blogs and tweets, in particular, can lead to the rapid dissemination of a story and increase the exposure to negative publicity about the debt purchase and debt collection industry in general or in relation to us in particular, including in relation to our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses; - the internet has websites where consumers list their concerns about the activities of debt collectors and seek online guidance from others on how to react to collection efforts mostly in the UK. These websites provide consumers with legal forms and other strategies to frustrate collection efforts and to try to avoid their obligations. To the extent that these forms and strategies are based upon erroneous legal information, the cost of collections may increase; and - consumer “blog” sites and claims management companies are common in certain jurisdictions that we operate and add to the negative attention given to the debt purchase and debt collection industry. Certain of these organizations may also enable consumers to negotiate a larger discount on their payments than we would otherwise agree to. Negative publicity could also result from our being named in published industry complaint data sites, our receiving negative attention due to internal disputes, including disputes with former employees, negative publicity in relation to our Fund and Investment Management or Asset Management and Servicing businesses, or any of our third-party DCA or other service partners having been alleged to, or having been found to, have violated the law or regulatory requirements or acted inappropriately in their conduct of business. As consumer awareness continues to increase, there may be an increase in the level of complaints. Any such negative publicity could jeopardize our existing relationships with Investment Portfolio Sellers or our ability to establish new relationships with other Investment Portfolio Sellers or impact our ability to raise further funds from LP investors in support of the development of our Fund and Investment Management business or diminish our attractiveness as a counterparty generally. Additionally, we are, and may in the future be, contractually required to reassign portfolios if a portfolio attracts negative media attention towards an Investment Portfolio Seller. Negative publicity could also result from media interest in the actions or behavior of any of our directors or senior management. Any of the foregoing could impact our ability to purchase portfolios, our ability to collect on the portfolios that we purchase, or our relationships with regulators, Investment Portfolio Sellers, DCAs, other servicers, our clients, our LP investors, our stakeholders or other market participants, and may materially adversely affect business, results of operations and financial condition. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The loss of the services of one or more of our key management team members, including Zachary Lewy (chief executive officer (“CEO”)), John Calvao (Fund Principal) and Philip Shepherd (chief commercial officer (“CCO”)) or any of our other key employees, could disrupt our operations. Further, a strategic review is being undertaken, which may result in further changes to the business, which may include changes to the organizational structure, the committee structure and / or the governance framework. Following re-registration of the Target as a private company, there may also be further changes to its organizational framework, management and governance structure. See “Management.” There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement such changes in our management and organizational structure. Any such changes may also result in the disruption of our business and operations. Some of the employment agreements that we have in place contain non-compete and confidentiality provisions that survive termination of employment. However, these agreements do not and will not assure the continued services of the senior management team members and key employees and we may not be able to enforce such non-compete and confidentiality provisions. Senior management team members maintain strong relationships with a number of the largest UK and European Investment Portfolio Sellers, as well as LP investors. The development of our Fund and Investment Management business increasingly relies on certain individuals within the Fund Manager. Further, some key employees possess important undocumented knowledge of our data analytics and technology systems. If any such employee no longer worked for us, our ability to maintain, repair or modify our data analytics systems and platforms may be reduced. Our success depends on the continued service and performance of our senior management team members and other key employees, and we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals. Further, we may not be able to continue attracting similarly qualified and skilled individuals to join our staff and senior management. In addition, under the UK regulatory Senior Managers and Certification Regime, for example, certain individuals are required to obtain FCA approval to carry on specified functions within the UK Regulated Firms (including, for example, the roles of the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and executive and non-executive directors). If a person seeking to perform a senior management function (as defined in “Regulation and Compliance—Regulatory Framework— _United Kingdom—Senior Managers and Certification Regime”) is unable to gain approval from,_ or subsequently has his or her approval withdrawn by, the FCA, he or she would be unable to perform, or continue to perform, the senior management function in question and a suitable replacement would need to be found and would need to be approved by the FCA for that role.

In pursuing legal collections, we may be unable to obtain accurate and authentic account documents for some of the accounts that we purchase.","A portion of our collections is achieved through litigation. Accordingly, a portion of our future collections will be dependent on success in individual lawsuits or court actions in the jurisdictions that we operate. When we commence collection actions through legal proceedings, courts may require legal agreements, documentation, such as a copy of the account statements or applications to be attached to the pleadings in order to obtain a judgment against a particular customer. Where we are unable to produce such legal agreements or account documents when required to do so, the account may be legally unenforceable and/or the court may not find in our favor. Furthermore, if any of the legal agreements or account documents possessed by us were found to be inaccurate, non-authentic or legally unenforceable, courts may deny, or reduce the value of, our claims. We typically rely on Investment Portfolio Sellers to provide account documentation, including notices and correspondence with accountholders, to us in an accurate and timely fashion. We may also rely on DCAs to store key information and documentation, which is especially relevant when complaints are escalated, and for the purpose of legal action further along the collections cycle. Our inability to obtain these documents from the Investment Portfolio Sellers, or our own errors in producing account documents, or DCAs’ failure to adequately store key information, may negatively impact the liquidation rate on such accounts that are subject to judicial collections. In addition, if DCAs fail to respond to communications in a timely manner, or allow any litigation or judicial process to lapse or become delayed, it may negatively impact the success of a lawsuit, and have a material adverse effect on our collections. Any changes to laws, regulations or rules that affect the manner in which we initiate enforcement proceedings, including rules affecting documentation, or shorter statutes of limitation, could result in increased administration costs or limit the availability of litigation as a collection tool, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.11,"Protocol”), which came into effect in the UK on October 1, 2017, has presented practical issues",13.11.1,"We may purchase or service portfolios that contain accounts that are not eligible to be collected, including due to defects in customer documentation that may make the customer agreements unenforceable.","In the normal course of our portfolio purchases, and in the management of any Forward Flow Agreements that we may enter into from time to time, some individual accounts may be included in the portfolios that fail to conform to the terms of the purchase contracts and we may seek to return these accounts to the Investment Portfolio Seller for payment or replacement. Such Investment Portfolio Seller may, however, be unable to meet its obligations to us or we may not identify non-conforming accounts soon enough, or at all, to qualify for recourse to the Investment Portfolio Seller. Contracts entered into with Investment Portfolio Sellers have imposed and may impose restrictions on our ability to return non-conforming accounts by imposing a minimum threshold value that must be met. Each contract specifies which accounts are eligible for return and which are not and the time period in which they must be returned to the vendor. Examples of ineligible accounts could include those that have a foreign address, have been subject to fraud, those that have an incorrect balance or those where the customer is serving time in prison. Accounts that would be eligible for recourse if discovered in a timely fashion, but that we do not discover in time for such recourse, are likely to yield no return. We may also be unable to enforce on accounts where any underlying debt documentation is legally defective. For example, the CCA and CONC contain detailed and, in some cases, prescribed requirements relating to the form, content and execution of regulated credit agreements as well as the pre-contractual and post-contractual obligations, including disclosure and documentary requirements (similar obligations are set out in MCOB in respect of regulated mortgage contracts). Non-compliance with some or all of these requirements may, for example, render customer agreements unenforceable against the borrower and result in there being no obligation on the borrower to pay interest and charges during the period of non-compliance, and may also require interest and charges that have already been collected to be refunded, in addition to potentially giving rise to regulatory enforcement action. A technical breach of some of these requirements may render the customer agreement (i.e., the underlying credit agreement) unenforceable and require us to undertake a remediation exercise that may result in balance adjustments and/or cash refunds due on the purchased accounts. In some cases, such remediation exercises may result in the amounts of compensation exceeding the purchase price and therefore resulting in total loss of the portfolio value and potentially additional expenditure on our part. While we carry out appropriate due diligence on each of the proposed purchases, the internal controls we have in place to detect fraud and errors may fail. The quality of historical customer documentation may not allow, in each case, the discovery of past breaches relating to form and content requirements which would impair our ability to correctly assess the ----- value of the portfolio, resulting in the risk of loss or reduction in the particular purchased portfolio’s value. As our business relies on our ability to enforce the contracts underlying our owned customer accounts, a contract found to be invalid or unenforceable could hinder our ability to recover from purchased accounts. If we purchase portfolios containing too many accounts that do not conform to the terms of the purchase contracts or contain accounts that are otherwise uncollectable or unenforceable, we may be unable to recover a sufficient amount, or anything at all, and such a portfolio purchase could be unprofitable. Additionally, we may be unable to ascertain whether the Investment Portfolio Seller has been in compliance in connection with the underlying accounts at a sufficiently early stage. This could lead to adverse accounting and financial consequences, such as the need to make substantial provisions against the acquired assets or to write down acquired assets. We may not be able to collect on a portfolio to which someone else held legal ownership or would need to spend time and resources establishing our own legal ownership of the portfolio if such ownership was unclear. If we are unable to provide appropriate and valid documentation to confirm our ownership of real-estate or there are additional claims on the real-estate asset, then the collection expected from the disposal of the asset may be delayed or reduced against our expectation. Similarly, if we are unable to produce account documents (which under our different purchase agreements may remain in the custody of the vendor unless requested by us) and account statements in response to a customer’s request, that account could be legally unenforceable until such time when these documents are produced. Furthermore, if any of the account documents we do have were found to be legally unenforceable, courts may deny our claims. Moreover, in instances where underlying documentation does not prove the existence, ownership or enforceability of an account, or where an account balance is incorrect, we may not always have the right to transfer such accounts back to the Investment Portfolio Seller. Additionally, in such instances, we may be contractually required to repurchase accounts that we have subsequently sold to third parties. Any changes to laws, regulations or rules or vendor approach in relation to customer treatment that affect the manner in which we initiate enforcement proceedings, including rules affecting documentation, could result in increased administration costs or limit the availability of litigation as a collection tool, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, our ability to collect by means other than legal proceedings may be impacted by laws that require that certain types of account documentation be in our possession prior to the institution of any collection activities. Further, the collectability of certain types of debt may be diminished by subsequent judicial actions. For example, two Dutch Supreme Court rulings (in 2014 and 2016) regarding the enforceability of certain types of consumer debt owed to telecommunication providers in the Netherlands, including certain portfolios purchased by the Vesting Group, have led to portions of such debts becoming uncollectable. The value of such portfolios run the risk of impairment, although the significance of such impairment depends also on the quality of the portfolios, and there may related tax effects. As a result, collecting currently outstanding claims of this type became more complicated, time-consuming and costly. At this point in time, the lack of a uniform approach to enforcement in the court system makes it difficult to provide clarity regarding the ----- actual impact on the value of the portfolios affected by the rulings. Although we have an indemnity from the sellers of the Vesting Group, and it is possible that we may be able to claim damages from the Investment Portfolio Sellers of the affected portfolios directly on the basis of a contractual undertaking, we may not be able to collect on such indemnities and undertakings in full or at all, and may incur costs in pursuing such claims. As would be the case for purchased portfolios, we may also be prohibited from collecting in whole or in part on, or become subject to regulatory intervention, litigation and fines in respect of, portfolios owned by third parties for which we render asset management or other services. For example, the AFM conducted an industry-wide thematic review of providers and intermediaries of consumer credit in relation to Dutch consumers who had taken out relatively high interest products and then found themselves unable to refinance those products due to tightening lending criteria across the consumer credit market. The Vesting Group acts as a servicer for certain portfolios and following the thematic AFM review, the AFM requested certain modifications to a serviced portfolio which may decreases its value. Notwithstanding the AFM requirements and the Vesting Group’s regulatory obligations, the owners of this portfolio (who are not subject to AFM jurisdiction, as the Vesting Group entities are) have objected to some of these modifications and may pursue legal action against the Vesting Group, for implementing the AFM’s requirements. We believe we would have meritorious defenses, if any legal action was pursued, and would vigorously defend against, any such legal action were it brought.

These positions may relate to such matters as tax compliance, sales and use value-added tax, permanent establishment, transfer pricing, deductibility of expenses, classification of income, treaty relief, withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues. Furthermore, the development of the Fund and Investment Management business has increased the activities and number of tax jurisdictions that we operate in. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views taken by us. We are subject to periodic tax audits by the tax authorities and any challenges made by tax authorities to our application of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, as a result of the impairment of ERC during the first half of 2020 and as reflected in our results for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group incurred certain tax losses within the UK. If we are unable to generate profits in the future, then we will be unable to set-off these losses. Further, the anti-avoidance provision (Section 673 of Corporation Tax Act of 2010) states that any losses can be forfeited if within a period of five years of such loss, there is a change in the ownership of a company and a major change in the nature of conduct of the trade of that company. As a result, there is a risk that we may be unable to set-off some or all of our losses sustained during 2020. Our effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in UK or overseas tax laws or the interpretation of UK or overseas tax laws, including those tax laws relating to the utilization of tax loss or credit carry forwards, and changes in our assessment of certain matters. Our effective tax rate in any given financial year reflects a variety of factors, including the mix of profit generated in each jurisdiction, that may not be present in the succeeding financial year or years. One factor affecting our effective tax rate is the relevant standard rate of corporation tax in the various jurisdictions that we operate in, which is subject to change. For instance, at the March 2021 United Kingdom budget, the UK government announced an increase to the rate of UK corporation tax for the year commencing April 1, 2023, and set the rate at 25% which was approved with the passing into law of the Finance Act 2021 on June 10, 2021.

For example, ----- there has been a substantial increase in the UK in consumer claims being brought through the courts and before the FOS in attempts to claim refunds of sums paid under loan agreements or to avoid making payments going forward. This litigation has increased, and may increase further, due to the number and level of activity of claims management companies that advertise for potential claimants and then help them to bring claims in the hope and expectation that they will be paid a portion of any debt written off. Claims could also be brought in relation to other areas of alleged non-compliance with regulation or in relation to minor technical breaches of form and content requirements, which could affect a large portfolio of agreements. Breaches may have occurred prior to our acquisitions of portfolios and extends across all the jurisdictions that we operate in, which could result in regulatory penalties and costs associated with providing redress to customers affected. In addition, any publicity relating to breaches by our competitors could result in an increased number of customer complaints, FOS or court claims (including group claims and claims management companies’ activity) and, more generally, alter customers’ behavior in making repayments. The focus and awareness on the consumer credit and consumer mortgage servicing sectors and for example the highly publicized work being undertaken by the FCA may result in more cases of alleged non-compliance and more customer complaints as customers become more aware of potential instances of malpractice. We may in the future be named as defendants in litigation or administrative proceedings, including under consumer credit, tax, collections, employment, competition and other laws or government audits and proceedings. Such claims against us, including bulk litigation, regardless of merit, could lead to costly litigation and divert management personnel from their regular responsibilities. Furthermore, if such claims are adversely determined against us, we could be forced to suspend certain collection efforts or pay damages, be subject to enforcement orders or have our registration with a particular regulator revoked, and our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, claims management companies and consumer rights groups could increase their focus on the debt collection industry and, in particular, the collection of debts owed under regulated agreements. Such negative publicity or attention could result in increased litigation against us, including class action suits. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in consumers’ propensity to bring claims related to debt collection to the courts in their attempts to claim refunds of sums paid under consumer credit agreements or to avoid making payments going forward. This litigation has been fueled by a substantial rise in claims management companies that aggressively advertise for potential claimants and then bring claims in the hope and expectation that they will be paid a portion of any debt written off. Substantial complaint volumes have been made in the UK in relation to premiums for mis-sold payment protection insurance (which can form part of the debt being collected) and other types of charges added onto credit accounts. Claims could also be brought in relation to other areas of alleged noncompliance, which could affect a large portfolio of agreements. We may in the future be named as defendants in litigation, including under consumer credit, collections and other laws.

For example, certain law firm parties with whom we ----- contract for collection services have asserted claims against us relating to our agreed fee structure and, in connection with the winding down of similar relationships with other business partners, we may face additional claims. Such claims against us, complaints, disputes or disagreements, regardless of merit, could result in or subject us to costly litigation and divert our management personnel from their regular responsibilities.

These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered by management to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time. These estimates and assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Areas requiring more complex judgements may shift over time, based on changes in accounting policies or on changes in our business profile. More complex judgements are required in relation to revenue recognition, including impairment gains/losses and fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) changes on our purchased loan portfolios and judgements relating to cash flow forecasts. For example, the estimates used in the effective interest rate (“EIR”) and FVTPL ----- methods of revenue recognition to calculate the projected Gross IRR on our loan portfolios are primarily based on forecast cash collections and/or valuations. If actual future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing than the ERC, our earnings could be affected, either positively or negatively. Higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected will have a favorable impact on revenue in the form of yield increases, impairment reversals and/or FVTPL gains. In addition, higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected will have the effect of reducing the expected future value of our loan portfolios, requiring us to purchase additional loan portfolios in order to maintain our level of expected future cash flows, which we might not be able to do. Lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected will have an unfavorable impact and may result in impairments and/or FVTPL losses on our loan portfolios. Impairments and FVTPL cause reduced and fluctuating earnings. In the future, the areas requiring more complex judgement will change as a result of the development of our Fund and Investment Management business, for example concerning the revenue recognition of performance fees.

It is our policy to predominantly hedge this exposure, but, to the extent that these exposures are not hedged, the exchange rate fluctuations could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As we increase our investments to euro-denominated portfolios and with the development of our Fund and Investment Management business that receives euro fee income, the related currency translation risks are expected to increase and, to the extent we rely on our revenue in pounds sterling to service our euro-denominated indebtedness or vice versa, changes in the value of pounds sterling relative to the euro may increase the proportion of revenue we need to devote to our debt service obligations and adversely affect our financial results. See “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure of Market Risk—Foreign currency risk—Foreign currency sensitivity analysis.”_ To the extent that we purchase portfolios in other jurisdictions, it would be subject to similar currency translation risk between the currency of such jurisdiction and pounds sterling.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are not cash flow hedges are reported in income, and accordingly could materially adversely affect our reported income in any period. Hedging activities also involve the risk of an imperfect correlation between the hedging instrument and the asset being hedged, which could result in losses on both the hedging transaction and the instrument being hedged. Use of hedging activities may not prevent significant losses. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the risk that our counterparty in a derivative transaction is unable to perform its obligations as a result of becoming subject to an insolvency procedure.

As a result, the shareholders conducted limited diligence in connection with the Acquisition. As such, due to the limited scope of the diligence conducted, there may be liabilities that were not discovered in the course of the due diligence investigations into the Target Group in connection with the Acquisition. For example, we could become liable for overdue payables of the Target Group to employees that are not currently known to us, or could become subject to tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of which we may have underestimated. There can be no assurance that the due diligence undertaken by us has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating the Acquisition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during the due diligence exercise or that such information was accurate and remained accurate through the conclusion of the due diligence exercise. The due diligence process is inherently subjective. If the due diligence investigation failed to identify material information regarding the Acquisition, we may later be forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business plan for the Target Group or incur impairment or other charges. Similarly, if the materialization of certain risks, which may or may not have been identified during due diligence, occur, such materialization may lead to a loss of property, loss of value and, potentially, subsequent contractual and statutory liability to various parties. Any such undiscovered liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Target Group.

These non-IFRS measures and other information are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our performance. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. However, these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and other risks and may differ materially from our actual financial condition or results of operations. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) included in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC and certain measures would be prohibited from inclusion in documents furnished or filed with the SEC. Certain of these amounts have not been, and, in certain cases cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. In particular, Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA and ratios derived therefrom seek to adjust our financial results to give effect to certain nonrecurring items, the effect of contract wins prior to June 30, 2021 (including the contract with Tesco Bank that was concluded in third quarter of 2021) and increases in revenues from management fees generated by the Fund for investments which have already been committed. The adjustments made to calculate Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances but are included for illustrative purposes only and have not been audited. Runrate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA are not comparable to the audited results and should not be regarded as a substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by multiplying our Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021 by two and based on estimated cost-savings opportunities including those which have been identified by an external consultant in connection with the Acquisition. Given the run rate estimate of costs savings, it is likely that Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA will differ from actual results for the period. In particular, this run rate calculation is based on specific benchmark data and assumptions which may vary from the cost saving initiatives we ultimately implement. We are still devising detailed bottom-up plans with respect to the exact amounts, timing and the nature of the cost savings initiatives to be implemented to realize such cost savings. Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA and adjustments are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to project our consolidated results of operations for any future period and may not be reflective of the actual results for any period. Such information has not been audited, reviewed or verified and you should not place ----- undue reliance thereon or regard such information as a substitute for the audited consolidated financial data of AGG or financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS. The foregoing financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. None of the adjustments, estimates or run rate calculations have been audited by any independent auditors and should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the events for which we have made the adjustment, estimate or calculation been completed as the dates stated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or financial position.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 97% of the total revenue for the Asset Management and Servicing and Fund and Investment businesses, together with the total collections received by the Balance Sheet business, were received directly by Restricted Group.

The debt under our Revolving Facility Agreement will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to compounding overnight the Sterling Overnight Index Average published by the Bank of England (“SONIA”) plus a spread adjustment for loans denominated in pounds sterling, EURIBOR for loans denominated in euro or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for loans denominated in U.S. dollars, in each case plus an applicable margin. These rates could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be ----- available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements and that we may be required to satisfy margin calls. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the debt under our Euro Floating Rate Notes and Revolving Facility Agreement, to the extent not fixed by means of hedging arrangements, would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. As a consequence of regulatory reforms, the common maturities of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease to be published as panel bank rates after June 30, 2023 (and all other LIBOR settings for all currencies will cease as panel bank rates after December 31, 2021). It is not known if or when regulatory reform may, in the future, cause EURIBOR to cease or be replaced. The U.S. dollar floating rate market is currently expected to transition to use, in place of U.S. dollar LIBOR, a floating rate equal to compounding overnight SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve in the U.S.) plus a spread adjustment, by not later than the time that the relevant U.S. dollar LIBOR setting is to cease as a panel bank rate, although other alternative rates may also be used. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on any of our debt linked to such a benchmark. Regulatory requirements under the EU Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to EURIBOR) and under the UK Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to LIBOR) may: (i) discourage market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a regulated benchmark (such as EURIBOR or LIBOR); (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used for the benchmark or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the benchmark. The scheduled cessation of the LIBOR benchmark as a panel bank rate or any proposal to cease the determination or publication of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which the relevant benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in any affected benchmark, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any floating rate debt linked to that benchmark and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, including the Euro Floating Rate Notes, reducing cash flows otherwise available for our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and servicing our debt obligations. The Indenture will provide that, in the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, is no longer generally representative of the underlying market which EURIBOR seeks to represent on the Issue Date or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the euro zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, the rate of interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will thereafter be determined on an alternative basis by reference to any successor rate (including any generally accepted adjustment spread) generally accepted in the euro zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities which originally referenced EURIBOR, as identified by the Issuer in good faith. However, in the event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgement of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for ----- determining the rate of interest (and any applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to holders of the Euro Floating Rate Notes as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR) on the Euro Floating Rate Notes (and any such alternative basis adopted will in all cases never be less than 0.0%). This means that interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes would be determined by the Issuer on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Euro Floating Rate Notes issued on the Issue Date. The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the consent of the holders of the Euro Floating Rate Notes.

Our ability to make payments on our debt also depends on our cash flow cycle. If our interest payment dates coincide with periods of significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay our obligations as they come due.

In particular, the continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have adversely affected our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations.

There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. In addition, there is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among other things, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair market value of the Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In addition, the Collateral will not include all of our assets. We believe our purchased loan portfolios represent the significant majority of the value of the Collateral. These assets, in particular, may be subject to significant changes in value due to ----- economic or regulatory trends. In addition, it may be challenging for you to realize the value of our purchased loan portfolios as these are financial assets, not physical assets, and represent liabilities of non-performing consumers. Consumer debt receivables typically decline in value over time. To realize the value of the Collateral, you may need to rely on third-party collection resources. If you have to rely on third parties, you may be required to make significant upfront payments to cover collection expenses. In addition, the institutions from which we purchase receivables may be unwilling to provide you with the account level documentation you may need to successfully collect on accounts, which may significantly reduce the realizable value of the Collateral for you. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of this Collateral will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangements governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, if at all. Proceeds from enforcement sales of capital stock and assets that are part of the Collateral must first be applied in discharging sums owing to certain creditor representatives and the Security Agent as well as enforcement costs, then satisfaction of obligations under the Revolving Facility Agreement, any Hedging Agreements (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and certain operating facilities (if any) and thereafter to repay on a pari passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Notes and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Indenture will allow incurrence of certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a priority or pari passu basis. The incurrence of any additional debt secured by the Collateral would reduce amounts available to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral. To the extent that other first priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Revolving Facility Agreement and the Indenture and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, the parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Collateral. The Collateral includes shares of the Additional Guarantors, certain of which are UK Regulated Firms. As regulated firms, the Additional Guarantors that are UK Regulated Firms are subject to the change of control regime under Part XII of FSMA and, accordingly, any enforcement in respect of the shares of such regulated firms will be subject to change of control approvals, which may delay or otherwise impair the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such shares. Moreover, the security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce, or to preserve and maximize value in connection with the enforcement of, a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

If any such security interest is created or perfected after the Issue Date, it may be treated under bankruptcy law (in certain of the Guarantor jurisdictions) as if it were delivered to secure previously existing debt, which is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if the steps were taken at the time of the Issue Date. To the extent that the grant or perfection of any such security interest is avoided as a preference, you would lose the benefit of such security interest.

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Transaction Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) will provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the applicable Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of ----- security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure has not (explicitly) been tested in the courts of these jurisdictions and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement, diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral or Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The definition of “covered fund” in the Volcker Rule includes, among other things, any entity that would be an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act but for the exclusion provided under Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer and each of the Guarantors relies on Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S. Investment Company Act for their exclusion from registration thereunder (which limits sales of the Notes to “qualified purchasers” as such term is defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act), they will be considered “covered funds” for purposes of the Volcker Rule in the absence of an exclusion from the definition of “covered fund.” Accordingly, “banking entities” (as defined under the Volcker Rule) that are subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited or limited under the Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or any of the Guarantors as a “covered fund,” in the absence of an applicable exemption under the Volcker Rule. Depending on market conditions, this could significantly and negatively affect the liquidity and market value of the Notes and the Guarantees. ----- “Ownership interest” is broadly defined under the Volcker Rule to include any equity, partnership or other similar interest, and the phrase “other similar interest” is further defined to include, in part, any participation or other interest that entitles the holder of such interest to, among other things: (a) participate in the selection or removal of management or otherwise (other than as a creditor exercising remedies upon an event of default or acceleration event and to participate in the removal of an investment manager for “cause” (as defined therein) or in the selection of a replacement manager upon an investment manager’s resignation or removal), (b) share in the income, gains or profits of the “covered fund”, (c) receive underlying assets of the “covered fund” after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (other than as a creditor exercising remedies upon an event of default or acceleration event), (d) receive all or a portion of excess spread (as defined therein), (e) provide under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the “covered fund” with respect to the interest can be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the “covered fund”, (f) receive income on a pass-through basis from the “covered fund” or have a rate of return that is determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the “covered fund”, or (g) any synthetic right to have, receive or be allocated any of the rights in clauses (a) through (f) above. On June 25, 2020, the relevant federal regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule released a final rule to amend certain parts of the Volcker Rule’s covered fund related restrictions. The changes are intended to improve and streamline certain aspects of the “covered funds” portion of the Volcker Rule, including by, among other aspects, making modifications to certain existing exclusions from the definition of “covered fund,” creating certain new exclusions from the definition of “covered fund,” and making certain clarifications to the definition of “ownership interest.” The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020. The Volcker Rule may restrict or discourage the acquisition of Notes and the Guarantees by “banking entities” and may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and the Guarantees. Each purchaser of the Notes must make its own determination as to whether it is a “banking entity” subject to the Volcker Rule and, if applicable, the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on its ability to purchase or retain any such Notes. Investors in the Notes and the Guarantees are responsible for analyzing their own regulatory position and any liquidity in connection therewith and on its portfolio generally, and should consult with their own counsel as to the potential consequences of the Volcker Rule before making an investment decision. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Security Agent, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes and the Guarantees regarding the treatment of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors under the Volcker Rule, or to such investor’s investment in the Notes and the Guarantees on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Revolving Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our Revolving Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from members of the Group to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. In addition, under the terms of the Revolving Facility Agreement, under certain circumstances, we are required to repay an equal amount of debt and cancel the corresponding commitments under our Revolving Facility Agreement if we repay all or a portion of the principal under the Notes. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we may require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that the Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Facility Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” ----- The change of control provision to be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” under the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed not to be a change of control if a defined consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed a certain level in connection with such event. In the event the Parent is sold to a new investor, irrespective of whether such sale constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, no assurance can be given that any such investor will continue to implement our current business and financial strategy. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the _Notes—Certain definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Parent’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction.

If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Guarantees.

Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes unless and until definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or any other paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture. Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including enforcement of security for the Notes and the Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange being granted, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.

In addition, because the majority of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the majority of the assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts.

Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against the independent auditors. Investors in and purchasers of the Notes should understand that consistent with guidance issued by ICAEW, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the independent auditors’ reports included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum each state that: the report has been prepared for the named parties (the “Addressees”) solely in response to a request from the Addressees for an opinion from the independent auditors on the truth and fairness of the nonstatutory directors’ reports and financial statements; that the report was designed to meet the agreed requirements of the Addressees determined by their needs at the time; the report should not therefore be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights against the independent auditors other than the Addressees for any purpose or in any context; any ----- party other than the Addressee(s) who obtains access to the report or a copy and chooses to rely on the report (or any part of it) will do so at its own risk; and to the fullest extent permitted by law, the independent auditors will accept no responsibility or liability in respect of the report to any other party. In the context of the Offering, the independent auditors have reconfirmed to us that they do not intend their duty of care in respect of their audits to extend to any party, such as investors in and purchasers of the Notes, other than the Addressees of their reports. Without in any way, or on any basis, affecting, adding to or extending the independent auditors’ duties and responsibilities to the Addressees or giving rise to any duty or responsibility being accepted or assumed by or imposed on the independent auditors to any party except the Addressees, the independent auditors have provided consent to the Issuer’s inclusion, independently of the independent auditors, of the audit reports with the non-statutory historical financial statements to which they relate in this Offering Memorandum for a proposed issuance of Notes, thereby demonstrating that an audit of the non-statutory directors’ reports and financial statements for each relevant period has been undertaken for the Addressees. The consent provided by the independent auditors is different from a consent filed with the SEC under Section 7 of the U.S. Securities Act, which is applicable only to transactions involving securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act. As the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, the independent auditors have not filed a consent under Section 7 of the U.S. Securities Act. The independent auditors’ reports on the historical financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language set out above, the recourse that investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their reports or the non-statutory directors’ reports and financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which independent auditors may have responsibility or liability to third parties can be unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom. The inclusion of the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of holders of the Notes to bring any action against the independent auditors for damages arising out of an investment in or purchase of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate. The FTT could, if introduced in the form proposed in 2013, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market transactions would be exempt and therefore the issuance of Notes in this Offering should be exempt if the FTT were to be in existence on the Issue Date. Should the FTT be adopted, secondary market transactions in the Notes could become taxable in certain circumstances, which could materially adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and their price in the secondary market. ----- Under the proposal, the FTT would be a tax primarily on “financial institutions” in relation to “financial transactions” (which would include the conclusion or modification of derivative contracts and the purchase and sale of financial instruments). Under the current proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it could apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or may be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional Member States may decide to participate, although certain Member States have expressed strong objections to the proposal. It is unclear whether, and if so when and in what form, an FTT could be imposed.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"Established in 2005, we are a leading European investor and asset manager of debt in the non-performing and non-core assets sector, principally operating in the UK, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy and the Republic of Ireland (“Ireland”). As of June 30, 2021, we had £4.8 billion of FUM, £1,028 million in portfolio investments, £1,572 million 84-month ERC, £1,733 million 120-month ERC, and, in the six months ended June 30, 2021, generated Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the amount of £90.7 million. We operate as an integrated asset manager, a unique model with three operating divisions that provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. See “Business—Our businesses” and “— _Our Business Model.” Our model focuses on generating higher levels of capital-light revenue and,_ as such, is a comparatively less capital-intensive model than many other businesses that operate in our sector. Our three operating divisions are detailed below: 1. _Fund and Investment Management: Our Fund and Investment Management business invests third-party committed capital on behalf of our clients and includes the management of our inaugural discretionary closed-end fund, Arrow Credit Opportunities (the “Fund”), with total capital commitments of €1.7 billion, together with Norfin, Europa Investimenti and Sagitta; 2. _Asset Management and Servicing: Our Asset Management and Servicing platforms service and manage collections and other activities related to portfolio investments, on behalf of both our Fund and Investment Management business and our Balance Sheet business, as well as third-party clients. We have built market-leading positions, niche-dominant platforms and competitive servicing platforms, with expertise in consumer, real estate, mortgage and SME non-performing loans (“NPLs”) and non-core asset servicing across the five jurisdictions in which we operate; and 3. _Balance Sheet: Our Balance Sheet business invests our own capital. Since the deployment of the Fund in 2020, our investments have typically been made by way ----- of a co-investment alongside the Fund, via a 100% owned Jersey partnership, Arrow Global SMA I LP (“Arrow SMA”). Going forward, we expect the Balance Sheet business to function primarily for the purpose of co-investment activities alongside the Fund as well as any future funds. We may, however, continue to make direct investments through this business for certain strategic reasons. The Balance Sheet business also incorporates the financial performance of the back book portfolio investments made prior to the launch of the Fund. Our businesses provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. Our Fund and Investment Management business, benefiting from our 15-year track record of delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns, invests on behalf of our Balance Sheet business, with typically 25% coinvestment in new portfolio investments alongside the Fund, and approximately 71% of these portfolio investments are currently serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing platforms. We identify, acquire and service a wide range of secured and unsecured defaulted and noncore loan and real estate portfolios primarily from financial institutions, such as banks, institutional fund investors and specialist lenders, playing an active role in helping financial institutions reduce their balance sheets and re-capitalize in order to increase mainstream lending. By purchasing and managing NPLs and other non-core assets, we provide valuable capital and expertise to a growing European market. Our purpose is to help build better financial futures for our customers, clients, communities, employees and other stakeholders. As such, great importance is placed on achieving fair outcomes for customers through affordable repayment programs and helping them improve their credit score. We believe that we are one of the leading providers of debt purchase and receivables management solutions in the territories in which we operate. Through our platforms we have developed local knowledge of acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets. We offer a differentiated and diversified European NPL strategy by leveraging our deep local expertise across the five key European jurisdictions in which we operate. Our relevant track record and experience having operated in each of our core markets for a long time as well as our familiarity with each asset class provides us with a competitive advantage that is supported by local and experienced “on-the-ground” teams. In addition, our presence in these jurisdictions enables us to target smaller transactions in more sophisticated granular assets where local knowledge provides a competitive advantage and supports the creation of relationships with debt originators, enabling origination of off-market deals (i.e., deals not acquired through a process involving a competitive bid or an auction-like process). Our ability to meet our targets and deliver consistently high IRR on our portfolio investments is premised on several factors including our experienced investment professionals, our local expertise in acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets, our strong origination capabilities with broad reach enabling us to acquire a high level of off-market deals and our leading data analytics capabilities. Our proprietary database incorporates more than 15 years of collection and payment data, over 1,000 deals underwritten since our inception, 10 million customer accounts and over 10,000 of underlying properties across multiple geographies. As we accelerate our movement towards a capital-light strategy, which ----- focuses more on the growth of the Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses, and less on our Balance Sheet business, this will result in a change in our financial characteristics. See “—Our Business Model.” As part of this shift, it is our intention that our integrated fund manager business model delivers: - an increase in FUM, with a similar or reduced level of portfolio investments held by our Balance Sheet business; - an increase in the proportion of the earnings of the business derived from our capital light businesses; - an ability to target higher return on capital invested through a reduced use of our own balance sheet to provide returns; and - an increase in cash generation as capital-light revenues grow and less cash is required for re-investment in our own balance sheet assets, with a concomitant ability to delever the business. To support our transition to a capital-light strategy, we will leverage our strong track record and experience in working with partners through our historic co-investments as well as our longstanding relationships with many of the largest institutional investors in the market. The Fund represented the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally in 2020, the third largest credit fundraise in special situations globally in 2020 and the fourth largest private credit fundraise in Europe. Our track record of generating superior returns during economic dislocation combined with LP investors’ demand for private debt strategies provides a strong platform to continue to raise private funds for yield-seeking investors and our transition into a more profitable capitallight model.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Our Business Model,17.2.1,Our business model: Fund and Investment Management business.,"Our Fund and Investment Management business, which comprises ACML, together with Europa Investimenti, Sagitta and Norfin, generates income by providing services in relation to the discretionary and semi-discretionary allocation and management of third-party capital. For the six month period ended June 30, 2021, the Fund and Investment Management business generated an EBITDA of £7.6 million, equating to 12.4% of the Group’s EBITDA (pre-Acquisition costs) for the same period, at an EBITDA Margin of 30.7%. Typically, income is generated through management fees and in addition, LP investors incentivize the Fund Manager through performance fees. Management fees for fund and investment management services are normally calculated based on a fixed percentage of the value of assets managed and deducted from customers’ account balances on a regular basis. Income from fund and investment management services is recognized over time as the services are provided. In addition to the management and performance fees that we collect, we charge investors “designated charges,” which enables attributable costs to be re-charged to the Fund and future funds. In addition, these operations drive revenues for our other businesses in two ways: first, portfolio purchases by the Fund will be serviced on Arrow platforms, at market-referenced rates, driving earnings within our Asset Management and Servicing business, with approximately 71% of portfolios purchased currently being serviced by our platforms; and second, our Balance Sheet business will typically co-invest alongside the Fund and drive revenue and collections from the acquired portfolios. Under the Fund, a co-investment of 25% is typical, but we expect this to reduce over time to 10% as we raise new funds with anticipated lower co-investment levels. Returns from these co-investments and from servicing on the Arrow platforms are recorded under the Balance Sheet business and Asset Management and Servicing business results. ----- Management fees paid for the Fund are predominantly generated on the net asset value of FUM (although larger LP investors in the Fund were charged discounted management fee rates) with our target rate being 1.75% and are paid to the Fund Manager. There is also a small charge on committed capital designed to cover expenses from certain LP investors. Given that the life of the Fund is eight years (comprised of a three year investment period coupled with a five year distribution period), with a potential extension to a maximum of ten years, we anticipate that these management fees will provide relatively steady cash flows on the investments made by the Fund. As we raise additional funds, we expect these management fees to become a significantly larger part of our revenue streams, as we seek to increase our FUM and drawn capital and also reduce the levels of discounts offered, delivering closer to target management fees. LP investors also incentivize the Fund Manager through performance fees. Performance fees are generated based on outperformance over a specified “hurdle” rate, which for the Fund is 7% - 8% Net Deal IRR (to LP investors), after which the Fund Manager, through its ownership of the general partner, is entitled to a certain percentage of the returns above that level. In respect of the Fund, returns over the aforementioned 7% - 8% Net Deal IRR will be split generally in line with an 80:20 ratio between the LP investors (80%) and the general partner (20%). Assuming that LP investors receive the target 13% Net Deal IRR, we expect to receive a 40% share of the performance fee or carried interest accruing to the general partner, culminating in an indicative performance fee in the amount of approximately €50 million, with recognition expected between 2024 and 2026. We also anticipate that the percentage level of carried interest accruing to us will increase for subsequent future funds. The Fund and Investment Management business also generates income from the Balance Sheet business, through an intra-segmental charge. These commercial charges cover portfolio management services relating to the assets held on our balance sheet at a rate of 150bps on net asset value of the back-book assets and for Arrow SMA based on a rate of 175bps during 2020 and 150bps from January 1, 2021 on drawn capital during the investment period. The total blended fee rate for the financial year 2020 for our Fund and Investment Management business was 0.9% of FUM, partly reflecting the discounts offered to LP investors in the Fund (some LP investors pay modest fees of up to 25 bps on committed capital) and the typically lower fees generated by Norfin and Sagitta. We are targeting FUM of approximately €10 billion (over £8.4 billion) and balance sheet debts of less than £1 billion by the end of 2025 (equating to an approximately 70% increase from our FUM of €4.8 billion (representing approximately £4.1 billion) and £1.3 billion total borrowings as at June 30, 2021) through the growth of our existing funds and the establishment of new funds. However, there can be no assurance that we will achieve such target within the estimated time frames or at all.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Our Business Model,17.2.2,Our business model: Asset Management and Servicing business,"Our Asset Management and Servicing business, which comprises the servicing platforms operating in the UK, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands and Ireland, generates revenues by charging servicing fees to entities owning assets. Income from contracts with our clients, which will include ----- our Balance Sheet business and the Fund, are measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with the client. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation related to a service we have undertaken to provide to a client. Servicing income makes up the majority of the income of the Asset Management and Servicing business, and in itself comprises a broad range of services, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization, legal title holding, due diligence activities, initial platform migration and on-boarding activities, master servicing, securitization vehicle set-up and ongoing management activities, new origination activities, litigation and court process management and third-party sub-servicer management. In all material cases, the services are provided at a point in time that corresponds to the satisfaction of the related performance obligations. As such, revenue arising from servicing income is normally recognized as and when the services are provided to the client, with no deferral or acceleration of revenue across the life of the contract. Income from our Asset Management and Servicing business remained robust through 2020 at £125.4 million compared with £128.8 million in 2019, demonstrating the resilience of this capital-light income stream through a significant economic downturn. Further, we have had resilient third party income growth during the first half of 2021, 12.6% higher than during the first half of 2020. Throughout 2020, we secured a record 26 new contract wins and during the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2021, we recorded a further 11 contract wins. Furthermore, on August 17, 2021, we announced plans to acquire the collections and recoveries operations within Tesco Bank’s Customer Service division. This partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced service to customers in financial difficulty by providing the necessary support and flexibility they will need in the future, with Tesco Bank choosing to partner with us, given our customer focus, proven expertise, technology platform and the cultural alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The partnership is expected to result in in our taking on over 200 Tesco Bank personnel on November 1, 2021. We believe we are well placed to win further new third-party contracts as a servicing partner for financial institutions which require additional collections capacity with growing NPL volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we believe the Asset Management and Servicing business has opportunities to grow revenues through business created by the Fund. As of June 30, 2021, 71% of the Fund purchases were being serviced on our platforms. The Fund pays a market referenced fee for such servicing. As a result, we anticipate that the Asset Management and Servicing business will be in a strong position for future growth in line with the growth of our Fund and Investment Management business. For the six month period ended June 30, 2021, the EBITDA of the Asset Management and Servicing business was £6.2 million, equating to 10.1% of the Group’s EBITDA (preAcquisition costs) for the same period, at an EBITDA Margin of 9.7%. We expect that the profitability for the Asset Management and Servicing business will steadily increase as we continue to develop our operational efficiency. The Asset Management and Servicing business EBITDA Margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 12.4% (2019: 17.9%) and the Group seeks to target a 25% EBITDA Margin from the business by 2025 by way of increased operational efficiencies, the vertical alignment of our business and the resulting heightened accountability of the business leaders in the jurisdictions in which we operate. There can be no assurance that we will achieve such targets within the targeted time frames or at all.

Since the launch of the Fund, our investments typically represent a co-investment alongside Arrow SMA. Revenue is recognized based on the effective interest rate method. In summary, the returns represent the cash collections of the portfolio less the initial cost, any upfront costs incurred at the time of acquisition and all costs associated with collection and servicing activity on the portfolio. For the six month period ended June 30, 2021, the total income generated by the Balance Sheet business was £105.1 million while the 84-month ERC and the 120-month ERC for the same period was £1,572 million and £1,733 million, respectively. We originally operated solely as a balance sheet investor in UK NPLs and have expanded into a multi-asset class and multi-geographical investor and, through our sophisticated origination, underwriting, portfolio management and servicing capabilities, have built a consistent track record of delivering strong returns through the economic cycle. We use a number of metrics in our underwriting process, with the key metric being Net Deal IRR. Revenue from the Balance Sheet business is therefore sensitive to the Net Deal IRR at underwriting, any under or over performance of collections against the Net Deal IRR at underwriting and the volume of portfolio investments. The table below shows our track record since 2010. Net Deal IRR represents actual collections achieved plus expected future collections, as shown below as at December 31, 2019, December 21, 2020 and June 30, 2021 to demonstrate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent performance:",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Essentially, the Fund and Investment Management business originates new investment opportunities that our Balance Sheet business can co-invest into, thereby creating additional opportunities for our Asset Management and Servicing business to service such investments. Each business line has its own financial characteristics. For the six month period ended June 30, 2021, the revenue mix of the three branches of our business (as a percentage of our total revenue) was as follows: the Balance Sheet business produced 54% of our total revenue, the Asset Management and Servicing business contributed to 33% of our total revenue and the Fund and Investment Management business yielded 13% of our total revenue. The planned shift towards growing our earnings through increased income generated from our collection of management fees in the Fund and Investment Management business, together with stable servicing income derived from the Asset Management and Servicing business and less of a dependency on our Balance Sheet ----- business – a plan which we refer to as our “capital-light” businesses model – is expected to result in a change in our business’ revenue mix and the financial characteristics of the Group (as compared to our historical figures), both of which have historically been weighted more towards the Balance Sheet business. As part of this shift, it is our intention to deliver: - an increase in FUM coupled with a steady reduction in the level of portfolio investments held by our Balance Sheet business in the future, - an increase in the proportion of revenues and earnings derived from our capital-light businesses, - higher return on capital invested driven by reduced use of our own balance sheet to provide returns, and - an increase in cash generation as capital-light revenues grow and less cash is required for re-investment through our own Balance Sheet business, with a concomitant ability to reduce leverage.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

There are, however, a number of arrangements in place to ensure that approximately 100% of the economics generated by the Fund Manager, including fund management and performance fees, accrue to the Restricted Group. In summary, these are that: - the Fund Manager pays for services provided to it by members of the Group which are Restricted Subsidiaries. These payments include 100% of designated charges and certain deal costs, as well as approximately 75% of all the management fees that the Fund Manager generates (the 75% of management fees is in line with transfer pricing tax arrangements and reflects the proportion of services that members of the Group deliver in Jersey as compared to other territories); and - Arrow Global Limited holds preferred ordinary shares in the Fund Manager, which entitles Arrow Global Limited to 100% of all dividends distributed by the Fund Manager. ----- As such, although the Fund Manager and its Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture and therefore not subject to the restrictions under the Indenture, and sit outside of the Restricted Group of companies, the distributions on the preferred ordinary shares detailed above and the fees and economics generated by the Fund Manager flow to the Restricted Group with the Fund Manager only retaining sufficient revenue to cover its costs. By way of illustration, 97% of the collections and revenues (i.e., cash collections plus income from our Asset Management and Servicing and Fund and Investment Management businesses, together with other income which amounted to £436 million) earned in 2020 were received directly into the Restricted Group, while a further 3% was received indirectly by the Restricted Group by way of the mechanisms detailed above.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Improved economic conditions may have a positive effect on our business. However, a deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions in the jurisdictions that we operate may lead to some or all of the following consequences, as well as other matters that we may be unaware of: (a) an increase in unemployment, inflation or other factors affecting the ability of customers to repay their debt will reduce the level of collections and reduce returns; (b) a reduction or weakness in real estate prices may reduce or delay our ability to sell assets and will also reduce the level of collections and reduce returns; (c) increase the level of defaults within the market, resulting in an increase in Investment Portfolio Sellers’ propensity to sell non-performing or non-core assets leading to lower prices prevailing in the market, thereby increasing the volume and the returns on loan portfolios available for us or the Fund Manager to purchase; (d) increase the requirements of third-party service clients for our services, enabling us to compete for and win asset servicing and management contracts on acceptable terms; (e) enhance the returns available for investments in non-performing and non-core assets, thereby making it more attractive for LP investors to commit capital under a discretionary mandate to be managed by our Fund Manager; or ----- (f) impact our ability or the cost of raising funds to support our Balance Sheet business. While on the one hand a deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business (as detailed above), such deteriorating macroeconomic conditions may, on the other hand, generate opportunities for our business. The current macroeconomic environment is dominated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe will increase transaction activity in late 2021 and beyond, which could in turn create new market opportunities for our business.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.4.2,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China, rapidly spreading to nearly all regions around the world, including the UK and Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Italy, which caused the World Health Organization to declare COVID19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In order to prevent the spread of the virus, governments around the world implemented several measures, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines and self-isolations for infected people, business slowdowns or shutdowns, and encouraging or requiring people to avoid large gatherings. For example, in response to the COVID19 pandemic, on March 23, 2020, the UK government imposed a nationwide quarantine together with several other measures. As a result of these restrictive measures across all the countries in which we operate, we closed substantially all of our offices and transitioned all of our employees to remote working. Whilst restrictions have eased at times – for example the nationwide quarantine in the UK was lifted on May 10, 2020 – significant restrictions and social distancing measures have remained in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall economies of the countries in which we operate and, in turn, our operations and our customers’ operations. For instance, court closures and various legal and regulatory measures intended to help debtors, such as moratoria on certain collection or enforcement activities, along with a slowdown in the real estate market, heavily impacted our ability to make collections during this period. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to prevent a further spread, our business was impacted globally in 2020 by the temporary closure and restrictions as a consequence of the guidelines given by the respective governments of the countries where we operate. Collections performance is a critical factor for our business and the COVID-19 pandemic led to disruptions in our cash collection performance, as a result of a deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, changes to our customers’ financial circumstances and lockdown measures implemented in the countries in which we operate, resulting in court closures and impacting the business’s ability to litigate and operate as normal. Our cash collections during the three months ended March 31, 2020 were £85.0 million, representing 92% of ERC with the only material shortfall relating to £10 million of delayed collections from two large secured assets in Italy and Ireland. However, we started to see the early signs of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during March 2020 and our collections performance weakened in April 2020 with secured collections, impacted by lockdown and court closures to 78% of ERC, enhanced by the acceleration of cash flows from the restructuring of one of the Group’s co-investment portfolios. During this period, unsecured collections stabilized at 74% of ERC. Excluding the collection acceleration, cash collections for April 2020 settled at 75% of ERC. ----- Approximately 34% of the Group’s ERC is derived from secured portfolios – primarily in Portugal and Italy – where cash collections are often driven either by the local court system or result from the completion of real estate sales. Whilst both of these collection strategies were directly impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions imposed by European governments, secured portfolios are backed by underlying assets and therefore, the timing of cash collections can be impacted, together with the quantum in the event of real estate price decreases. The majority of the remaining 66% of the Group’s ERC consists of unsecured assets – primarily in the UK, followed by Portugal and the Netherlands – where collections are driven by smaller, more frequent monthly cash collections. Automated collections form approximately 46% of total Group collections and approximately 87% of Northern European (the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands) unsecured collections. Where unsecured collections are not automated, they are substantially all paid by remote electronic means. Collections started to recover in May 2020 from the low in April, with secured collections at 62% of ERC and unsecured at 85% of ERC. Collections during the three months ended March 31, 2020 were £85.0 million, representing 92% of ERC, and during the six months ended June 30, 2020 were £175.7 million, representing 91% of ERC. Our financial response to the collections weakness was proactive and we strengthened our liquidity position in the first half of 2020 demonstrating our ability to manage liquidity, in particular through the curtailment of investments in new portfolio acquisitions and the suspension of shareholder dividends. Cash and cash equivalents improved by £77.0 million to £165.8 million from December 31, 2019 to June 30, 2020 with decisive action on cost and working capital as well as acceleration of collections to make up for COVID-19 induced collection weakness and reduced portfolio purchases of £42.9 million (six months ended June 30, 2019: £165.6 million). Furthermore, we raised additional funds in July 2020 through the execution of a €104.7 million asset backed amortizing loan and completed a long-term support agreement with our bank lenders at that time, recognizing that short term leverage would increase above previous covenant levels as the impact of lower collections built over the following twelve months. As a result of our cautious view on the macroeconomic environment at that time, we reforecast our ERC at June 30, 2020, resulting in a non-cash write down to portfolio investments on the balance sheet of £133.6 million and an operating loss of £108.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 (six months ended June 30, 2019: £59.0 million of operating profit). During the third quarter of 2020, we saw an improving cash collections trend. Whilst the easing of lockdown measures and the development of a vaccine have potentially lessened the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment, we remained cautious. Collections in the third quarter 2020 were £85.1 million representing 141% of the revised ERC, and were partially driven by a catch-up in secured collections from earlier in the year. The collections performance continued to be better than we predicted, with £78.1 million of collections in the fourth quarter of 2020. Collections for the full year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to £338.9 million (2019: £442.3 million), with collections during the six months ended December 31, 2020 representing 125% of revised ERC. Collections performance has continued to remain robust in 2021, with collections in the first quarter of 2021 of £76.9 million (first quarter of 2020: £85.0 million) representing 106% of ERC and in the second quarter of 2021 of £102.7 million (second quarter of 2020: £90.7 million) representing 131% of ERC. Collections during the six months ended June 30, 2021 were £179.6 million, representing 119% of December 2020 ERC. Overall, we have had a strong second quarter with our 2021 second quarter stand-alone results, with our ----- profit before tax being 1.9 times greater than our first quarter in 2021. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, we had a profit before tax and takeover costs of £22.9 million (loss of £135.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020), with £22.4 million of Acquisition costs recognized and, together with the strong collections performance, this had a beneficial impact on our leverage levels with our leverage for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 decreasing by 0.4 times from 5.1 times. While the impact to our business has been significant, the wider dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on borrowers has also been significant. Following the global financial crisis in 2008, NPLs in the European financial systems peaked at approximately €1.2 trillion. While NPLs had decreased to roughly half of that figure by the end of 2019, stress tests on banks by the ECB suggest that NPLs could reach a new peak at roughly €1.4 trillion as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented economic and social challenges. Whilst we have not yet experienced an increase in the willingness of Investment Portfolio Sellers to sell defaulted debt, we expect that during late 2021 and into 2022, market activity will increase, potentially leading to an increase in the volume of portfolios that we are able to acquire.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Our Existing Portfolios produced Cash Collections of £411.6 million in 2018, £442.3 million in 2019, £338.9 million in 2020 and £179.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021. The carrying value of our Existing Portfolios on our balance sheet was £1,028.0 million as of June 30, 2021, £1,042.2 million as of December 31, 2020, £1,163.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and £1,087.0 million as of December 31, 2018. The 84-month ERC of our Existing Portfolios on our balance sheet was £1,572.2 million as of June 30, 2021, £1,555.8 million as of December 31, 2020, £1,817.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and £1,634.8 million as of December 31, 2018. As of June 30, 2021, 66% of our 84-month ERC represented unsecured portfolios and 34% represented secured portfolios. As of June 30, 2021, 36%, 26%, 21%, 15% and 2% of our 84month ERC were originated in the UK, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands and Ireland, respectively. We acquire a broad range of portfolios, including, but not limited to, unsecured consumer loans, (such as defaulted or non-performing credit card or personal loan debt), secured consumer loans, (such as defaulted residential mortgage debt), defaulted commercial loans, (such as defaulted commercial mortgage debt and unsecured commercial loan in a bankruptcy where the recovery may be realization of business assets, cash in court, tax credits and real estate), and real estate, (such as residential or commercial properties). Central to maximizing the collections performance across this broad range of portfolios are our local platforms, which utilize local knowledge and expertise. For example, our Italian business, Europa Investimenti, acquires credit positions in commercial bankruptcies and uses its knowledge of the court system and granular and forensic analysis of individual companies to assess ----- opportunities. Europa Investimenti will identify an opportunity, such as an SME bankruptcy, and typically, an opportunity will be fully underwritten by the Europa Investimenti investment team, with underwriting assumptions verified by our central function. The purchase of the credit positions in relation to the bankruptcy enables Europa Investimenti to recover against the assets of the company. The assets may consist of cash in court, tax credits, unsecured debtor claims and/or real estate. Furthermore, Europa Investimenti will often seek to purchase all or a majority of the credits and seek to submit a Concordato proposal to the court. A Concordato is a specific Italian bankruptcy procedure that allows an independent third-party to arrange a proposal to pay off credits at a fixed rate in exchange for ownership of all assets of the bankruptcy. Proposals are typically made after the finalization of the bankruptcy creditor list to reduce risk of late claims. Any legal challenges against the court’s award of the Concordato are settled out of court, through purchase of challengers’ bankruptcy credits. The Concordato process is voted upon by the creditors and therefore, Europa Investimenti, as creditor, is in a position to accept the proposal, thereby accelerating the timing of collections. In some cases, the assets will be pre-sold generating a high Net Deal IRR. Europa Investimenti operate in very specific niche areas and utilize their knowledge of the bankrupt company and legal and court processes to maximize the collection and importantly, the timing of the collection. The operation of Europa Investimenti is therefore very different to some of our other platforms, such as Capquest in the UK. Capquest in the UK services unsecured consumer debt. Collections are typically small, regular, annuity-like payments collected over a long period of time, with a highly sophisticated data analytical and statistical approach to collections being employed. Using data analytics, we formulate the most efficient, effective and regulation-compliant collection strategy, which may involve litigation strategies. The amount a particular customer pays generally varies depending on the portion of such customer’s disposable income available to service defaulted debt. We generally pursue two broad types of collection activities: - Payment plans: most customers pay by entering into long-term repayment plans, which provides us significant cash flow visibility. - One-off payments: arise when a payment (less than the full amount) leads to the closure of the account and any remaining balance is written off. We make a settlement assumption on each portfolio when it is purchased, which has an impact on the purchase price. An important component of our cash collection strategies is ensuring that we operate in line with our values and achieve fair outcomes for customers in line with our regulatory responsibilities. Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customers, our forbearance and vulnerable customer policies and processes were important for our customers. For further details on our collections performance during 2020 and 2021, see “Significant Factors Affecting Results _of OperationsImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” For further details on our service platforms_ and collection strategies, see “Business.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.4.4,Portfolio investments,"Our performance is dependent on our ability to purchase investment portfolios since these portfolios drive revenue for our Balance Sheet business and enable us to generate management ----- and performance fees in our Fund and Investment Management business. Since the launch of Arrow Credit Opportunities, our investments have typically been made through a co-investment alongside the Fund by a 100% owned Jersey partnership, Arrow SMA, although we may continue to make direct investments as well, primarily for certain strategic reasons. The current coinvestment level is typically 25%, however for future funds it is our intention to reduce this level as we focus on growing our capital-light businesses. As such, the level of portfolio investments is likely to remain broadly flat or may reduce slightly in the coming years. As at December 31, 2018, the balance sheet carrying value of our portfolio investments was £1,087 million and during 2018, the value of portfolios acquired was £263.4 million. As at December 31, 2019, the balance sheet carrying value of our portfolio investments was £1,163.6 million and during 2019, the value of portfolios acquired in the year was £303.7 million. As at December 31, 2020, the balance sheet carrying value of our portfolio investments was £1,042.2 million and during 2020, the value of portfolios acquired in the year was £109.9 million. As at June 30, 2021, the balance sheet carrying value of our portfolio investments was £1,028.0 million and during the six months ended June 30, 2021, the value of portfolios acquired was £94.8 million (as compared to £42.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020). There are several factors that influence the level and price at which our Balance Sheet business and our Fund and Investment Management business acquire portfolios, with the supply and demand for portfolios influencing the price of such portfolios. The supply of portfolios is partly driven by the volume of debt/portfolios made available by debt originators in the primary markets, together with the level of secondary sales made primarily by closed-end funds. We also source portfolios through bankruptcy and other special situations. However, considering that our business model is characterized by a strong local presence and the ability to provide asset expertise on a granular level, we have been able to develop strong relationships with potential debt sellers/originators, thereby allowing us to maximize our profits and avoid, to the extent possible, acquiring portfolios through competitive auctions processes that often involve lower yields on portfolios. We believe that our increasing drive towards off-market acquisitions leads to better returns and during 2020, based on our calculations, 74% of our investment portfolios were acquired through off-market deals. We expect to continue to source the majority of our portfolios through such off-market strategy by leveraging our local presence and experienced local operators. As mentioned above, the supply and demand for portfolios influences the price, and therefore the return, available to us. The key metric used when assessing portfolios is Net Deal IRR. Actual Net Deal IRR achieved will vary depending upon our performance against forecast. Actual Net Deal IRR achieved is based on actual cash collections to date and the remaining ERC and, as at June 30, 2021, the average Net Deal IRR achieved of 17% on all vintages since 2010, represents 13% for on-market deals and 18% for off-market deals, highlighting the benefits of our origination strategy. For details of Net Deal IRR by vintage, see “Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our Business Model: Balance Sheet Business.”_ The market dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on borrowers has also been significant. Based upon the ECB’s stress tests on banks, we expect that NPLs could reach a new peak at approximately €1.4 trillion. As such, we expect that the supply of portfolios being offered by Investment Portfolio Sellers to increase and that this market dislocation will ----- generate significant opportunities going forward. Furthermore, we expect that during late 2021 and into 2022, market activity will increase, potentially leading to an increase in the volume of portfolios that we are able to acquire. Given the uncertainty since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted a more defensive and conservative investment strategy, investing in portfolios with typically shorter weighted average lives, including more granular assets and a higher proportion of secured assets. See “Business—Our Key Strengths—Highly cash flow generative with conservative risk _management and strong balance sheet.” Our conservative approach to the underwriting of ERC_ has led to an over-performance of our actual collections against ERC. When measured from the period from purchase to June 30, 2021, the actual cash collections represent 230% and 296% of the expected collections at the time of underwriting for the 2020 and 2021 vintage years, respectively. This in turn has created a significant upside in the Net Deal IRR for the 2020 vintage, increasing from 16% at underwriting to 21% as at June 30, 2021. The 2021 vintage has been underwritten at a similar Net Deal IRR of 16%, but given the over-performance on actual collections to date, we would anticipate that the expected Net Deal IRR will increase in due course. The ability to purchase debt portfolios through our Balance Sheet business is also dependent on our internally generated cash resources and our access to financing at the time loan portfolios become available for purchase. As we sought to preserve liquidity during 2020 in response to weakened collections as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we curtailed our investment in portfolios. However, we believe that with our access to third-party capital through our Fund and Investment Management business, we are well placed to continue to invest at scale, which drives numerous benefits including, but not limited to, ongoing development of origination capabilities by building on our trusted relationships with Investment Portfolio Sellers and increased access to performance data on customers and portfolios, leading to more accurate underwriting and operational leverage. This ability to scale operations, without the liquidity and leverage constraints that impact many competitor debt management businesses, is a significant competitive advantage and enables us to grow our earnings through capital-light revenues rather than the more capital-intensive Balance Sheet business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Our total operating expenses comprise two elements, being Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs, which encompass the direct costs of operations, and secondly, other operating expenses, which encompass the indirect costs of our operations. The most significant direct and indirect costs relate to staff costs with respect to our approximately 2,500 full time equivalent employees. By way of illustration, our total staff costs for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were £53.9 million which amounted to 48% of our total costs (excluding costs associated with the Acquisition) for that period. We closely monitor costs incurred through a number of activities. Our annual budget process requires all cost center owners to agree the costs, both direct and indirect, for their area of responsibility. Any overspending against budgets are reviewed on a monthly basis. Furthermore, ----- we utilize a number of metrics, such as EBITDA Margin and collection costs as a percentage of Cash Collections, to highlight areas of inefficiency and seek to take action accordingly. In addition, our central procurement function ensures a consistent approach to third-party supplier management, through our policy that aims to ensure that: - risks associated with the contracting of third-party suppliers and partners for the provision of business functions or services are understood; - management of third-party supplier and partner relationships reflect the risks associated with the services being provided; - there are clear expectations and requirements for the management of third-party supplier relationships before, during and after the contractual period of the supplier relationship; - roles and responsibilities for managing third party supplier relationships are clearly defined; and - the best possible commercial agreement is in place with all third-party suppliers. Our procurement function assists the business in obtaining quotes and undertaking tenders for contracts over specified limits, together with ensuring that any costs are approved prior to being incurred with appropriate approval limits dependent upon the quantum of the costs to be incurred. In addition, our centralized Human Resources (“HR”) function seeks to ensure standardized processes, provide control around recruitment and implement training to ensure that we maximize our talent. This ensures the alignment of our bonus schemes and enables pay comparison between our different platforms and businesses. Going forward, we expect to align our platforms vertically under a fund management framework with greater accountability of our local operations. We expect that empowering our local champion platforms with increased local accountability will engender a cost-ownership culture where our operations in different jurisdictions will assume control and responsibility for reducing costs incurred by that particular jurisdictional operation, as well as avoiding dual-layer costs from the Group management structures. We believe that this, together with the expected cost savings related to the transfer of the Target from public to private ownership, will deliver greater operational efficiencies and cost reductions.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.4.7,Revenues from our Fund and Investment Management operations,"Revenues from our Fund and Investment Management operations are largely comprised of management fees and performance fees, which as detailed under “Our business model: Our _Structure,” accrue directly or indirectly to the Restricted Group. LP investors in the Fund, and any_ future funds, will pay ACML, the Fund Manager, management fees predominantly based on the net asset value of funds managed, with a small amount paid on committed capital. In addition, LP investors incentivize the Fund Manager through performance fees. See “Business—Our _businesses—Fund and Investment Management business.”_ Performance-related fees are recognized only where it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed in the future. This is generally near the end of the performance period or upon early liquidation of a fund. Performance-related fees will only be crystallized when a performance “hurdle” is met. The Fund has a hurdle rate of 7% - 8% Net Deal IRR, after which the Fund Manager is entitled to broadly 20% of the returns above that level, with the Group being entitled to 40% of these fees. Therefore, earning of performance fees is largely driven by our ability to exceed the performance hurdle, including the Net Deal IRR for the relevant fund. For accounting recognition purposes, the estimate of performance fees is made with reference to the liquidation profile for the specific fund, which factors in portfolio exits and timeframes, and a constraint is applied to the estimate to reflect uncertainty of future fund performance. Since performance fees are predominantly generated on the net asset value, future revenues from our Fund and Investment Management business will depend on our ability to invest the ----- committed capital from the Fund and also attract LP investors for new funds. As of June 30, 2021, 54% of the Fund had been deployed or committed, including both third party investments and our co-investments (64% of the Fund had been deployed excluding our co-investment) and we expect to commence the fund raising for our second fund, ACO 2, in early 2022, when the capital deployed, after recycling collections, within the Fund is approximately 70% of the total capital commitments (provided that the deployment rate remains consistent with historical rates of deployment). Our ability to attract new LP investors into our second fund will partly be dependent upon the success of the Fund and the fund raising climate. Our revenues from the Fund and Investment Management business will also depend on the terms that we are willing to offer to LP investors and the terms we are able to negotiate with them, including hurdle rates and the level of management fees. Due to the co-invest model, revenues from our Balance Sheet business and Asset Management and Servicing business will also be driven to some extent by the future growth of our Fund and Investment Management business because our Balance Sheet business can co-invest into the new assets managed by our Fund and Investment Management business, which can then be serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing business. Given our transition to the integrated asset manager model and the development of the Fund and Investment Management business, the Group’s segmental results for the year ended December 31, 2020, together with comparatives for the year ended December 31, 2019, have been presented for our three businesses, being the Fund and Investment Management, Asset Management and Servicing and Balance Sheet businesses. In earlier periods, the segmental results were presented for two divisions only, being the investment business and asset management and servicing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.4.8,Profitability from our Asset Management and Servicing business,"Revenue from our Asset Management and Servicing business relates to income from a broad range of services that are offered by the Arrow platforms in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization, legal title holding, due diligence activities, initial platform migration and on-boarding activities, securitization vehicle set-up and ongoing management activities, new origination activities, litigation and court process management and third-party sub-servicer management. The ability to increase revenue is driven by our ability to retain existing clients, win new contracts and service a greater percentage of the portfolios acquired by the Fund. During 2020, we won 26 new third-party contracts, a record number in any financial year, and during the first half of 2021, we won a further 11 contracts. Furthermore, on August 17, 2021, we announced plans to acquire the collections and recoveries operations within Tesco Bank’s Customer Service division. This partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced service to customers in financial difficulty by providing the necessary support and flexibility they will need in the future. Tesco Bank chose to partner with us, given our customer focus, proven expertise, technology platform and the cultural alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The partnership is expected to result in over 200 Tesco Bank personnel being transferred to us on November 1, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased demand for our services, as ----- banks and other debt providers have seen an increase in arrears and require additional resources and expertise in managing late stage arrears and defaulted customers. In addition to the external clients serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing business, the business also services portfolios acquired by the Fund and our Balance Sheet business. The increased scale of our FUM represents an important source of new contracts. As of June 30, 2021, 71% of the portfolios acquired by the Fund were being serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing business. In addition to the ability to increase revenues, it is equally important to control costs and, through increased operational leverage as the platforms grow, the conversion of the Target from a public to private company, the vertical alignment of our platforms under a fund management framework with greater local accountability, we will seek to ensure that both new and existing businesses achieve our stated target EBITDA Margin of 25%. A failure to grow revenue, with our stated target being 10% CAGR per annum for each year until 2025, and to achieve our EBITDA Margin will result in lower profit than anticipated within our Asset Management and Servicing business. There can be no assurance that we will achieve such targets within the targeted time frames or at all.

We continue to invest in our IT infrastructure to ensure that it meets our objectives of flexibility, control, resilience and cost effectiveness. The COVID-19 pandemic presented, in real time and on a scale and timescale that could not have been forecast, ----- the opportunity to test the resilience of our systems and our response was swift and successful. See “Business—ESG.” During 2020, we incurred £13.8 million in capital expenditure, being £11.4 million of intangible assets, predominantly relating to IT and software license costs, and £2.5 million of fixed assets, predominantly relating to leased assets. During 2019, we incurred £13.1 million in capital expenditure, being £11.8 million of intangible assets and £1.3 million of fixed assets. We expect our capital expenditure to remain broadly stable in 2021 compared to our historical capital expenditures in 2020 and 2019. As we continue to grow our business, particularly through our new Fund and Investment Management business, we expect that additional costs may be incurred, such as in the development of our new funds system, but we expect that the significant portion of such costs to be re-charged through designated charges to the Fund.

We review our ERC on a biannual basis to ensure that the expected Cash Collections continue to be aligned with our expectations and such review may result in an increase or decrease in our ERC. Any change in the ERC will result in an impairment / fair value gain, where the ERC increases, or a loss, where the ERC decreases. See “ManagementOperational Committees.” In addition, the timing of collections can be uneven during any financial year. As we purchase a broad range of portfolios, some of which may comprise a portion or entirety of real estate assets, the collection on such portfolios may be realized only when the asset is sold. In some circumstances, the collection will be maximized by incurring capital expenditure before sale and therefore the time to realize collections can be uncertain. Furthermore, certain portfolios may have an uneven collections profile. For example, we have acquired a portfolio, which represents a minority interest in a lending business in the Netherlands, where the final collection represents the disposal of the underlying business and, as such, generates an uneven cash flow profile. See “Risk _FactorsOther Risks Relating to our OperationsUneven portfolio supply patterns may prevent us from pursuing all of the purchase opportunities we would like to, and may result in us experiencing uneven cash flows and financial results.”_ Furthermore, purchases of investment portfolios by our Balance Sheet business and by our Fund and Investment Management business are likely to be uneven during a financial year due to fluctuating supply and demand within the market, with a corresponding impact on leverage and earnings. We typically purchase more loan portfolios in terms of purchase price in the fourth quarter (when Investment Portfolio Sellers (financial institutions in particular) aim to sell assets before their year-end) compared to each of the first three quarters. However, we aim to purchase a particular amount of loan portfolios annually and, during some financial years, we may purchase a higher or lower proportion of our targeted purchases earlier in the year. See “Risk ----- _FactorsOther Risks Relating to our OperationsUneven portfolio supply patterns may prevent us from pursuing all of the purchase opportunities we would like to, and may result in us experiencing uneven cash flows and financial results.”_ As a result of one or all of the factors noted above, the results and performance of our businesses may fluctuate due to such seasonal matters and may differ from our expectations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The development of our integrated asset manager model is important to the successful execution of our strategy and our performance. Our three businesses are complementary to one another. The Balance Sheet business coinvests alongside the Fund, typically at 25%, in new portfolio investments managed by our Fund and Investment Management business, with approximately 71% of the portfolio investments being serviced by our Arrow platforms within our Asset Management and Servicing business. See “— _Our Business Model.”_ In addition, there are intangible benefits, with the building of intellectual property from the investment at scale that this integrated model drives. We believe that being able to invest at scale allows us to build origination capability through broadening and deepening relationships with Investment Portfolio Sellers and extending our reach to source off-market deals. In turn, the increased level of portfolios purchased enriches and builds our data and data analytical capabilities, leading to increased accuracy of underwriting and pricing portfolios. The increased scale is an enabler to create operational leverage within our platforms in our Asset Management and Servicing business, allowing returns to be maximized. Strong returns build our capital-light earnings, enable deleveraging and increase the appetite from LP investors to commit financing to our future funds, enabling the growth of our Fund Manager with the ability to further grow and increase the scale of our businesses. The above changes to our business model and strategy have had and will continue to have an impact on the results of our operations, and as such, the results of operations and cash flows for ----- future periods may not be comparable.

These assets and liabilities must be recognized at fair value at the date of the Acquisition. This will affect the comparability of our future consolidated financial statements with the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. We will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to our financial statements. The application of purchase accounting will result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill write-off, software, and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made. Furthermore, we will incur additional indebtedness and corresponding interest expense as a result of the Transactions, which is expected to amount to approximately £85 million in aggregate. As of June 30, 2021, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had total indebtedness in the aggregate amount of £1,354 million, primarily consisting of the Notes and the Revolving Facility. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.” Our indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business opportunities, since a substantial portion our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness, and this may place us at a competitive disadvantage as some of our competitors are less leveraged.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum.

The output of this review may lead to changes within the business, such as organizational changes, that may lead to a change in our reporting, for example to our segmental reporting and/or key ----- performance metrics. Furthermore, there may be changes to our cost base, for example arising from the change from a public to private company. In particular, as we have grown into new markets and built out our servicing capability, we have invested in centralized functions as part of the One Arrow programme, which sought horizontal alignment of the business. As such, since the IPO in 2013, pre-exceptional cost income ratio has moved from less than 50% to over 65%. Going forward, we believe there are areas of centralization to retain, but that other functions are better and more efficiently delivered with local accountability. We therefore expect an outcome of the strategic review will be to switch to a more vertically aligned model with local champion platforms and corresponding local investment strategies. We expect to maintain central origination and underwriting functions, supported by local expertise. However, we expect to empower our local champion platforms with local accountability and adopt a fund manager framework for the management of the local platforms. We believe our focus on creating a cost-ownership culture will deliver efficiencies without creating dual-layer costs and will lead to greater accountability.

As such, Net Deal IRR is a key metric in assessing the returns that will ultimately be generated for LP investors and also for Arrow SMA, driving the revenues of our Balance Sheet business. Net Deal IRR represents the return, based on gross collections after direct collection costs (including any margin for the servicer). Net Deal IRR is calculated using the actual collections to date and the ERC, which together represent the entire actual and expected future Cash Collections on an investment portfolio. For the 2020 vintage, the Net Deal IRR, as at June 30, 2021, was 21%. See “Our Business ModelOur business model: Balance Sheet business.” The level of portfolio purchases by us, which have predominantly been made by Arrow SMA since the beginning of January 2020 when the Fund commenced deployment, is important, along with Net Deal IRR, to drive the revenue of our Balance Sheet business.

The Group’s co-investment alongside the Fund and Investment Management business is deemed to be held in a different ‘business model’ other than ‘hold to collect,’ as these portfolio investments are managed primarily on a fair value basis, with reporting to senior management on the performance of these assets being prepared on that basis, and key management remuneration being linked to the performance of such assets on a fair value basis. As such, the ‘business model’ of these portfolios is neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell the Portfolio Assets. As such, our co-investment alongside the Fund and other co-investment portfolios purchased alongside other third-parties are classified as fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”). As part of our investment activities, we sometimes acquire real estate positions as part of a transaction. Where such real estate is acquired for the purposes of immediate resale, or where a sale will immediately follow a period of time where capital expenditure is being applied to the asset, such investments fall under the scope of IAS 2 – Inventories. In line with IAS 2, all assets classified as inventories are held at initial cost, plus any subsequent cost of capital expenditure. Such assets are held at the lower of cost and net realizable value, but apart from this, no gain or loss will be taken on the value of the assets until the point at which they are sold, or partially sold. Initially, investment portfolios – amortized cost are held at the purchase price less any transaction fees. The effective interest rate (“EIR”) for the portfolio is calculated using the 84month ERC at underwriting. Revenue is calculated using the EIR method. On a biannual basis at June and December each year, we update the 84-month ERC and the output is reviewed by the PRC (chaired by the Group CEO), who consider any indicators of increases or decreases to our ERC. Where loan portfolios exhibit objective evidence of impairment, typically as the actual collections during the period and remaining 84-month ERC is less than the 84-month ERC at the start of the period, and an impairment loss is required to be recognized and we record an adjustment to the carrying value of the loan portfolio. If the forecast loan portfolio collections exceed initial estimates, typically as the actual collections during the period and remaining 84-month ERC is greater than the 84-month ERC at the start of the period, we record an adjustment to increase the carrying value of the loan portfolio. In accordance with IAS 39, we recognize any change in carrying value in the statement of profit or loss. See “—Key accounting policies, judgements and _assumptions and estimates—Key Accounting Policies.”_ For investment portfolios – FVTPL, the process is similar with a few notable exceptions. Firstly, the initial costs of the acquisition, such as due diligence costs, are written-off to the profit and loss statement as incurred. Second, the EIR is calculated using the lifetime ERC rather than the 84-month ERC and whilst the EIR for an amortized cost portfolio will remain the same throughout the life of the transaction, under FVTPL, the EIR is adjusted for changes in market rates.

The EIR is defined as the portfolio’s IRR based on the portfolio purchase price and forecast 84-Month ERC as of the date of purchase for portfolios held at amortized cost. The calculation of the EIR includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, such as legal and due diligence fees. ----- We reassess and adjust the EIR up to twelve months after the purchase of each loan portfolio to reflect refinements made to our estimates of future cash flows based on enhanced data and analysis considered during that time period. This adjustment has historically not resulted in any material impact on income from portfolio investments. Income from portfolio investments at amortized cost is then calculated by multiplying the carrying value of each loan portfolio as of the beginning of the period by the EIR. _Fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL_ For the portfolios held at an amortized cost, the total returns from the portfolio include the interest income, reported through Income from portfolio investments at amortized cost, together with changes arising from Cash Collections being different from the ERC and also from changes to our ERC, which are reported through the impairment gains/(losses) on portfolio investments. For portfolios held at FVTPL, the fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL represents all of the income and expenses relating to our portfolio investments which are classified as FVTPL. The line item includes fair value changes, interest and dividends. As such, the fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL on a portfolio will represent the change in the carrying value of the portfolio, together with the actual Cash Collections on the portfolio. The carrying value is assessed based on the ERC at the period-end, discounted at the EIR. The EIR is calculated using the lifetime ERC, rather than an 84-month ERC for amortized cost portfolios, and the EIR will vary during the life of the portfolio due to changes in the risk free rate or other market movements. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of portfolios, such as legal and due diligence fees, for portfolios held at FVTPL are expensed directly to the statement of income and expenditure as incurred. This is different from the treatment for a similar portfolio held at amortized cost. _Impairment (losses)/gains on portfolio investments_ As noted above, an important component in the accounting for both portfolio investments held at amortized cost and at FVTPL, is our assessment of the ERC. See _“—Key accounting _policies, judgements and assumptions and estimates—Key Accounting Assumptions and Estimates—Carrying value of portfolio investments.”_ We reassess our ERC at least every six months utilizing both the local knowledge from the servicer and the broader macro factors. Following the re-assessment of our ERC, we re-calculate the carrying value of the portfolio using the EIR, which for portfolios held at amortized cost does not change after the initial period up to the twelve-month period. Any change in the carrying value of such portfolios is reported as an Impairment gains/(losses) on portfolio investments. In assessing the carrying value of Portfolios held at amortized cost, we will continue to use the 84-month ERC and as such, absent any other changes, the carrying value will increase from one period to the next as forecast collections in month 85 are included within the calculation. Such expected collections are discounted using the EIR to calculate the change in value of the carrying ----- value. Since several of our portfolios, particularly our unsecured portfolios, have long annuity type collection profiles, such future collections are not included within our 84-month ERC. _Income from real estate inventories_ As part of our investment activities, we sometimes acquire real estate positions as part of a transaction. Where such real estate is acquired for the purposes of immediate resale, or where a sale will immediately follow a period of time where capital expenditure is being applied to the asset, such investments fall under the scope of IAS 2 – Inventories. In line with IAS 2, income is recognized at the time of disposal of the real estate and is measured as a gain or loss on the transaction, based on the sale proceeds, after any selling costs, less the cost of acquisition, after any acquisitions fees and costs, and less the costs of any capital expenditure incurred. _Income from asset management and servicing and fund and investment management_ Income from our Asset Management and Servicing business and our Fund and Investment Management business, i.e., our capital-light businesses, are predominantly reported as Income from asset management and servicing and fund and investment management. Income from asset management and servicing contracts with clients is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a client. We recognize revenue when the Asset Management and Servicing business satisfies a performance obligation related to a service it has undertaken to provide to a client. Servicing income makes up the majority of the asset management and servicing income, and in itself comprises a broad range of services, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization, legal title holding, data analytical forecasting, due diligence activities, forensic valuations, initial platform migration and onboarding activities, securitization vehicle set-up and ongoing management activities, new origination activities, litigation and court process management and third-party sub-servicer management. In all material cases, the services are provided at a point in time that corresponds to the satisfaction of the related performance obligations. As such, revenue arising from servicing income is normally recognized as the services are provided to the client, with no deferral or acceleration of revenue across the life of the contract. Fund and investment management income encompasses services provided in relation to the discretionary and semi-discretionary allocation and management of third-party capital. Fees for fund and investment management services are normally calculated based on a fixed percentage of the value of assets managed and deducted from the client’s account balance on a regular basis. Income from fund and investment management services is recognized over time as the services are provided. Performance-related fees are recognized only where it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed in the future. This is generally near the end of the performance period or upon early liquidation of a fund. Performance-related fees will only be crystallized when a performance hurdle is met. The estimate of performance fees is made with reference to the liquidation profile for the Fund, which factors in portfolio exits and timeframes. A constraint is applied to the estimate to reflect uncertainty of future fund performance. To date, no performance fees on the Fund have been recognized. ----- In some instances, fees may be paid to a third party which are directly linked to the acquisition of a long-term contract with a client. In line with IFRS 15 requirements, such costs are included on the balance sheet as a cost to acquire a client contract, and are released to the comprehensive statement of profit or loss over time, on a profile corresponding with the period over which economic benefits will be derived from the contract. As at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had assets relating to contracts with clients in the amount of £8.8 million and £3.1 million, respectively. These assets fully relate to up-front costs which were incurred to acquire clients within our Fund and Investment Management business, and will be released to the comprehensive statement of profit and loss across the same period as the associated income will be recognized, which is the lifetime of the related fund. A key judgement made in recognizing these costs which were incurred to acquire clients was whether or not the investors in the Fund met the definition of a “customer” in accordance with IFRS 15. Given the relatively small number of typically larger, institutional investors with which we engage on an individual basis as part of the client acquisition process, this was deemed to meet the definition of a “customer” under IFRS 15 guidance. As at December 31, 2020, the weighted average life remaining on these contract balances was 7 years and 9 months. The contract balances amortized in the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in a £0.7 million of amortization expensed to the comprehensive statement of profit and loss in 2020 with no expense in prior periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The primary driver for this lower tax charge is the restatement of the UK deferred tax asset to reflect the enactment of Finance Act 2021, which increases the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% effective from April 1, 2023. At the March 2021 United Kingdom budget, the UK government announced an increase to the rate of UK corporation tax for the year, commencing April 1, 2023, and setting the rate at 25% which rate was approved with the passing into law of the Finance Act 2021 on June 10, 2021. The 10% effective tax rate primarily reflects the impact of a £3.7 million credit to reflect the restatement of the UK deferred tax asset, representing UK tax losses, as a result of the Finance Act 2021. Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the end of each period in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes). The value of recognized deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that based on available evidence, both positive and negative, sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow the asset to be recovered. If it is probable that some portion of these assets will not be realized, then no asset is recognized in relation to that portion. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2020, we had a deferred tax asset of £27.7 million relating to losses, including £98.2 million of UK tax losses, which are held on the balance sheet as a deferred tax asset of £18.7 million, due to the losses arising from the non-cash impairment arising in the year ended December 31, 2020. Of the remaining £9.0 million deferred tax asset relating to losses, the majority relate to £27.3 million of tax losses in the Netherlands, due to the difference in the recognition of accounting profits and taxable profits within the Netherlands. The recent tax changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate are as follows: (a) The Finance (No.2) Act 2015, as amended by the Finance Act 2016, included provisions to reduce the rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from April 1, 2020. The UK Government enacted legislation for the rate to remain at 19%. At the March 2021 United Kingdom budget, the UK government announced an increase to the rate of UK corporation tax for the year, commencing April 1, 2023, ----- and setting the rate at 25% which rate was approved with the passing into law of the Finance Act 2021 on June 10, 2021. (b) In December 2019, a new corporate tax law was enacted in the Netherlands. Consequently, as of January 1, 2020, the corporate tax rate in the Netherlands was reduced from 25% to 21.7%. This change resulted in a gain of £1,147,000 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of our Dutch subsidiaries being recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019. In September 2020, the Dutch Government announced the reversal of this planned decrease, maintaining the rate at 25%. A credit of £1,147,000 has been reflected in the year ended December 31, 2020, which reverses the prior year restatement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

This decrease was principally due to the fact that collections exceeded income (together with any impairment gains or losses) and the re-investment in portfolios. Cash collections in the first half of 2021 were £179.6 million (six months ended June 30, 2020: £175.7 million), reflecting our continued robust operational performance and the execution of a range of active portfolio management actions, despite the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unsecured collections from our UK business benefited from the recommencement of litigation collections strategies, with an acceleration of activity in during the fourth quarter of 2020 supporting strong performance throughout the first half of 2021. Elsewhere in Europe our unsecured collections remained robust and generally the performance of this asset class underlines the strength of our underwriting processes.

This increase was primarily due to the non-recurrence of the non-cash impairment charge of £120.8 million in income during the six months ended June 30, 2020 relating to the write-down of the ERC balance sheet asset. See “—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” For the six month period ended June 30, 2021, there was a net impairment gain of £17.7 million on the investment portfolios held at amortized cost. _Income from Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses_ Income from Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses increased by £10.1 million, or 22%, from £45.5 million as of June 30, 2020 to £55.6 million as of June 30, 2021. This increase was due to both the increase in management fees within the Fund and Investment Management business and the increase in servicing revenue within our Asset Management and Servicing business. Our Fund and Investment Management business generated third-party management fee income of £10.8 million in the first half of 2021 (six months ended June 30, 2020: £5.6 million) reflecting the strong level of capital deployment in the Fund. The second quarter of 2021 saw the highest rate of fund deployment to date, and, according to our assessments, we believe that we are on track to begin fundraising for our second fund in early 2022. FUM were €4.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 (December 31, 2020: €4.3 billion), including the Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing business subsidiaries of Norfin, Europa Investimenti and Sagitta. The increase in FUM was driven primarily by Norfin and Sagitta. The Asset Management and Servicing business continues to benefit from the servicing opportunities arising from the deployment of the Fund. Asset management and Servicing income from third-parties increased by 12.6% to £44.8 million (six months ended June 30, 2020: £39.8 million), reflecting the 37 new third-party contracts won between the start of 2020 and June 30, 2021. Third-party demand for our asset servicing capability remains high as the volume of European NPL assets grow, with 11 new contracts won in the first half of 2021, following on from the record 26 contract wins during 2020. ----- _Operating expenses_ Operating expenses increased by £23.3 million, or 21%, from £112.3 million as of June 30, 2020 to £135.6 million as of June 30, 2021. Given that certain operating expenses relating to the Acquisition were incurred during the relevant period that would otherwise not have been incurred in the reporting period (including the professional advisor fees incurred and because certain share-based payments and retention arrangements for key personnel below the executive director level were accelerated), accounts for £22.4 million of the aforementioned £23.3 million increase in operating expenses. Total operating expenses before the Acquisition-related costs increased slightly to £113.2 million (six months ended June 30, 2020: £112.3 million). This increase was principally due to the combined effects of the following: _Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs. Collection Activity and Fund_ Management Costs increased by £2.1 million, or 3%, from £64.3 million as of June 30, 2020 to £66.4 million as of June 30, 2021. While there was a reduction in Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs during the relevant period, this was offset by an increase in litigation costs and fund management costs, with the latter being driven by the build out of the Fund and Investment Management business, including a number of strategic hires in 2021, the creation of new teams and the build out of functions, as well as other costs associated with the strategic pivot to the asset manager model. _Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses (excluding £22.4 million of costs_ related to the Acquisition) decreased by £2.1 million, or 43%, from £48.0 million as of June 30, 2020 to £46.8 million as of June 30, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to strong cost control, which was largely offset the accrual for increased bonus payments during the six months ended June 30, 2021. _Finance costs_ Net finance costs increased slightly by £3.2 million, or 12%, from £27 million as of June 30, 2020 to £30.2 million as of June 30, 2021. This increase was in line with expectations and reflected the successful tap offering of the 2026 Notes completed during the first quarter of 2021. _Taxation credit/(charge) on ordinary activities_ Taxation on ordinary activities decreased from a taxation credit of £25.5 million as of June 30, 2020 to a taxation charge of £1.4 million as of June 30, 2021. This primarily reflects the losses arising during the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to the non-cash impairment charge of £120.8 million, compared with the profit before taxation during the six months ended June 30, 2021. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was 10.0%, compared to 18.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The low effective tax rate primarily reflects the credit of £3.7 million due to the restatement of the UK deferred tax asset, arising from the losses incurred in 2020. Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the tax losses and temporary timing differences are expected to reverse. At the March 2021 United Kingdom budget, the UK government announced an increase to the rate of ----- UK corporation tax for the year, commencing April 1, 2023, and setting the rate at 25% which rate was approved with the passing into law of the Finance Act 2021 on June 10, 2021. _Profit/(loss) after tax_ As a result of the foregoing factors, loss after tax decreased by £109.6 million, or 99%, from £110.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to £0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Without adjusting for takeover costs related to the Acquisition, profit before taxation for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was £22.9 million, with an associated taxation of £2.3 million. As such, without adjusting for takeover costs related to the Acquisition, profit after taxation for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was £20.6 million.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

This decrease was principally due to lower collections and lower investments in new portfolio acquisitions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Impact _of the COVID-19 pandemic.” As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we proactively managed_ cash in the first half of 2020 and took decisive action to reduce the level of investments. We experienced a slowdown in the market, predominantly driven by financial institutions taking a prudent approach to valuations and banks focusing on initial provisioning over asset sales during the first half of 2020. Full-year purchases for 2020 were £109.9 million (2019: £303.7 million), partly due to the impact of COVID-19 impact as well as our new investment model. In 2020, our balance sheet was typically invested alongside the Fund, with our participation in the Fund being at 25%. In 2020, balance sheet cash collections from our portfolio asset base were £338.9 million (2019: £442.3 million), with the decrease primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as government imposed lock-downs and customer uncertainty reduced collections performance. As a result of the uncertainty, we revalued the ERC balance sheet asset as of June 30, 2020 resulting in a non-cash impairment of portfolio investments in the amount of £133.6 million, subsequently reducing to £95.5 million as of December 31, 2020. Cash collections performed well against revised estimates in the second half of 2020, outperforming by approximately 25%.

This decrease was principally due to the non-cash impairment as noted above, together with the lower revenue from lower investments. _Income from Asset Management and Fund and Investment Management businesses_ Income from Asset Management and Fund and Investment Management businesses increased £2.6 million, or 2.8%, from £94.4 million in 2019 to £97.0 million in 2020. This increase, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrates the resilience of the income from our capital-light businesses. The £2.6 million increase was principally due to the increased revenue generated by our Asset Management and Servicing business that, throughout 2020, secured a record 26 new contract wins, driven by demand for us as a servicing partner for financial institutions that require additional collections capacity given the growth of NPL volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the launch of the Fund in late 2019 meant that we started to generate additional management fees within our Fund and Investment Management business. _Total operating expenses_ Operating expenses decreased £8.9 million, or 3.8%, from £233.7 million in 2019 to £224.8 million in 2020. This decrease was principally due to the combined effects of the following: _Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs. Collection Activity and Fund_ Management Costs decreased £0.9 million, or 0.7%, from £131.5 million in 2019 to £130.6 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to reduced litigation activity, which was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with legal disbursements reducing from £14.4 million in 2019 to £8.9 million in 2020, partially offset by higher direct operating costs, primarily from our investment in the Fund and Investment Management business following the launch of the Fund in late 2019. Since a portion of our collections activity is outsourced to third-parties, weaker collections performance will result in a reduction in the costs payable. _Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased £8.0 million, or 7.8%, from_ £102.2 million in 2019 to £94.2 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to strict cost control as we sought to mitigate the impact of weaker collections and the non-impairment write ----- down of the ERC. For a period during 2020, we cancelled all non-essential operating and capital expenditure whilst we evaluated the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. _Finance costs_ Net finance costs increased £3.0 million, or 5.5%, from £54.6 million in 2019 to £57.6 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to our raising the Euro Non-Recourse Facility to strengthen the balance sheet and provide additional financing during the COVID-19 pandemic. _Taxation credit/(charge) on ordinary activities_ Taxation on ordinary activities decreased from a taxation charge of £14.0 million in 2019 to a taxation credit of £21.2 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to losses incurred during the year as a result of the non-cash impairment. We recognized a deferred tax asset in relation to losses of £27.7 million (2019: £6.4 million), of which £18.7 million (2019: £nil) relate to the UK. The effective tax rate 18.5% in 2020, compared to a rate of 27.3% in 2019. The difference primarily relates to the impact of the non-cash impairment, which was predominantly incurred in the UK which has a lower standard corporation taxation rate than the other jurisdictions in which we operate. _Profit after tax_ As a result of the foregoing factors, profit after tax decreased from a profit of £37.3 million for 2019 to a loss of £93.6 million for 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

This increase was principally due to the high levels of investments made. Throughout 2019, the pricing environment and quantum of opportunities within our markets remained attractive and we committed to investing a record £303.7 million in new portfolios, with £62.9 million of this payment deferred to 2020 (2018: £263.4 million purchased, with £12.0 million deferred). Cash collections during 2019 from our purchased portfolio asset base increased to £442.3 million (2018: £411.6 million), reflecting continued strong operational performance. As of December 31, 2019, we had cumulatively collected 104% of our initial underwriting expectation on all portfolios, consistent with the position as of December 31, 2018. We purchased an increasing proportion of secured assets, including real estate assets. Whilst cash collections from unsecured assets, our original asset class, tend to be recognized on a more consistent basis quarter to quarter, the increasing cash collections from secured assets, where cash collections are more frequently realized at one point in time, rather than collected gradually over time, was resulting in greater quarterly variability of cash collections.

This decrease was principally due to a significant reduction in upwards revaluations of portfolios held on the balance sheet. Revaluations in 2018 were positively impacted from specific litigation work that was undertaken on the back book to drive cash collections from unpaying accounts. Lower levels of revaluations led to a 75.0% reduction in noncash impairment gains to £12.7 million (2018: £50.7 million). _Income from Asset Management and Servicing business_ Income from Asset Management and Servicing business increased £2.7 million, or 2.9%, from £91.7 million in 2018 to £94.4 million in 2019. This increase was principally due to the ongoing growth of our Asset Management and Servicing business as we sought to increase our capital-light revenues. During 2019, we continued our strategy of co-investing alongside other investors with the aim of servicing the entire portfolio. _Total operating expenses_ Operating expenses decreased £21.3 million, or 8.4%, from £255.0 million in 2018 to £233.7 million in 2019. The reporting split of total operating expenses was changed from 2019 to 2020, with a reclassification between ‘collection activity and fund management costs’ and ‘other operating expenses,’ as part of the change in the segmental reporting structure aligned to the integrated asset management model. The total operating expenses impact was nil, with the main movement between the categorizations relating to allocation of internal staff costs and professional ----- fees. The decrease in our operating expenses was principally due to the combined effects of the following: _Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs. Collection Activity and Fund_ Management Costs increased £4.9 million, or 4.1%, from £119.0 million in 2018 to £123.9 million prior to restatement in 2019 (£131.5 million post-restatement). The Collection Activity and Fund Management Cost ratio improved by 4.1 percentage points to 24.8% (2018: 28.9%) as we continued to extract efficiencies within our Asset Management and Servicing business and reduced the number of lower margin servicing contracts. _Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased £12.1 million, or 8.9%,_ from £136.0 million in 2018 to £123.9 million prior to restatement in 2019 (£102.2 million postrestatement). This decrease was primarily driven by the release of provisions held against the payment of deferred consideration against previous business acquisitions. This collectively totaled £21.7 million and was also driven by the realignment of remuneration for management teams in accordance with our strategy of growing our capital-light businesses. _Finance costs_ Net finance costs decreased £12.3 million, or 18.4%, from £66.8 million in 2018 to £54.5 million in 2019. This decrease was due to the non-recurrence of exceptional bond costs incurred in 2018. In 2018, bond refinancing costs comprised £18.7 million incurred on the early redemption of the €230 million floating rate senior secured notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), of which £13.6 million was a cash cost related to the redemption premium. The remaining £5.0 million was related to a non-cash write-off of transaction fees, incurred in connection with the 2023 Notes. Underlying net interest charges of £54.5 million increased by £6.3 million or 13.1% on the £48.2 million amount incurred during 2018 as a function of the unwind of the discount rate on deferred consideration, higher facility balances in the period and the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 lease accounting. _Taxation credit/(charge) on ordinary activities_ Taxation charge on ordinary activities increased £4.0 million, or 40%, from £10.0 million in 2018 to £14.0 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to the increase in profit before taxation by 28.3%, together with the increase in the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2019 was 27.3%, compared to 25.1% as in 2018, primarily reflecting the increase in profits generated in the territories in which we operate (other than the UK) where the standard corporation taxation rate is higher than in the UK. _Profit after tax_ As a result of the foregoing factors, profit after tax increased £7.3 million, or 24.3%, from £30.0 million in 2018 to £37.3 million in 2019. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

(3) Leverage is calculated as Secured Net Debt over Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is £131.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. See note 8 in “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Summary Historical Consolidated _Financial Information—Other Financial Data” for information on how Adjusted EBITDA is calculated._ (4) The key measure used by the Group for managing liquidity risk is liquidity headroom, which includes cash and cash equivalents and the headroom under committed facilities, being the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility. After giving effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, from the Issue Date, liquidity headroom will include cash and cash equivalents and the headroom under committed facilities, the Revolving Facility. Liquidity headroom excludes certain cash which may be subject to constraints regarding when the balance can be remitted, such as cash in a consolidated securitization structure awaiting a payment date. (5) Represents Net Debt/84-Month ERC. (6) Represents Secured Net Debt/84-Month ERC. We are highly operationally cash generative before purchases of investment portfolios. Adjusted EBITDA in the six months ended June 30, 2021 was £131.2 million, representing 11% of our Net Debt. We believe we have a prudently managed balance sheet. As noted in the table above, as of June 30, 2021, our Secured Net Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA or leverage was 4.7 times compared to 5.1 times as at December 31, 2020. We are targeting our leverage to reach 4.0 times by the end of 2021 (before incurring costs of approximately £85 million related to the Acquisition), and to be within our target range of approximately 3.0-3.5 times by 2023. These targets are indicative only and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve such targets within the planned time frame or at all. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This _Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_ As of June 30, 2021, our borrowings under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility, pre-netting of transaction fees, were £201.5 million, compared to £277.5 million as of ----- December 31, 2020. We maintained a strong cash and liquidity position during 2020, having raised an additional €104.7 million through the Euro Non-Recourse Facility in July 2020. As of the Issue Date, the Arrow Global Revolving Facility was cancelled and the Revolving Facility was partially drawn. A portion of the proceeds of the Notes will be used to repay the Existing Notes and a portion of the drawings under the Revolving Facility. As of the Issue Date, after giving effect to the Transactions and use of proceeds therefrom, we expect that £55 million will be drawn and outstanding under the Revolving Facility. We expect that our increased focus on reducing capital intensity and growing earnings from our capital-light businesses will result in higher levels of cash generation and lower requirements to invest in portfolios to generate cash returns in the future. Furthermore, the Offering of the Notes is expected to increase the level of liquidity headroom from £190 million as of the year ended December 31, 2020 to £347 million after completion of the Offering. See “Use of Proceeds.” Our ability to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The decrease was principally due to higher portfolio purchases during the six months ended June 30, 2021 of £94.8 million as compared to £42.9 million in the corresponding period in 2020, partially offset by higher payments of deferred consideration on portfolios incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Net cash used in investing activities increased by £5.2 million, or 42%, from £12.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to £17.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was largely due to the increased payment of deferred consideration paid in connection with subsidiary acquisitions of £8.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to £3.3 million in the corresponding period in 2020. Net cash generated by financing activities decreased £102.1 million, from a cash generation of £15.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to a cash usage of £86.4 million during ----- the six months ended June 30, 2021. This was primarily as a result of utilizing cash balances to repay amounts drawn under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility and amounts drawn under the Non-Recourse Facilities. The proceeds from the tap offering of the 2026 Notes executed in early 2021 were used to similarly repay amounts drawn under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility. _Cash flow for year ended 2020 compared to cash flow for year ended 2019_ Net cash generated by operating activities increased £35.0 million, from £6.5 million in 2019 to £41.5 million in 2020. The increase was principally due to lower investments in portfolio purchases, offset by lower collections. Investments in portfolios reduced from £303.7 million in 2019 to £109.9 million in 2020, partly due to our preservation of cash resources as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and partly due to our new investment model of co-investing alongside the Fund. Collections decreased from £442.3 million in 2019 to £338.9 million in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Impact of _the COVID-19 pandemic.”_ Net cash used in investing activities decreased £6.9 million, or 24.7%, from £27.9 million in 2019 to £21.0 million in 2020. This decrease was largely due to lower payments of deferred consideration paid in connection with subsidiary acquisitions, which decreased from £12.0 million in 2019 to £7.1 million in 2020. Net cash generated by financing activities increased £32.8 million, from £7.5 million in 2019 to £40.3 million in 2020. This was primarily due to withdrawal of dividends in 2020 by the Target following the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 6, 2020, the Target announced its intention to withdraw the recommended final dividend for 2019, preserving £15.0 million of cash within the business. No interim dividend was payable in 2020 and as a result, dividends paid reduced from £23.1 million in 2019 to £nil in 2020. _Cash flow for year ended 2019 compared to cash flow for year ended 2018_ Net cash generated by operating activities increased £25.5 million, from used in operating activities of £19.0 million in 2018 to net cash generated by operating activities of £6.5 million in 2019. During 2020, cash and cash equivalents of £12.9 million (2019: £26.6 million) may be subject to constraints depending on when the balance can be remitted, such as cash in a consolidated securitization structure awaiting a payment date. Previously, such amounts were shown in debtors and, as such, the 2019 cash flow was re-presented to remove these amounts from the movement in other receivables, as in the prior year they were included within this line item, and included within cash and cash equivalents. The net cash generated by operating activities (prior to this restatement) was £20.5 million. Prior to the restatement, net cash generated by operating activities increased £39.5 million, from net cash used in operating activities of £19.0 million in 2018 to net cash generated by operating activities of £20.5 million in 2019. The increase was principally due to higher collections during 2019 of £442.3 million (2018: £411.6 million) and an increase in other receivables, partially offset by higher portfolio investments of £303.7 million (2018: £263.4 million). ----- Net cash used in investing activities decreased £50.4 million, or 64.4%, from £78.3 million in 2018 to £27.9 million in 2019. This decrease was largely due to the amount of £57.0 million paid for the acquisition of subsidiaries including Parr Credit, Europa Investimenti, Norfin and Bergen, with only £2.9 million being incurred in 2019. See “Business—Our History and _Development.”_ Net cash generated by financing activities decreased £145.7 million, from £153.2 million in 2018 to £7.5 million in 2019. This was primarily due to the issuance of Existing Notes in 2018. On March 7, 2018, Arrow Global Finance Plc issued the 2026 Notes at a coupon of 3.75% over three-month EURIBOR and also issued £100 million additional 2024 Notes. As part of the transaction, Arrow Global Finance Plc also redeemed its 2023 Notes. The proceeds were used to fund the purchase price for the acquisition of Parr Credit, partially repay drawings under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility and to fund transaction costs and the redemption of the 2023 Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

We manage liquidity risk by monitoring a number of metrics, including leverage, levels of our cash and headroom under our Revolving Facility, headroom under the financial covenant within our Revolving Facility, the diversification of our funding sources, our external credit ratings and the period to maturity of our Notes, Revolving Facility and Non-Recourse Facilities. These metrics are reviewed on an actual historical basis, but also, where appropriate, on a forward-looking view through our budgeting process. This holistic review to liquidity risk is important to ensure that the risk is appropriately managed. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our business, which led to a reduction in Cash Collections and therefore, an increase in leverage. However, during the first quarter of 2020 at the on-set of the pandemic, we reported leverage of 3.4 times as at December 31, 2019, within our target range of approximately 3.0-3.5 times. None of our Existing Notes or Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility outstanding at the time had a maturity date ahead of January 2024. We had cash and headroom on our committed Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility as at March 30, 2020 of £129 million and we had good diversification of funding sources that enabled us to quickly access additional liquidity with the drawdown under our Sterling Asset-Backed Loan of £21.0 million on April 2, 2020. The strong position ahead of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the actions taken to preserve our liquidity resources, such as curtailing shareholder dividends and reducing the level of portfolio investments, ensured that liquidity risk continued to be minimized. As a result of the disruption to collections caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we approached our lenders under our Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility outstanding at the time and sought a relaxation of the leverage financial covenant. On August 12, 2020, we executed an amendment agreement with our lenders to amend the financial covenants under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility. The amendments to the financial covenants were for the period from ----- September 2020 up to and including June 2022 and provided suitable headroom based on our downside projections at the time, including an amendment to the maximum permitted leverage and minimum liquidity, and transitioned to a more dynamic margin calculation. Importantly, our lenders did not impose any restrictions on the level of portfolio acquisitions that we could make and provided a medium-term amendment to the financial covenants, in part as the Existing Notes were not due for repayment before 2024. The Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility was cancelled on or about October 19, 2021 and replaced by the Revolving Facility.

This primarily relates to our euro-denominated portfolios acquired by UK legal entities, euro-denominated intra-group loans from a UK entity to an overseas subsidiary to fund either euro-denominated portfolios or historical acquisitions. We use euro-denominated borrowings, through our Notes and our Revolving Facility, to ensure that positions are closely matched, thereby minimizing the impact of any translational gains and losses; (b) profits from our overseas operations can vary when translated to pounds sterling for reporting purposes. It is our policy not to hedge this exposure; and (c) cash flows arising in a different currency from our base accounting currency, such as dividend receipts paid in euros to a UK holding company and receipts of fund management fees. It is our policy to hedge such exposures when they are considered highly likely and they are significant. Furthermore, there can be impacts that do not create an exposure to our reported results. For example, our Revolving Facility has a fixed sterling commitment and therefore, the headroom can reduce due to market fluctuations on any euro borrowings made under the facility. Similarly, the reported leverage may increase or decrease merely due to the conversion of our eurodenominated debt. We have historically reduced the risk of our foreign currency exposure predominantly through borrowing in euros under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility and, less frequently, using forward foreign exchange contracts. The fair value and nominal value of foreign exchange contracts was nil as at December 31, 2020 and nil as at June 30, 2021. ----- _Foreign currency sensitivity analysis_ If foreign exchange rates had been 10% weaker than sterling at the balance sheet date and all other variables were held constant, our net assets for euros would decrease as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The objectives of our policy are firstly, to seek to limit the impact of a shock to interest rates to our profits for the current and next financial years within acceptable levels, and second, to broadly match the level of fixed rate debt, together with any interest rate swap contracts, to an approximate profile of the maturity of our portfolio investments. We typically use interest rate swap contracts to achieve our objective by seeking to hedge a portion of our floating rate borrowings.

As a result of the takeover of AGG by Bidco, we intend to prepare consolidated financial statements for the Parent, the parent company of Bidco. The Parent, Bidco and the Issuer have been incorporated solely for the purposes of the Acquisition. The only activities of these companies relate to the acquisition of AGG as described above, the execution of the Revolving Facility and the offering of the Notes hereby. As such, the only assets, liabilities, revenues and costs within these entities relate to the costs of completion of the Transactions. We estimate that the total costs of the Transactions will be approximately £85 million, and all or part of these costs may be paid for with the proceeds of the Offering. See “Description of Key Performance MetricsProfit _before and after tax (before exceptional items).”_ As such, the results presented in this Offering Memorandum are prepared on a different basis from the results in future periods. It should be noted that none of these changes that arise from the business combination accounting policies change cash or cash flows of the Parent or any of its subsidiaries and as such, the accounting basis for calculating leverage, Adjusted EBITDA and liquidity headroom will remain unchanged for future periods. Below is a list of what we believe are the material areas where reporting in future periods may differ from the current reported results of the Group: 1. _Goodwill: Goodwill was £269.5 million as at June 30, 2021 and is currently held on the balance sheet of the Group. This goodwill will no longer be reported when ----- preparing the consolidated results of the Parent. However, the Parent will report goodwill and acquired intangible assets as a result of the purchase of AGG. The level of goodwill will be dependent upon the difference between the consideration paid under the Acquisition and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of AGG at the time of the Acquisition. This fair value will be different from the reported assets and liabilities within the consolidated results of AGG, which in some cases are reported at historic cost, in line with IFRS. 2. _Portfolio investment carrying value: As noted above, under our accounting for business combinations, the identifiable net assets acquired are measured at fair value. This applies to all assets, such as fixed assets, and liabilities. In particular, portfolio investments held at amortized cost and held as inventories will, under the consolidated results of the Parent, be recognized initially at their fair value rather than under their current historic cost accounting value. Any change to the carrying value going forward would result in a change to the revenue recognized through the profit and loss of the Parent’s consolidated results going forward. As at June 30, 2021, the carrying value of portfolio investments – amortized cost, which are recognized at historic cost was £735.4 million. As part of the disclosures within our reported results as at June 30, 2021, we estimated the fair value of such portfolios at £880.4 million, an uplift of £145.0 million. Fair value has been calculated by observing the compression in market yields over time and applying the difference between current average market IRRs for our most recent vintage, and applying this as a premium or discount to prior years’ vintages. This approach takes into account changes in market pricing factors over time, while retaining the consideration of the individual characteristics of each portfolio. As part of the acquisition accounting process, a more rigorous review of each portfolio would need to be undertaken and, as such, the actual fair value at the acquisition date is likely to be different to the indicative fair value estimate shown within our historical financial disclosure information. Any uplift to the carrying value of our portfolio investments will reduce the revenue recognized in future periods on such portfolios within the consolidated results of the Parent. 3. _Debt carrying value: The carrying value of our debt includes unamortized upfront costs of arranging the debt. As at June 30, 2021, there was £12.9 million of unamortized debt costs relating to the Existing Notes and the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility held on our balance sheet. Given the refinancing of our debt that existed at the time of the Acquisition, it is expected that the fair value of this unamortized debt will be minimal and hence will impact the level of goodwill arising within the consolidated results of the Parent. 4. _Intangible amortization: The acquisition of intangible assets, which arose upon the acquisition of AGG by the Parent, primarily relates to customer relationships and ----- brands. When we acquire businesses and when the Parent acquired AGG, which has material ongoing customer relationships, whether contractual or otherwise, the principles of IFRS 3 require that the fair value of such customer relationships must be estimated and recognized on the balance sheet at the acquisition date. The impact of this is to effectively reduce the goodwill recognized on acquisition. Subsequent to the initial recognition of such assets, the assets are amortized over the expected life of the customer relationships with us. This amortization is recognized within operating expenses. The useful lives and carrying values of customer intangibles are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. As such, the creation of the customer and brand intangibles, and associated non-cash amortization thereof, will reduce the reported consolidated profits of the Parent in the future, although such non-cash item will be separately identifiable. 5. _Statutory reporting periods: Since the Parent was incorporated on March 29, 2021, it is our intention to prepare audited consolidated results of the Parent for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. In line with accounting standards, these results will reflect the results of AGG and its subsidiaries from the time of the Acquisition to December 31, 2021 only. Since AGG will no longer be required to prepare audited consolidated accounts for AGG and its subsidiaries, it will not be possible to view statutory audited accounts for the year ended December 31, 2021 that incorporate the results for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 of AGG and its subsidiaries. It is our intention to publish key financial information and metrics covering the twelve months as pro-forma unaudited figures to aid comparison.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.76,"Key accounting policies, judgements and assumptions and estimates",17.76.2,Key accounting judgements,"We regularly make judgements, when preparing our consolidated financial statements, which affect the application of our accounting policies and our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. As such, our actual results may differ from these judgments. The judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting judgments are recognized in the year in which the judgment is revised. The following are the key accounting judgements that have been made when preparing our financial statements: _Classification of portfolio investment assets_ We hold the majority of our portfolio investments at amortized cost, due to the fact that we have determined that these assets meet the SPPI criteria and are held in a ‘hold to collect’ business model. The SPPI criteria for each portfolio are assessed at the point each portfolio is being approved for purchase and are based on the nature of the underlying loans which are being purchased. This determination is made for each purchase individually, unless it is a follow-on purchase of the same or very similar assets, which have already been assessed. With respect to the ‘hold to collect’ business model, we have determined that this is the most appropriate IFRS 9 business model classification for its general portfolio holding activities, ----- as although in the past a small number of portfolios have been sold outright to a third party, such sales do not comprise a material component of our ERC at any point in time. Therefore, we believe that such infrequent sales activity is not deemed to invalidate the ‘hold to collect’ business model which we employ for the majority of our portfolios. Another judgement that has been made regarding the Group’s amortized cost portfolio assets is that they all fall within the purchased or originated credit-impaired (“POCI”) classification for IFRS 9 impairment measurement purposes. This judgement has been made, based on the fact that historic purchase history and the current composition of our amortized cost portfolio investments shows that such assets tend to be bought at a point in time where they are credit impaired in some manner. This is supported by not only the nature of the assets, but by the fact that they are usually purchased at a steep discount, which is reflective of their incurred credit losses to date. For some portfolio investments, the SPPI criteria are not met, or there is an element of subordination within the holding structure. In such instances, these portfolio investments are held at FVTPL. Furthermore, some portfolio investments, such as those involving real estate, do not meet the definition of a financial instrument for accounting purposes. This leads to a portion of our portfolio investments being classified as ‘inventories’ under the scope of IAS 2. Our co-investment alongside our Fund and Investment Management business is deemed to be held in a different ‘business model’ than ‘hold to collect,’ as these portfolio investments are managed primarily on a fair value basis, with reporting to senior management on the performance of these assets being prepared on that basis, and key management remuneration being linked to the performance of such assets on a fair value basis. As such, the ‘business model’ of these portfolios is neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell the Portfolio Assets. As such, our co-investment alongside the Fund and other co-investment portfolios purchased alongside other third-parties are classified as FVTPL. _Determination of control over investees_ We hold an economic interest in a number of entities which we determine under IFRS 10, that we do not control. As such, these entities are not consolidated into our financial statements, but rather, the investment in such entities is recognized as a single asset within the appropriate balance sheet classification, usually portfolio investments. Conversely, we also consolidate entities into its financial statements which we do not have 100% ownership of, but we are judged to control regardless. The judgement as to whether or not we have control over an entity is taken on a case-bycase basis by management, and is firstly based on whether we can exercise any power over the relevant activities of the entity, and if this is the case, whether there is deemed to be a link between such power and the variability of returns that arise from the entity. In many cases, the determination of control is clear. Cases where management must apply more judgement can occur where we hold a minority equity-level financial interest in a structured entity, as well as providing services to these entities in a typical supplier-customer relationship capacity. In these cases, we mainly assess the relative share of marginal variable returns which ----- flow to third parties versus the share which flows to ourselves as a primary indicator of whether we are exercising any power we may have to influence the variable returns of the structured entity, either for its benefit, or for the benefit of third parties in the structure. In the case of the former, the entity will usually be consolidated, whereas under the latter, the entity will usually not be consolidated.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.76,"Key accounting policies, judgements and assumptions and estimates",17.76.3,Key Accounting Assumptions and Estimates,"In addition to our accounting judgements, we also regularly make estimates and assumptions, when preparing our consolidated financial statements, that affect the application of our accounting policies and our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. As such, our actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised. The following are the key accounting assumptions and estimates that have been made when preparing our consolidated financial statements: _Carrying value of portfolio investments_ As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of portfolio investments was £1,042.2 million compared with £1,163.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The majority of our portfolio investments are measured at amortized cost. However, under our business combination accounting policies, on completion of the Acquisition, there will be a requirement to fair value our assets and liabilities. See “Key accounting policies, judgements and assumptions and estimatesKey _Accounting Policies.”_ Given the speed and severity of the economic changes that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought, we further refined the method by which ERCs, and therefore portfolio valuations, are calculated for the year ended December 31, 2020. For earlier periods, a bottom-up approach was taken whereby each individual portfolio’s cash flow was modelled based on a number of factors, including Balance Sheet Cash Collections history and an array of data concerning the status of the individual loans within our portfolios, for example account-specific Balance Sheet Cash Collections history, account statuses, property statuses and valuations (for secured accounts), servicer history, and supporting data from third parties such as credit files or geo-demographics. This data has then been used in conjunction with the predicted effectiveness of any additional collection initiatives to forecast future Balance Sheet Cash Collections for each portfolio. These forecast Balance Sheet Cash Collections are then updated for actual Cash Collections, before being used as the basis for the December 31 and June 30 reforecast at each reporting date. Management believes that the nature of the current crisis has caused a temporary dislocation in how Cash Collections will trend, based on Cash Collections data during 2020 and into 2021. Accordingly, we have instead sought to determine how the anticipated more volatile macroeconomic environment may impact the bottom-up portfolio-level ERC forecasts, through a series of overlays, taking into account forecast future macroeconomic circumstances. To achieve ----- this, each of our portfolios was first divided into a specified number of risk segments, with each segment containing loans of a similar nature (for example, UK unsecured loans). In addition, individually material and/or complex portfolios were also considered separately as their own ‘segment.’ For each segment, for the most relevant macroeconomic indicators, a range of possible future outcomes was forecast, each representing either an upside, downside or severe downside scenario. The impact of each scenario on our future cash flows was determined in conjunction with our internal experts in the relevant segment, considering both past experience and knowledge about the current condition of the local environment. Using statistical methods, a probability was also assigned to each segment-level scenario, giving consideration to updated external macroeconomic forecasts, actual Cash Collections performance throughout the year and local in-house knowledge. These probabilities assigned were then used to calculate a probability-weighted ERC change for each segment, save for a small number of individual portfolios in which management judgement was applied. The weighted segment-level adjustments were then applied to each portfolio within each respective segment to allow the production of portfolio-level ERC curves. The portfolio-level ERC curves were then discounted at the appropriate rate (EIR for amortized cost portfolios, a rate reflective of assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset for FVTPL portfolios), to obtain the revised NPV and hence carrying value of the amortized cost and FVTPL portfolio investments. For return on equity portfolio investments, the revised ERC curve was used to determine the net realizable value in assessing each portfolio for potential impairment. To assist with the understanding of how the Group has modelled future cash flows, which ultimately drives the valuation of the portfolio investment assets, the below table shows the probability that has been assigned to each macroeconomic scenario when preparing the cash flow forecasts:",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

In addition to the scenario modelling set out above, another key judgement that has been applied by management is the probability weighting of each of these scenarios. The precise weightings used have been set out above and were based on management’s judgement on how each of our scenarios aligns to the macroeconomic forecasts provided by third party experts, as well as the view of local internal experts in the relevant geography and asset class. Such scenarios also take into account operational considerations that may impact Cash Collections in each individual geography, such as the functioning of local court systems or property markets for example. The estimated future cash flows generated by the above process are the key estimate/judgement in our financial statements. Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by +1/-1% would impact the closing carrying value of the amortized cost and FVTPL portfolio investments as at December 31, 2020 and as at December 31, 2019 by +/- £9.8 million and +/£11.0 million, respectively. The forecasting period over which ERCs are calculated is also a key estimate/judgement in our financial statements. Adding or removing six months to the cash flow forecasting period would increase/(reduce) the closing carrying value of the portfolio investments as at December 31, |Year-end HPI rate (year-on-year) relative to Base (change in %)|Col2| |---|---| |Country Segment|Scenario Mild Severe Upside upside Base Stagnation Downside downside| |UK 2021 UK 2022 UK 2023 UK 2024 UK 2025|6.6 3.8 0.0 (4.9) (7.0) (10.6) 4.4 2.2 0.0 (6.5) (9.1) (13.8) 8.0 5.3 0.0 (4.2) (6.8) (11.9) 1.6 1.1 0.0 (0.8) (1.4) (2.7) (1.4) (0.2) 0.0 0.4 0.6 1.1| |Portugal 2021 Portugal 2022 Portugal 2023 Portugal 2024 Portugal 2025|8.1 5.1 0.0 (3.8) (5.7) (9.0) 6.5 4.2 0.0 (3.0) (4.7) (7.7) 5.0 3.3 0.0 (2.5) (4.0) (6.8) 0.4 0.3 0.0 (0.2) (0.3) (0.6) (0.4) (0.2) 0.0 0.2 0.3 0.6| |The Netherlands 2021 The Netherlands 2022 The Netherlands 2023 The Netherlands 2024 The Netherlands 2025|7.9 5.0 0.0 (3.5) (5.3) (8.4) 15.6 10.1 0.0 (6.7) (10.5) (17.2) 2.5 1.7 0.0 (1.4) (2.3) (4.0) 0.8 0.6 0.0 (0.5) (0.8) (1.5) (0.4) (0.3) 0.0 0.3 0.4 0.8| |Italy 2021 Italy 2022 Italy 2023 Italy 2024 Italy 2025|2.8 1.7 0.0 (1.6) (2.3) (3.6) 3.3 2.1 0.0 (1.4) (2.2) (3.5) 3.7 2.4 0.0 (1.7) (2.6) (4.2) 0.9 0.6 0.0 (0.4) (0.6) (1.0) (0.2) (0.1) 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3| |Ireland 2021 Ireland 2022 Ireland 2023 Ireland 2024 Ireland 2025|12.1 7.5 0.0 (5.4) (8.2) (12.9) 11.6 7.6 0.0 (5.6) (8.9) (14.8) 4.7 3.2 0.0 (2.7) (4.4) (7.8) (0.4) (0.3) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.7 (0.5) (0.3) 0.0 0.3 0.5 0.9| ----- 2020 by £8.6 million/(£11.0) million and as at December 31, 2019 by £12.5 million/(£17.3) million. The carrying value of our investments directly affects our total income and, as such, the estimation of the ERC will impact not just the carrying value of the portfolio investments, but also our total income. See “Description of Key Statement of Profit or Loss and Other ItemsTotal _Income.” Fair value of net assets acquired as part of business combinations_ We capitalize goodwill on the acquisition of entities. Goodwill is the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. Therefore, the fair value of assets acquired directly impacts the amount of goodwill recognized on acquisition. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired portfolio investments and customer intangibles where valuations reflect estimates of amounts and timing of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities. _Impairment assessment of goodwill balances_ The carrying amount of goodwill held on the AGG consolidated balance sheet is £278.3 million as at December 31, 2020. Following the Acquisition, consolidated accounts will now be prepared by the Parent and goodwill relating to the Acquisition will be created. See “Description _of Key Balance Sheet Statement ItemsGoodwill.” In line with our accounting policies, this newly_ formed goodwill balance will need to be assessed for impairment at each annual reporting date. The impairment assessment is expected to be carried out on a value in use basis, using discounted cash flow models for each CGU to determine whether the ongoing value in use of each CGU is higher than its carrying amount. For the goodwill held on the consolidated balance sheet of AGG, no impairment was recognized as a result of the assessment performed as at December 31, 2020 or in prior accounting periods. The assessment is sensitive to the discount rate applied, and management’s forecast future cash flows for each CGU.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.80,Recent Accounting Pronouncements,17.80.1,,"We were required to adopt IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) and IFRS 15 (Revenue for _Contracts with Customers) as of January 1, 2018._ IFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognizing and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement). IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics. With respect to impairment, IFRS 9 replaces the “incurred loss” model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking “expected credit loss” (“ECL”) model, which has a broader scope of application than IAS 39. This has the effect of recognizing impairment of purchased loan portfolios and loan notes earlier than at present. The estimation of ECLs requires considerable judgement since they should include an assessment of forward-looking ----- economic assumptions which are determined on a probability-weighted basis based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. IFRS 9 requires an unbiased and probability weighted estimate of credit losses by evaluation of a range of possible outcomes that incorporates forecasts of future economic conditions. Measurement of ECLs at each reporting period should utilize reasonable and supportable information at the reporting date about past events and current conditions, in order to inform forecasts of future economic conditions. In determining ECLs, we considered three economic scenarios, including assumptions on unemployment, gross domestic product and consumer price index, and weight these according to their likely occurrence. The scenarios included a central scenario, based on the current economic environment, and upside scenario and a downside scenario. The estimation and application of this forward-looking information required significant judgement and was subject to appropriate internal governance and scrutiny. Due to the nature of our portfolios and loan notes, all such assets have been classified into Stage 3 as POCI. ECL is not recognized on initial recognition. Instead, lifetime ECL is incorporated into the calculation of effective interest rate. Any changes in lifetime ECL after initial recognition are recognized in profit or loss. ECL calculation for POCI assets is always based on an ECL over the expected life of the asset. The new impairment model, implemented on the adoption of IFRS 9, applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost and financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, except for investments in equity instruments (which are measured at fair value through profit or loss, except where an election is made to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income), and to contract assets. Following assessments, it was concluded there was no material change to the classification and measurement of our financial assets, and the vast majority continued to be accounted for at amortized cost. There was a small number of purchased loan portfolios and loan notes with an estimated carrying value of approximately £60 million that were reclassified to being accounted for as at fair value through the profit or loss as a result of our assessment of cash flow characteristics. IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. We do not currently expect the application of IFRS 15 to result in significant difference in revenue recognition compared to current revenue recognition policies. We were required to adopt IFRS 16 (Leases) as of January 1, 2019. At inception of a contract, we assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, we use the definition of a lease in IFRS 16. At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, we allocate consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative standalone price. However, for leases of premises that we have elected not to separate non-lease components and accounts for, the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is ----- initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to premises. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the shorter of its useful economic life and the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our incremental borrowing rate. Generally, we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate by analyzing our borrowings from various external sources and make certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and - the exercise price under a purchase option that we are reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if we are reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless we are reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in our estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if we change our assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. The adjustment is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. We present right-of-use assets in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘trade and other payables’ in the statement of financial position. In addition, we have elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, including leases of IT equipment. We recognize the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Further, none of the arrangements that we have entered into have been determined to constitute us acting as a lessor under the definitions of IFRS 16. ----- Other than IFRS 9, 15 and 16, no other new or proposed accounting standards, to our knowledge, have or are expected to have a significant impact on our financial reporting. See generally note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum for details relating to new and revised accounting standards applicable to us. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The main acquirers of portfolios are closed-end funds and, as such, this primary market activity in turn creates a very large and attractive secondary market at the end of such closed-end fund’s life. Based on management estimates, we believe that the main acquirers of NPL portfolios will generally hold a portfolio for approximately six years on average and will expect to collect approximately half of the amounts outstanding in that time. Such closed-end funds will seek to sell their portfolios at the end of their fund life, which, given the primary activity building through to 2018, will lead to the creation of a significant secondary market that is expected to rise through until 2024. In many cases, the incumbent servicer, such as ourselves, is best placed to acquire the portfolio in the secondary market, given its knowledge of the portfolios performance and the frictional costs associated with changing a servicer.

Following the global financial crisis in 2008, NPLs in the European financial systems peaked at approximately €1.2 trillion. While NPLs had decreased to roughly half of that figure by the end of 2019, stress tests on banks by the ECB suggest that NPLs could reach a new peak at roughly €1.4 trillion as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented economic and social challenges. In the ten years following the global financial crisis, NPLs with a face value of approximately €700 billion traded through portfolio sales. Even with the unprecedented slowdown in transactions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is estimated that approximately €78 billion of NPLs traded through portfolio sales in 2020. In 2021, an estimated €30 billion has traded so far with a further €70 billion in the pipeline for the remainder of the year, bringing the total close to 2019 levels. Transactions worth approximately €100 billion are expected to trade in 2022. European NPL volumes peaked at approximately €1.2 trillion following the global financial crisis and decreased to approximately €600 billion by the end of 2019. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the EBA’s Q4 2020 Risk Dashboard indicates that the total stock of European bank NPLs, including the UK, decreased over the year to approximately €528 billion at the end of 2020. This decrease is likely attributable to COVID-19 related loan moratoria and other relief measures. ----- We believe that the economic and social challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a material increase in European NPL volumes, with the ECB’s stress tests suggesting that NPLs could peak at approximately €1.4 trillion, approximately €200 billion higher than the previous peak.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Deloitte, Deleveraging Europe June 2021, Italy: page 12. 2. Q1 2021 EBA Risk Dashboard report, page 39 for Ireland data as of December 2020._ In Q4 2020, loans under EBA-eligible moratoria almost halved, decreasing from €587 billion at the end of Q3 2020 to €318 billion, with exposures to non-financial companies declining the most. Meanwhile, the proportion of Stage 2 loans under non-expired moratoria continued an upward trend, standing at 26.4% in Q4 2020, up by 6.2 percentage points from Q3 2020. Although it is still early to draw conclusions about asset quality, it is noteworthy that the proportion of Stage 2 loans under moratoria is almost three times higher than the 9.1% ratio for total loans across Europe, emphasizing the potential downside risks once the moratoria expire. _Source: Deloitte, Deleveraging Europe June 2021, Italy: page 13._ ----- During the same time, the proportion of loans under public guarantee schemes across EBA banks increased by 19% reaching €343 billion during Q4 2020, up from €289 billion at the end of Q3 2020.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.84,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,17.84.2,,"As a result of government imposed containment measures to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus, activity within the European NPL market was significantly curtailed during the first half of 2020, with activity increasing during the second half of that year, driven largely through the use of government-guaranteed securitization schemes. As a result of government support measures and the expected time lag before the effects of the initial economic shock, defaults and insolvencies are still at a moderate level across Europe. Many stakeholders are awaiting the impact of the unwinding of government support measures (e.g., the end of various loan moratoria). If the recovery is slow and protracted, a rise in credit losses could reasonably push NPL stocks in some countries close to or over the levels reached during the 2007/2008 global financial crisis. There is also a real risk that a so called “zombie” class of borrowers will emerge, being those who have been propped up financially by government and other COVID-19-related support measures but who are susceptible to defaulting on their loans after such government support has been withdrawn. The ECB has acknowledged that most banks are adopting prudent financial projections in their reporting since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as consensus of a stronger than expected recovery has grown, the ECB has stressed continued caution ahead of releasing any provisions. A particular concern is the steady growth of Stage 2 loans, a leading indicator for future NPLs that, according to the EBA, rose to 9.1% of total loans across Europe in December 2020 from 6.5% in December 2019, and rose to 13.4% of total loans in the UK in December 2020 from 7.7% in December 2019. This area will be a key focus of potential stress as government measures come to an end. With even a subset of these loans souring to NPLs, banks would face a significant challenge and see a material rise in NPL volumes. According to a Deloitte report titled Deleveraging Europe _(June 2021), banks in the UK will continue to assess their post-Brexit and post-COVID-19_ pandemic requirements, and we expect to see several non-core disposals over the course of 2021 and into 2022, as banks accelerate plans to wind down and deleverage non-core assets, whether through equity sales or pure asset trades. According to the EBA’s September 2020 survey, more than 75% of European banks were expecting a deterioration in asset quality for corporate portfolios as well as consumer credit. Unlike the global financial crisis in 2007/2008, the exposures with the greatest stress are concentrated in sectors such as retail, leisure and hospitality, where borrowers have been most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the largest banks in Europe, approximately €118.1 billion of provisions were set aside during 2020, doubling the €54.5 billion set aside in 2019, as banks frontloaded their expected credit losses. Of this total, €76.5 billion of loan losses were provisioned in the first half of the year, with a substantial drop in the second half of the year to €41.6 billion, as economic forecasts showed slight signs of a recovery. The average NPL ratio across EBA banks fell in Q4 2020 by 20bps to 2.6%. This lower NPL ratio reflects both a reduction in NPL volumes and also an increase in total loans and advances, including those through government-backed loan support schemes launched in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.85,The debt collection and debt servicing market,17.85.1,Specialization and standardization,"The European debt collection and debt servicing market is idiosyncratic with varying operating and regulatory models across countries and asset classes. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to the Regulation of our Business.” Increasingly, market participants need to be able to_ provide highly specialized end-to-end services in the management, collection and servicing of loan portfolios including ancillary services connected to the core servicing activity, such as due diligence, legal, data governance and data-quality, real estate, across a number of geographies and asset classes. Despite some of the jurisdictional differences and increasing specialization, the European debt collection and servicing industry is also becoming more standardized and integrated as markets mature, competition increases and regulators begin to play a larger role. Regulators, such as the EBA, are attempting to harmonize jurisdictional differences in the market and to promote cross-border firms through regulation. In the first quarter of 2020, the EBA published an update to the Credit Servicers Directive, which is based on the best practice observed in Ireland and Spain, countries hardest hit by the 2007/2008 global financial crisis. The Directive aims to blend best practices and level the playing field for competition, to encourage new market entrants and deepen liquidity of the NPL market. Recommendations include a passporting regime, data standardization and infrastructure. This will likely result in the standardization of processes, operations, data requirements, etc. across the European market. All of this means that operators need to have broad capabilities so that they are able to operate across a number of geographies and asset classes allowing them to build an established and scalable presence to better compete in the market. While increased regulation will undoubtedly increase the cost of doing business, operators are already one step ahead and are investing heavily in technology and people to enhance operational effectiveness and flexibility in order to maintain and improve their margins and financial performance. As the debt collection and servicing market in Europe continues to transform, with debt collectors and servicers investing to meet market demand and exploit growth opportunities, it is likely that in the medium to long term, small players may merge with large international servicing platforms, thereby leveraging strong economies of scale, competence and commercial presence, contributing to market concentration. Overall, the highly competitive European debt collection and servicing market is likely to result in firms specializing in markets where they outperform the market. The larger operators will continue to manage large NPL portfolios and securitization, while smaller operators will focus on local markets for secondary and tertiary portfolios. ----- A trend that continues to gain prominence in the European debt collection and servicing market is the increasing willingness of banks and other lenders to outsource their debt collection and servicing to specialist providers not only for their NPL portfolios but across their performing portfolios as well. The COVID-19 pandemic has put banks under a lot of operational pressure, coupled with the dynamics playing out in the broader macroeconomic environment, banks’ margins and profitability are also under increasing pressure. As a result, banks are increasingly focusing on their core competencies in the origination of loans and looking to others with core competencies in debt collection and servicing to replace some of their in-house functions where they do not consider themselves to have an advantage. See “Business—Our Key Strengths— _Attractive market with strong growth drivers.” This creates a very material and attractive_ opportunity for debt collectors and servicers with a desire to expand in this part of the market which typically comes with higher quality recurring revenues without the capital and liquidity intensity of a debt purchasing business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.85,The debt collection and debt servicing market,17.85.2,,"Generally, the debt collection or debt servicing business model consists of the provision of debt collection services on behalf of a third-party (typically the debt originator). Debt servicers usually receive a fee related either to the face value of the debt portfolio under management or on the basis of the collections generated. Debt servicers can provide third-party collection services for either performing or non-performing debt. The latter can be particularly burdensome for debt originators, as non-performing debt tends to entail significant efforts both in terms of time and special skills and resources required. As a result, debt originators often decide to outsource debt collection functions to specialized debt servicers as the latter have dedicated competencies, experience and more appropriate structures to perform these activities. Additionally, debt originators may decide to externalize some of their accounts to debt servicers to compare their internal recovery performance with that of a specialized third-party provider. There are a number of business models in the market: _Third-party servicing only_ Collection and servicing of portfolios on behalf of a third-party, typically, a fund, a bank or a utility company, without any direct investment in the underlying loan portfolio. _Debt purchasing and collection_ Direct investment in or acquisition of an underlying portfolio from a third-party debt originator and collection and servicing of acquired portfolios for the debt purchaser’s benefit. _Hybrid debt purchasing, collection and third-party servicing_ A hybrid combination of debt purchasing and collection whereby a debt purchaser acquires, collects and services portfolios for their own benefit but also provides its expert debt collection and servicing capabilities to third-parties creating a more diversified and stable business model. _Fund management_ Direct investment in or acquisition of an underlying portfolio on behalf of other investors. Fund managers typically employ the services of one of the above business models to collect and service the portfolios they have acquired and earn management and performance fees from their investors. _Integrated asset manager_ We are an integrated asset manager operating in the European NPL market that combines debt purchasing, debt servicing and fund management, where the three business models are ----- complementary to one another, fully integrated and able to maximize the synergistic benefits across their revenue channels and cost base.

See “—Market participants.” Fund or asset managers are a subset of the broader universe of market participants and they include: _Global debt funds_ These are large funds with a global presence, typically focused on investing only with reliance on others for their debt collection and servicing. Based on our past experience, global debt funds will normally invest in excess of €150 million in a typical transaction. Key participants include PIMCO, CarVal, Oaktree, Cerberus, Blackstone, Fortress, KKR, LoneStar, among others. _Local (European) debt funds_ These are large funds with a more local presence.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.86,Alternative investment management,17.86.2,,"Private debt emerged as a core alternative asset class after the 2007/2008 global financial crisis and has once again proved its value and importance in supporting businesses and the economy as a whole in a volatile year, with the COVID-19 driven slowdown driving total assets to new highs. According to data from Preqin, AUM increased to $887 billion as of June 2020, making private debt the third largest among the private capital asset classes, followed by private equity and real estate. Funds continued to flow into the asset class as private debt investments offered higher returns as compared to public debt investments given the low interest rate environment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The $118 billion raised across 200 private debt funds in 2020 was approximately 10% down on both measures from 2019, though almost a quarter of funds raised 125% or more of their initial targets. Undrawn commitments stood at $320 billion as of December 2020, up 19% from a year prior. A combination of reduced M&A and surplus liquidity in other debt pools slowed investment and deployment rates. Increasing competition and the amount of capital chasing deals will likely put pressure on returns across the asset class, although opportunities for higher returns exist in more value-added strategies, such as NPLs or distressed debt. Private debt is no longer considered a niche product Preqin has reported that approximately 81% of global LP investors expect to increase their allocation to alternative investments, including private debt. In particular, distressed debt and special situations have been an area of growth for most private credit managers. The proportion of capital allocated to the two latter strategies has been increasing over the last ten years, up from 16% in 2009 to 40% in 2020. Distressed debt AUM increased by $9 billion over 2020, driven by a 15% increase in un-deployed capital. While the increase in commitments was due in part to expectations of a surge in distressed and restructuring deals, emergency government stimulus measures and government guaranteed loan facilities prevented, or at least delayed, distress for many customers and companies, as previously described. According to a 2020 Global Private Debt report by Pitchbook, our inaugural fund raise for the Fund ranked as the third largest credit fundraise in special situations globally in 2020 and the fourth largest private credit raise in Europe. Further, our inaugural fund raise for the Fund ranked ----- as the largest inaugural fundraise in private debt globally in 2020 based on the information available to us. See “Business—Our Key Strengths—Attractive market with strong growth _drivers.”_ As the asset class has grown and competition has increased, aggregate returns have trended downwards but remain attractive relative to other fixed-income markets. Direct lending, which offers greater security, generated a median IRR of 8.3% for vintage years 2008 to 2017, with a standard deviation of just 5.0%, according to data from Preqin. Distressed debt returns have been more varied over the same period, with a standard deviation of 9.7%, but a higher return of 9.2%. Investors can choose the point on the risk-return spectrum that best fits their mandates and needs. Overall, as illustrated in the chart below, investors across the board plan to increase their exposure to private debt relative to their current exposure. _Source: Preqin, Preqin Global Private Debt Report 2021, page 40._ The majority of investors interested in the private debt asset class are, perhaps unsurprisingly, based in North America with European investors a clear but distant second as a proportion of all investors, as shown in the chart below. _Source: Preqin, Preqin Global Private Debt Report 2021, page 40._ These trends are primarily driven by the returns available in the private debt market, notably distressed debt markets such as the European NPL market. It is common for these markets to outperform other comparable investments, particularly after periods of economic stress. This was evident following the global financial crisis in 2008 and a similar outperformance is expected ----- following the COVID-19 pandemic. Even on a simple average basis, the returns generated by debt purchasers and collectors typically outperform other comparable investments by some margin.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.87,BUSINESS Overview,17.87.1,,"Established in 2005, we are a leading European investor and asset manager of debt in the non-performing and non-core assets sector, principally operating in the UK, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy and Ireland. As of June 30, 2021, we had £4.8 billion of FUM, £1,028 million in portfolio investments, £1,572 million 84-month ERC, £1,733 million 120-month ERC, and, in the six months ended June 30, 2021, generated Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the amount of £90.7 million. We operate as an integrated asset manager, a unique model with three operating divisions that provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. See “—Our businesses” below and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our _Business Model.” Our model focuses on generating higher levels of capital-light revenue and, as_ such, is a comparatively less capital-intensive model than many other businesses that operate in our sector. Our three operating divisions are detailed below: 1. _Fund and Investment Management: Our Fund and Investment Management business invests third-party committed capital on behalf of our clients and includes the management of our inaugural discretionary closed-end fund, Arrow Credit Opportunities, with total capital commitments of €1.7 billion, together with Norfin, Europa Investimenti and Sagitta; 2. _Asset Management and Servicing: Our Asset Management and Servicing platforms service and manage collections and other activities related to portfolio investments, on behalf of both our Fund and Investment Management business and our Balance Sheet business, as well as third-party clients. We have built market-leading positions, niche-dominant platforms and competitive servicing platforms, with expertise in consumer, real estate, mortgage and SME NPLs and non-core asset servicing across the five jurisdictions in which we operate; and 3. _Balance Sheet: Our Balance Sheet business invests our own capital. Since the deployment of the Fund in 2020, our investments have typically been made by way of a co-investment alongside the Fund, via a 100% owned Jersey partnership, Arrow SMA. Going forward, we expect the Balance Sheet business to function primarily for the purpose of co-investment activities alongside the Fund as well as any future funds. We may, however, continue to make direct investments through this business for certain strategic reasons. The Balance Sheet business also incorporates the financial performance of the back book portfolio investments made prior to the launch of the Fund. Our businesses provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. Our Fund and Investment Management business, benefiting from our 15-year track record of delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns, invests on behalf of our Balance Sheet business, with typically 25% coinvestment in new portfolio investments alongside the Fund, and approximately 71% of these portfolio investments are currently serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing platforms. ----- We identify, acquire and service a wide range of secured and unsecured defaulted and noncore loan and real estate portfolios primarily from financial institutions, such as banks, institutional fund investors and specialist lenders, playing an active role in helping financial institutions reduce their balance sheets and re-capitalize in order to increase mainstream lending. By purchasing and managing NPLs and other non-core assets, we provide valuable capital and expertise to a growing European market. Our purpose is to help build better financial futures for our customers, clients, communities, employees and other stakeholders. As such, great importance is placed on achieving fair outcomes for customers through affordable repayment programs and helping them improve their credit score. We believe that we are one of the leading providers of debt purchase and receivables management solutions in the territories in which we operate. Through our platforms we have developed local knowledge of acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets. We offer a differentiated and diversified European NPL strategy by leveraging our deep local expertise across the five key European jurisdictions in which we operate. Our relevant track record and experience having operated in each of our core markets for a long time as well as our familiarity with each asset class provides us with a competitive advantage that is supported by local and experienced “on-the-ground” teams. In addition, our presence in these jurisdictions enables us to target smaller transactions in more sophisticated granular assets where local knowledge provides a competitive advantage and supports the creation of relationships with debt originators, enabling origination of off-market deals (i.e., deals not acquired through a process involving a competitive bid or an auction-like process). Our ability to meet our targets and deliver consistently high IRR on our portfolio investments is premised on several factors including our experienced investment professionals, our local expertise in acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets, our strong origination capabilities with broad reach enabling us to acquire a high level of off-market deals and our leading data analytics capabilities. Our proprietary database incorporates more than 15 years of collection and payment data, over 1,000 deals underwritten since our inception, 10 million customer accounts and over 10,000 of underlying properties across multiple geographies. As we accelerate our movement towards a capital-light strategy, which focuses more on the growth of the Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses, and less on our Balance Sheet business, this will result in a change in our financial characteristics. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Our Business Model.”_ As part of this shift, it is our intention that our integrated fund manager business model delivers: - an increase in FUM, with a similar or reduced level of portfolio investments held by our Balance Sheet business; - an increase in the proportion of the earnings of the business derived from our capital light businesses; ----- - an ability to target higher return on capital invested through a reduced use of our own balance sheet to provide returns; and - an increase in cash generation as capital-light revenues grow and less cash is required for re-investment in our own balance sheet assets, with a concomitant ability to delever the business. To support our transition to a capital-light strategy, we will leverage our strong track record and experience in working with partners through our historic co-investments as well as our longstanding relationships with many of the largest institutional investors in the market. The Fund represented the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally in 2020, the third largest credit fundraise in special situations globally in 2020 and the fourth largest private credit fundraise in Europe. Our track record of generating superior returns during economic dislocation combined with LP investors’ demand for private debt strategies provides a strong platform to continue to raise private funds for yield-seeking investors and our transition into a more profitable capitallight model.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.88,Our Key Strengths,17.88.1,Attractive market with strong growth drivers.,"We are a leading European investor and asset manager in the non-performing and non-core assets sector principally operating in the UK, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy and Ireland, with a 15-year track record of delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns. Debt originators generally use debt sales as a method for managing the economic, regulatory and commercial aspects of continued ownership of defaulted loans and non-core assets and to accelerate capital release for debts that are already fully or heavily provisioned. The debt purchase and debt servicing industry is a significant component of the debt recovery process in many markets and provides an attractive solution for debt originators facing increasing capital and liquidity regulatory requirements, thereby ultimately benefiting customers. See “Industry—The _debt collection and debt servicing market.” Our business model is designed to benefit from_ economic dislocation, which leads to an increase in the generation of non-performing and noncore assets. Even prior to the recent economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our addressable market was very large, at approximately €1.0 trillion. Over half of these assets still sit on bank balance sheets and will need to be sold in due course into the capital markets, where the largest investors are often distressed debt funds. See “Industry—Market participants” and “Industry—Alternative investment management—Market participants: fund and asset managers.” Although these assets are created continually, the rise in the level of NPLs is closely tied to periods of economic downturn. This trend was evident following the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008, where an extremely large number of NPLs were created. The economic dislocation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is already resulting in historically high bank provisioning for bad loans, which we expect will begin to be sold in significant volumes in the coming years. See “Industry—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic” Our current internal forecast, based on our analysis of bank provisions and forecast defaults, suggests to us that the economic impact of the ----- COVID-19 pandemic will lead to an increase of approximately 50% in our addressable market. This equates to approximately €500 billion of additional NPLs having been or being created on bank balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the non performing exposures (“NPE”) volume in EU banks (including the UK) decreased to €528 billion (compared to €584 billion in December 2019), with the year over year drop primarily driven by a significant increase in the support measures implemented to soften the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. NPL transaction activity was muted during 2020, marking a slowdown from previous years (total transaction activity of €77.8 billion, down 35% compared to 2019 and down 62% compared to 2018). We believe the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will increase transaction activity in 2021, which will in turn create new market opportunities. ECB 2020 stress tests suggest that NPLs levels could reach €1.4 trillion once COVID-19 related financial relief measures are withdrawn (as compared to a €1.2 trillion peak in 2015). See “ Industry—The European NPL _market.” Further, our presence within some of the largest European NPL jurisdictions, being Italy, UK, the Netherlands, Portugal and Ireland, puts us in a position to benefit from what we believe will be the greatest market prospect for non-performing assets since the global financial crisis in 2007/2008. The volume of NPLs in our primary markets is significant, as illustrated below: _Sources: Company information, ECB, EBA Risk Dashboard, Deloitte and KPMG market reports on European NPL market._ Prior to the current economic dislocation, European banks’ NPL ratios had only just begun to approach the levels targeted by the European Banking Authority (“EBA”) and the ECB. This had followed significant regulatory pressure for banks to recognize impaired assets and subsequently deleverage on an expedited basis. The result was a period of transformational European bank balance sheet restructuring that led to over €700 billion of assets being sold from bank balance sheets into the capital markets. We anticipate that the wave of new non-performing assets that is projected to be created following the current COVID-19-related economic dislocation will continue to mean that regulation is likely to prioritize bank deleveraging, resulting in another large wave of non-performing asset sales in the coming years. See “Industry—The impact of the _COVID-19 pandemic.” In addition to presenting investment opportunities, increased deleveraging_ by European banks is also expected to present significant asset servicing opportunities for our Asset Management and Servicing business, which we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of. See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—Specialization and _standardization.”_ The overall declining trend in total EU NPL volumes during 2020 has been driven by the relief measures adopted to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. ----- Over the period since the COVID-19 pandemic began, €900 billion of European loans received support through EBA-eligible moratoria. Our forward outlook is foreseen by the increase in Stage 2 loans (9.1% in December 2020 as compared to 6.5% in December 19). The proportion of Stage 2 loans under moratoria is 26.4%, emphasizing the potential downside risks once the moratoria expire. The chart below illustrates the large proportion of non-expired Stage 2 loans under moratoria. _Sources: EBA Risk Dashboard, KPMG Navigating European distressed markets - European debt sales 2021, Deloitte, Deleveraging Europe June 2021._ When government measures and moratoria come to an end, even a subset of these loans souring to NPL would cause banks to face a significant challenge, with a material rise in NPLs volumes, thereby creating market opportunities for new contract wins and investments. According to market consensus, the new flows will push banks to react with significant and prompt disposal processes, with the aim of remaining in line with their NPL maximum holding levels. According to PwC’s July 2021 report on the Italian NPL Market, up to €100 billion of distressed credits are expected to flow in the next 24-30 months in Italy alone, one of the largest NPL markets in Europe and one of our key markets. We are also highly active in the growing secondary market including purchasing NPLs and other non-core assets already serviced by our own platforms. Asset sales to NPL and other noncore asset buyers have grown dramatically in recent years in our key markets, suggesting a large secondary market. A typical non-performing asset portfolio has a long life, with cash collections often generated for over ten years. The majority of the over €700 billion of assets that have been sold by European banks in recent years have been purchased by large distressed asset funds. These asset funds are the largest buyers of non-performing assets in the market. Non-performing assets are typically held in a closed-end fund structure and then sold at the end of that fund’s life. Based on our analysis of previous transactions in the market, we estimate that an additional €300 billion of NPLs will be generated in the market over the next four years. A large number of these NPLs already sit on our servicing platforms, providing us with a unique pipeline of potential investment opportunities, the performance of which can be forecast with a degree of certainty. This greatly enhances risk-adjusted returns should we elect to purchase such assets, which we often do. Our significant estimated secondary sale market in our geographies is illustrated in the chart below. ----- _Sources: Company data; PwC, Deloitte and KPMG market reports on European NPLs market._ Fundraising from LP investors is also an important dynamic for our development and our offering is highly attractive to the growing number of LP investors looking to allocate to private debt. In fact, approximately 81% of the LP investors surveyed indicated that they expected to increase their allocation to alternative investments, including private debt strategies, to more than double the current levels over the next five years from 2% to 5%, according to a 2020 Preqin article regarding the future of alternatives in 2025. Our 2020 fundraise of the Fund represented one of the more successful fundraises of 2020, with the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally, third largest credit fundraise in special situations globally and fourth largest private equity fundraise in Europe. See “Industry—Alternative investment management.” The fundraising took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which created various operational issues, including, among others, that LP investors were unable to conduct in-person due diligence in respect of the Fund Manager. However, despite these unprecedented operational hurdles, we successfully facilitated interactions with over 100 LP investors throughout the Fund’s fundraising process and we believe that such interactions have led to the formation of a strong pipeline of potential LP investors for future fundraising. There is also an increasing propensity for banks and other debt originators to outsource their arrears or defaulted accounts collection activities which are not considered a core competency for them. See “See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—Specialization and _standardization.” However, collection activities remain a core competency for our Asset_ Management and Servicing business. This shift to outsourcing collection activities has increased given the COVID-19 pandemic and is an additional market development that we believe will be beneficial for our Asset Management and Servicing business. Throughout 2020, we secured a record 26 new contract wins, a further 11 new contracts in the first half of 2021 and we believe that we are well placed to win further new third-party contracts as a servicing partner to financial institutions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

We believe that ----- the following five factors have been critical in establishing our track record of delivering high IRR on our portfolio investments: - our people with significant experience and a deep bench of management experience; - local know-how of acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets; - strong origination capabilities with broad reach allowing us to acquire a high level of off-market deals; - leading data analytics capabilities, which enable us to underwrite portfolios with accuracy; and - experience in capital partnering where we have regularly partnered with third-party funds as a minority investor. Our track record has delivered a 17% Net Deal IRR since 2010 (despite the ERC write down as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic), including the track record of acquired businesses. Our performance by vintage year, shown in the chart below, has driven the results of our Balance Sheet business and also presents a compelling risk/return proposition for LP investors with consistent outperformance against relevant benchmarks, such as the high yield index, as illustrated below: _Source: Company information._ Our differentiated origination strategy targets high levels of off-market deals, leveraging off of our strong local presence and the ability to provide asset expertise on a granular basis. During 2020, based on our calculations, 74% of our total deals were acquired off-market, where deals tend to be smaller (€5 to €40 million investments) and typically deliver higher returns. Such opportunities are only generated from our deep market connections and experienced in-country NPL and non-core asset operational teams. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Portfolio investments.” The benefit of our differentiated origination strategy is_ illustrated by the chart below, showing an incremental 5% increase to the Net Deal IRR of ----- off-market deals (18% as of June 30, 2021) compared to on-market transactions (13% as of June 30, 2021) executed through competitive tender processes. Our track record was impacted by the ERC write down in the first half of 2020 with an overall 2% reduction in the average Net Deal IRR (all deals since 2010) from December 2019 to December 2020. However, the recovery is already underway, driven by the over-performance in actual collections against the ERC and the returns achieved on more recent vintages has already led to a 1% Net Deal IRR recovery. _Source: Company information and internal calculations._ Furthermore, we have strong actual cash realization, and therefore, we have demonstrable evidence that our actual cash collections performance is in line with our underwriting assumptions at the current point in time. As of June 30, 2020, we had realized above 100% of expected cash receipts, per our underwriting curves, in eight out of twelve years (i.e., 2010 to 2021). Our 2017 vintage had two large underperforming deals as a result of collection challenges caused by the counterparty’s bankruptcy and systems integration challenges and our 2018 and 2019 vintages have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in court closures and therefore impacted our ability to make cash collections. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” However, given the over-performance against_ the current forecast ERC, there is opportunity for recovery of these vintages over time. Notably, the 2020 and 2021 vintages show strong cash recovery of 230% and 296% respectively. The strong performance of our vintages is illustrated by the chart below. ----- _Source: Company information._ The Net Deal IRR of the 2020 vintage as of December 31, 2020 was 18%. Given the overperformance on actual collections together with reforecast ERC as of June 30, 2021, the Net Deal IRR for the 2021 vintage has increased to 21%. Given the economic uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain cautious and have adopted a conservative approach to our investment strategy and underwriting. As such, the 2021 vintage has been underwritten at a 16% Net Deal IRR. However, there is opportunity for the 2021 vintage to outperform, particularly given that actual collections to June 30, 2021 are 296% of the expected collections at underwriting for that period. Further, a smaller deal size ensures that our risks are well spread and of the over 1,000 deals with which we have been involved since 2010 to June 30, 2021, the investment loss on all deals that have not recovered cost is only 1.6% and 23% are forecast to make over 20% Net Deal IRR.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.88,Our Key Strengths,17.88.3,Integrated asset manager is a unique model not replicated by other market participants.,"Following the establishment of our Fund Manager and the raising of the Fund, we have transitioned to an integrated asset manager model, which we believe is unique in our market and enables our three businesses: the Fund and Investment Management, Asset Management and Servicing and Balance Sheet to operate synergistically. Our Fund and Investment Management business originates new investment opportunities, that our Balance Sheet business can co-invest into and our Asset Management and Servicing business can then service. We expect our Balance Sheet business to continue to co-invest alongside fund investments, with a participation of 25% for the Fund and a lower participation, approximately 10%, for subsequent funds. Our Asset Management and Servicing business currently services 71% of the Fund’s investments and the Fund pays market referenced fees for such services. The integrated asset manager model enables us to increase capital-light income, through management and performance fees generated by our Fund and Investment Management business and asset management and servicing fees delivered by our Asset Management and Servicing business. We believe that there are two fundamental benefits to our integrated asset manager model. Firstly, we can invest at scale and further build our considerable intellectual property of investing in our chosen markets and secondly, the increase in capital-light earnings will in due course fundamentally improve our financial profile. Investing at scale allows us to further build intellectual property through building origination capabilities through broadening and deepening relationships with Investment Portfolio Sellers and extending our reach to source off-market deals. In turn, the increased level of portfolios purchased enriches and builds our data and data analytical capabilities, leading to increased accuracy of underwriting and pricing portfolios. The increased scale is an enabler to create operational leverage within our platforms in our Asset Management and Servicing business, allowing returns to be maximized. Strong returns build our capital-light earnings, enable ----- deleveraging and increase the appetite from LP investors to commit financing to our subsequent funds, enabling the growth of our Fund Manager with the ability to further grow and increase the scale of our businesses. Furthermore, our integrated asset manager model drives an improved financial risk profile, given the increase in capital-light earnings generated. The increase in the level of capital-light revenues generated for each investment drives a materially different return on capital employed. The charts below show the indicative returns for a typical balance sheet investor with a Net Deal IRR of 18%, before any overhead allocation versus the indicative returns for us under our integrated asset manager model, showing the build of returns driven by the capital-light revenues, as well as the indicative returns, pre-overheads, for us of between 25% (based upon our current 25% co-investment participation) and 40% (based upon the expected approximately 10% coinvestment participation for subsequent funds). _Source: Company information._ We expect to be able to increase income generated through management and performance fees charged to LP investors while increasing scale benefits to the Asset Management and Servicing business through more increased and stable servicing income. We believe that the gradual build-up of management fees, primarily fees charged on drawn capital, will grow a stable revenue source with future funds. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our EBITDA from our capital-light businesses was 33% of our total EBITDA. Given the losses sustained during 2020, our capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA was negative 48.4%, but after adjusting for the non-cash write off of ERC in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic of £133.6 million, our capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA would have been 19.0%. Our capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA (pre-Acquisition costs) was 22.5% for the six months period ended June 30, 2021. The decrease since 2019 primarily reflects the investment in the fund management infrastructure, which will, in due course generate higher income as FUM continue to grow. We expect, but cannot guarantee, that the returns on capital, the build of capital-light revenues and the reduced level of purchases by our Balance Sheet business (we expect to reduce our co-investment participation in future funds, including ACO 2, to approximately 10% from the current 25%) will enable us to de-lever, reduce Net Debt and, in time, materially change our financial risk profile. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.88,Our Key Strengths,17.88.4,Differentiated origination capability supported by local platforms.,"Our Fund and Investment Management business has a differentiated approach from other institutional fund managers in the market. Based on our knowledge of the market, the majority of credit funds have a small team based in international capital centers and access the NPL and noncore asset market by mainly targeting large bank asset auctions of greater than €100 million. On the other hand, as highlighted in the chart below, our model is predicated on leveraging our large local presence in each of our markets, with local asset servicing businesses providing deep asset expertise on a granular basis, to form strong relationships with potential asset sellers and develop a detailed knowledge of a wide range of asset classes on a granular level. Our model has enabled us to consistently make more of our investments in non-competitive, off-market bi-lateral trades that are smaller in size and offer higher returns. _Note: Prepared based on Company information and estimates._ Our compelling proposition is highlighted by the Fund’s support from a diversified range of sophisticated LP investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth, university endowments and family offices, with global commitments ranging from the UK, Benelux, Nordics, Germany, Switzerland, the East Coast of the U.S., the West Coast of the U.S., Canada, Australia and Asia. Further, through our fundraising, we have had interactions with over 100 LP investors creating a very strong pipeline of potential investors for future fundraises. Furthermore, our Asset Management and Servicing business has market-leading platforms and is well placed to capitalize on growth opportunities. Our businesses undertake a broad range of services, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization and litigation and court process management, master servicing activities, such as legal title holding, securitization vehicle management activities and other activities such as due diligence, onboarding and new origination. We also provide debt collection and servicing to many of the large institutional global and European debt funds. See “—Our businesses—Asset Management and _Servicing business.” Our combination of market leading positions, niche dominant platforms and_ ----- competitive specialist servicing and investment platforms across five markets position us as a local operator with expertise in real estate, mortgage, SME and consumer NPL servicing. We achieved a record of 26 contract wins in 2020, with a further 11 new contract wins during the first half of 2021, one of which being our acquisition of the collections and recoveries operations within Tesco Bank’s Customer Service division. This partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced service to customers in financial difficulty by providing the necessary support and flexibility they will need in the future. Tesco Bank chose to partner with us because of our focus on customers, proven expertise, technology platform and the cultural alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The partnership is expected to result in over 200 of Tesco Bank’s personnel transferring over to us on November 1, 2021. We have observed an increasing need for our services from banks such as Tesco Bank given the pressure on their operations as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—Specialization and _standardization.” The increasing use of digital mediums, with portals for self-service by_ customers, increases in our customer satisfaction scores ― we have seen an increase by 0.3 in our customer satisfaction scores, averaging 7.7 (out of 9) in 2020 ― and embedded forbearance and vulnerable customer policies and processes have facilitated our growth and are a key factor in the industry awards that our platforms received in 2020. Our market-leading platforms deliver significant levels of third party contract wins which are backed up by the recognition we have received through awards and customer satisfaction. Most notably, in 2020 we were awarded the Credit Strategy ‘Best Outsourcing and Partnership’ Initiative for Onboarding and Customer Engagement, in recognition of our work with Virgin Money. Additionally, in November 2020 we became four time finalists after being nominated at the Credit Strategy Collections and Customer Service Awards. In Portugal, in 2020, our business was recognized not only as a Top Employer but accredited as the Best Credit Portfolio Management Company (Global Banking and Finance Review), Best Asset Management Servicer (International Investor) and Best Practice Operator of the Year (ACQ5, Country Awards 2020).",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, our Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation was £156.6 million and £90.7 million respectively. The build of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow is illustrated in the chart below. _Source: Company information._ ----- Furthermore, we retain flexibility on the level of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow that we reinvest in new portfolio acquisitions and, as such, are able to manage any peaks and troughs in liquidity requirements. This is evidenced by the fact that during 2020 the portfolio investments that we made amounted to £109.9 million, compared with £303.7 million during 2019, as we sought to conserve liquidity, given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we develop our capital-light businesses, we expect to reduce the level of re-investment in new portfolio acquisitions and, as such, we expect that a portion of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation will support Net Debt reduction and deleveraging. We are targeting £500 million Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation, after investment in new portfolios acquisitions for the period 2021–2025, which target we are not guaranteed to meet within the planned time frame or at all. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This _Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_ As exhibited in the chart below, our balance sheet has both geographical and asset class diversification.

This diversification, together with the limited deal size of any single portfolio investment, minimizes our risk profile. _Source: Company information._ Furthermore, as a result of the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our conservative non-cash write down of 13.2% to our ERC as of June 30, 2020, reflected the significant uncertainty at that time arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and is reflective of our cautious approach. Details of the ERC write-down are shown in the graphic below. ----- _Source: Company information._ However, as illustrated in the charts below, we are performing well against our ERC.

Their track-record of proven success places us in a position to expand upon our robust market position. The full support of our incumbent senior management and their strategic targets, increased capital-light earnings and reduced capital intensity, all increase our prospects of growth whilst also reducing leverage under the new ownership of TDR Capital. Our goal of reducing leverage will be bolstered by TDR ----- Capital’s commitment to reduce leverage (with a target of leverage being approximately 3.0 - 3.5 times by 2023) without compromising our existing risk appetite. TDR Capital is a leading specialist buyout firm with total FUM of approximately €10 billion as of December 31, 2020 and is based in the UK. It was founded in 2002 by Manjit Dale and Stephen Robertson, who were previously partners at DB Capital Partners. For further details, see “Principal Shareholders.” TDR Capital has an experienced team of investment professionals and operating partners and a longstanding historical focus on financial services and business services, as evidenced by its March 2016 investment in LeasePlan, the world’s leading fleet management and driver mobility company. TDR Capital has a low-volume investment strategy (one to two investments per year) based on principles developed by the investment team over the past decade. TDR Capital seeks to spend significant resources on each investment and to focus on operational excellence through a tested and integrated operating partner model. TDR Capital will provide operational best practices and fund management expertise accrued through almost 20 years of pan-European investing and understand the structures and culture required to enable our integrated asset manager model to thrive. TDR Capital has a strong track record in the financial services industry, including specialty finance, leasing and insurance. For example, TDR Capital helped oversee the growth of Lowell Group, a debt purchaser of unsecured debt, as its owner from 2011 until 2015, and developed an in-depth understanding of the value drivers and regulation relevant to the industry. TDR Capital has continued to actively monitor the credit management industry and has closely followed our journey in public markets to date, and believes that our team has successfully created a high quality, internationally diverse, vertically integrated asset manager and fully supports management’s clear ambition to further develop our capital-light based strategy.

Our focus on ESG is firmly embedded in our purpose and culture and we believe this focus will drive better operational outcomes. We recognize the importance of ESG for our stakeholders. The holders of the Notes, our shareholders and LP investors recognize the importance and value of investing in responsible businesses delivering sustainable returns. Our regulators require assurance over our policies, processes and practices and will act against firms that are non-compliant. Our customers expect to receive fair outcomes, whilst portfolio sellers and third-party asset management clients often require assurance that their customers will be handled responsibly and therefore, acting responsibly is increasingly becoming a competitive advantage. Also, our people want to work for a good corporate citizen. The primary focus of the social leg of our ESG strategy is ensuring fair customer treatment, which was particularly relevant throughout the COVID-19 pandemic where forbearance and vulnerable customer policies were critical in our support of our customers. Furthermore, we significantly curtailed litigation during the COVID-19 pandemic, as we believe that acting responsibly delivers better long term returns for all our stakeholders. In particular, our customer satisfaction levels rose during 2020, throughout such a difficult period for many of our customers. We expect to vertically re-align our governance by empowering our local champion platforms with local accountability under a fund manager framework. This framework will, we believe, deliver greater accountability and improve performance. Furthermore, we aim to maintain our commitment to diversity and inclusion among our people, in order to build a human-centric workplace and provide a positive work environment, supporting a diversity of working styles and appealing to a wider talent pool whilst retaining talented people who want autonomy and choice. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated our support for our people to help keep them safe with 100% of our staff fully operational and working from home by the end of March ----- 2020.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.90,Our History and Development,17.90.1,,"Arrow Global Guernsey Holdings Limited (“AGGHL”) was established on October 8, 2005, as the subsidiary of Arrow Global Financial Services (“AGFS”), a leading U.S. debt purchaser that was founded in 1961 as a debt collection agency (“DCA”). AGFS entered the debt purchase market in the 1990s and established and refined the model of placing accounts on a caseby-case basis with specialist agencies based on bespoke data handling and analytics. In 2004, AGFS was acquired by SLM Corporation (commonly known as Sallie Mae), a Fortune 500 financial services company, and in 2005, Zachary Lewy founded Arrow Global in the UK. In 2006, we formed a joint venture with RBS Equity Finance to purchase defaulted consumer debt portfolios in the UK, and in 2009, the Group was acquired as part of a leveraged buyout by the RBS Special Opportunities Fund. We grew to become a leading debt purchaser in the UK, and in 2009, we expanded our portfolio purchasing activities to Portugal, becoming one of the first foreign debt purchasers to purchase debt portfolios in that country. In October 2013, we successfully completed an IPO, securing a Premium Listing on the main market for listed securities and admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange, while raising net proceeds of £42 million to further support our portfolio purchase plan, which was contributed to us via a shareholder loan. The listing process also involved the establishment of a new board of directors with diverse business experience, enabling us to enhance and strengthen our business going forward. In November 2013, we were part of a consortium selected by the UK government following a competitive bidding process to purchase student loans owed by approximately a quarter of a million borrowers. Erudio Student Loans Limited took control of the portfolio of loans from the Student Loans Company Limited, and we made an initial investment of £11 million, with a commitment to make a further investment of £22 million. Following the expansion of our debt purchasing activities into Portugal, we started to acquire asset management and servicing platforms. In November 2014, we acquired Capquest Group Limited (“Capquest Group”), an established participant in the UK debt purchase and outsourced collections market that owned and serviced portfolios in the financial services, retail, telecommunications and motor finance sectors. Capquest Group had over 26 years of experience in the debt collection industry, and operated in the UK with a primary focus on non-performing and semi-performing unsecured consumer loans. Capquest Group developed extensive debt purchasing capabilities and had grown to become one of the largest privately-owned purchasers of non-performing consumer debt in the UK (based on 120-Month ERC), partnering with a diverse client base and holding positions on numerous debt purchaser and DCA panels. The acquisition enabled us to service certain portfolios that we acquired in the UK. See “—Our businesses—Asset _Management and Servicing business.”_ ----- In April 2015, we acquired 33% of the shares of Silver Parallel S.A. (the parent company of Whitestar Asset Solutions, SA (“Whitestar”), a leading Portuguese servicer of secured and unsecured loans), from CarVal Investors for a total consideration of €49.8 million payable over two years, but we received full voting control and a 100% economic interest in Whitestar at that time. In April 2016, we acquired a further 42% of the shares of Whitestar, increasing our total shareholding to 75%. In April 2017, we acquired the remaining 25% of the shares of Whitestar for a purchase price of €10.6 million. As part of this transaction, we also entered into a strategic partnership with CarVal Investors to jointly originate Portuguese investments and provided a formal five-year servicing commitment for CarVal Investors’ Portuguese originated Portfolio Assets to be serviced by Whitestar. Additionally, we acquired Gesphone, a Portuguese servicer of non-performing loans and owner of €77.2 million face value worth of portfolios, for a consideration of €8.1 million. The acquisition was in line with our strategic goal of developing origination and servicing capabilities outside of the UK. See “—Our businesses—Asset _Management and Servicing business.”_ With our previous acquisitions building up our asset management and servicing capabilities within the UK and Portugal, we expanded geographically with an acquisition in the Netherlands. In May 2016, we acquired InVesting B.V. (“Vesting Group”). This acquisition added approximately 502,000 customer accounts with a face value of €663 million as of December 31, 2015 and contributed to the diversification of the income streams of our business and our origination capabilities. Vesting Group is a traditional DCA and pension service provider with long duration customer relationships. Vesting Group also provides customer information to minimize credit and payment risks for businesses. See “—Our businesses—Asset Management _and Servicing business.”_ In line with our geographical expansion strategy, in April 2017 we acquired the Zenith Service S.p.A. (“Zenith”) in Italy. Zenith is a servicing business focused on the Italian structured finance market and continues to contribute to the diversification of the income streams of our business and our origination capabilities. See “—Our businesses—Asset Management and _Servicing business.”_ In November 2017, we acquired Mars Capital Finance Limited and Mars Capital Finance Ireland (together, “Mars Capital”), a mortgage servicing business with operations in the UK and Ireland. Mars Capital provides servicing for mortgages covering first and second lien residential, buy-to-let and SME commercial mortgages, and provides full loan lifecycle servicing, from loan origination support to late stage recoveries and real estate sales, with particular focus on managing distressed mortgages. Mars Capital has securitization origination, issuing and servicing expertise, is rated as a primary and special servicer in the UK by Fitch Ratings, and is regulated by the FCA. Mars Capital Ireland is regulated in Ireland by the CBI as a credit servicing firm under Part V of the CBA 1997 (as amended by the Irish CSA) and has acted as a credit servicer in respect of more than €1 billion worth of Irish mortgage assets. See “—Our businesses—Asset Management and _Servicing business.”_ On March 1, 2018, we acquired Parr Credit S.r.l (“Parr”), an Italian servicing business for unsecured performing and non-performing loans and customer relationship management for banks and telecommunications companies. Parr also owns 20% of the equity in Parr Sh.p.k, which acts as Parr’s offshore servicing center in Tirana, Albania. In 2017, Parr generated revenues of €17.5 ----- million (in Italian GAAP) and had approximately 200 employees. We paid a total consideration amount of €20 million for the acquisition of Parr, €15 million of which was paid upon completion. See “—Our businesses—Asset Management and Servicing business.” In March 2018, we acquired Europa Investimenti, a leading originator and manager of Italian distressed debt investments. Europa Investimenti invests in Italian companies through the Italian court-administered administration and bankruptcy process, acquiring both assets and NPLs related to distressed companies. From its inception in 2008 to 2017, it had completed 63 transactions. As of June 30, 2017, Europa Investimenti had gross assets of €63.2 million, with revenues of €23.6 million and €9.8 million profit before tax for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017. On July 26, 2018, we acquired 100% ownership of Norfin, a leading manager of real estate investments in Portugal. This acquisition strengthened our asset management and investment capabilities, is highly complementary to our existing Whitestar platform, and allows us to offer a comprehensive set of servicing solutions to investors in Portugal. On April 8, 2019, we acquired 100% ownership of Drydens Limited, operating as Drydensfairfax Solicitors (“Drydensfairfax”), a provider of legal services. This acquisition broadened our UK range of servicing capabilities and skills across consumer and commercial litigation, probate and insolvency. The total undiscounted consideration for the acquisition was £11.1 million, including deferred and contingent consideration. See “—Our businesses—Asset _Management and Servicing business.”_ Following our expansion from a UK unsecured debt purchaser to a multi-asset class and multi-geographical debt purchaser and servicer with small fund management operations, we had the necessary capabilities to build fund management infrastructure. In December 2019, we launched our first discretionary closed-end fund, a pan-European non-performing loan fund, with €836.8 million in total commitments, including €628.5 million subscribed by third-party LP investors. In November 2020, we announced final close of the fundraising for the Fund, with total capital commitments of €1.7 billion, including our investment. We expect that the Fund will invest in selective European credit opportunities sourced through our Fund and Investment Management business, leveraging the Group’s entire pan-European expertise to offer investors attractive access to specialist and high-return asset classes. We will earn management fees through the Fund Manager. The capital commitment comprises multiple investment vehicles, including a fund and a co-investment program. See “—Our businesses—Fund and Investment Management business.” On March 31, 2021, we announced the Board’s agreement to the terms and conditions of a recommended all cash offer of 307.5 pence for each ordinary share of AGG by Bidco, a newly formed company owned by certain of the investment funds managed by TDR Capital. The price per ordinary share represented a premium of approximately 33.4% to the closing price of 230.5 pence per ordinary share on February 5, 2021 (being the last Business Day before the commencement of the offer period) and 46.6% to the volume-weighted average price of 209.7 pence per ordinary share for the one-month period ended February 5, 2021 (being the last Business Day before the commencement of the offer period).

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.91,Our businesses,17.91.1,Fund and Investment Management business,"This business comprises the fund and investment manager, the Fund Manager, responsible for managing the Fund, alongside our existing businesses Norfin, Europa Investimenti and Sagitta. The development in 2019 and 2020 of the Fund Manager has been central to the success in raising the Fund, with total capital commitments of €1.7 billion, including our investment. Despite clear market and operational challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we received strong support from some of the largest and most sophisticated global investors from diverse sectors and geographies, including the UK, Benelux, the Nordics, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, the East Coast of the U.S., the West Coast of the U.S., Canada, Australia and Asia. See “—Our Key Strengths— ----- _Differentiated origination capability supported by local platforms.” With a final close of €1.7_ billion in November 2020, the Fund received commitments from a broad range of investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, university endowments and family offices with an average commitment of approximately €80 million. We expect that the Fund will invest in selective European credit opportunities, leveraging the Group’s entire panEuropean expertise to offer investors attractive access to specialist and high-return asset classes. LP investors in the Fund pay the Fund Manager fees predominantly based on drawn capital with a small amount paid on committed capital. In addition, LP investors incentivize the Fund Manager through performance fees. We participate in this performance fee regime with a 30% to 40% share, which represents an important and potentially material income stream to the Fund and Investment Management business. In addition to the management and performance fees that we collect, we charge investors “designated charges,” which enables attributable costs to be re-charged to the Fund and future funds. The development of the Fund Manager and the fundraising of the Fund have enabled the full transition to our capital-light integrated asset manager model. The Fund represented the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally in 2020, the third largest credit fundraise in special situations globally in 2020 and the fourth largest private credit fundraise in Europe. Set out below are the fundamental reasons that we believe resulted in the success of our fundraising from LP investors: _1._ _Our people_ Our Fund and Investment Management business has an experienced team of professionals with a demonstrable track record of investing in these asset classes across the geographies in which we operate. This team collectively represents over 50 years and in excess of 1,000 deals of credit investment experience and portfolio management experience in transactions of the type that are within the Fund’s investment program. The team is led by Zachary Lewy, our co-founder who has over 15 years of industry experience and who is Principal and CEO of the Fund and Investment Management business. _2._ _Our track record_ We, and our investment team in particular, have a demonstrable track record of investing across the NPL and non-core asset classes within the geographies in which we operate and have achieved both strong and stable returns over a significant period of time. The chart below shows the IRR returns we have generated from our portfolio investments since 2010 as compared with the returns from the euro high yield bond market: _Source: Company information._ ----- _3._ _Our local presence to deliver a differentiated investment strategy_ We believe that our servicing platforms are well-placed to maintain their leading position in the industry, and our Fund and Investment Management business benefits from the unique capabilities of these platforms to stand at the center of opportunity flows for the most attractive segments of European credit investing in the non-core and NPL segments. This unique position has been established as a result of the work, reputation and experience of our professional teams, both with respect to the deployment of capital into such opportunities and also defining, maximizing and operationalizing collections strategies tailored to portfolios. The reliance that many pre-eminent credit investor groups place on platforms such as ours for purposes of portfoliolevel advice, collections and other services, and the relationship-based nature of the EU credit markets, are indicative that our platforms are well-positioned to retain this advantageous position within the market. The European debt purchase and servicing market has a number of key attributes, such as the importance of trusted relationships and the value of scale and dependence on data excellence, each of which is required to be successful in the long term. We have a proven track record of strong and trusted relationships with debt sellers, which is critical to our being invited to participate in portfolio sale processes on an ongoing basis, including negotiated transactions where the terms are agreed on a bilateral basis outside of an auction process. We demonstrated our origination capabilities at the time of fundraising for the Fund as 78% of the transactions executed in 2018 were acquired through bilateral off-market investment opportunities and over 75% were from repeat transaction sources. This reputation and compliance track record are critical factors for debt sellers, who tend to only work with trusted partners who meet both of these stringent requirements and have exhibited the ability to execute transactions in a timely manner. We believe there has been a trend among some large debt sellers towards consolidation around a few trusted leading debt purchasers with the attributes of scale and a commitment to compliance. This has led to a general reduction in the size of debt sellers’ panels as debt sellers favor stronger, longer-lasting relationships with fewer participants. In addition, we have built strong working relationships with credit funds, which have become a key part of our origination strategy. In view of the important roles played by the various components of our platform in attracting and retaining clients, pricing deals with precision, and developing tailored collections strategies for a wide range of different types of portfolios, we believe that the dynamics of market leadership in European debt markets have changed. In the past, experience in collections, together with capital participation alongside investors, formed the basis of a good foundation for a central role in European NPL and non-core asset markets. Those attributes alone, however, are no longer sufficient for pre-eminence in sourcing and servicing in the most attractive aspects of NPL and non-core asset markets. We believe that incumbency advantage and recognition, borne out of a consistent market presence, is often increasingly important. In addition, deep data analytical capacities and compliance and regulatory expertise are increasingly critical to defining the most successful strategies for sourcing, pricing, collection and exit in NPL and non-core asset markets. In particular, we believe that our deep, country-specific ----- understanding of the regulatory environments in the markets of our platforms and our status within those markets are critical features of our success. For example, in some of the geographies in which we operate, in addition to the FCA and other regulatory bodies’ standards, debt purchasers must also meet the compliance standards of individual debt sellers (as well as satisfy rating agency and securitization market norms) to be considered in debt sale processes. In some of the geographies in which we operate, debt purchasers are generally required to obtain a license before being able to acquire debt. In order to enhance the stature and functionality of our platform, since 2014, we have acquired leading servicing and investment platforms holding a range of relevant prerequisite authorizations that enable the platform to successfully source, underwrite and service loan portfolios. _4._ _Experience in Capital Partnering_ Historically, we have been able to offer market participants not only servicing functions but also act as a capital participant alongside investors who are our clients. For example, in larger portfolio transactions initiated by debt sellers, we have routinely acted as a capital investor alongside credit fund purchasers of portfolios and, in such cases, have regularly taken a minority capital stake alongside such credit funds to align interests in transactions involving our platform for servicing and collections on the underlying loans. Subsequently, as the portfolio is duly collected, it is often the case that we become the natural buyer of the remaining portfolio “tail” or “stub” piece when the credit fund in question seeks an exit or finds it uneconomic to continue overseeing the remaining, relatively small portfolio. At various points in time, we have partnered with leading third-party private equity investors who have invested €3.4 billion of capital alongside us from 2014 through 2018. _5._ _A Focus on Data Analyses_ The deep portfolio expertise that attracts debt investors to our platforms is rooted in the knowledge and information management capacities of the platforms that support the collection, organizing and retention of high-quality data on portfolios in connection with investment and collections activity. In particular, data excellence through our platform’s use of high-quality data and analytical models is critical to pricing portfolio purchasing in a precise manner, improving collection performance and operating the collections and borrower interface functions in keeping with applicable compliance standards. Our other businesses within Fund and Investment Management are Europa Investimenti, Sagitta and Norfin. Europa Investimenti, acquired in 2018, is a leading operator in distressed and special situation investments in the Italian market. Europa Investimenti specializes in debt opportunities relating to small and medium-sized enterprise and real estate assets. Europa Investimenti is the 95.64% owner of Sagitta SGR, S.p.A., a fund manager regulated by the Bank of Italy. Norfin, acquired in 2018, is a prominent real estate fund manager that has been operating for 22 years in Portugal and manages approximately €1.6 billion in both regulated and nonregulated assets. Its activity intersects the entire spectrum of the Portuguese real estate market as it manages direct real estate investments with different risk profiles (i.e., the management of portfolios that include offices, residential units, logistics, retail and tourism operations facilities, in addition to project development ranging from the acquisition phase up to the design, construction and commercialization phase). ----- In addition, the Balance Sheet business pays an intra-segmental charge to the Fund and Investment Management business for portfolio management services relating to the assets held on our back-book assets at a rate of 150bps on net asset value and for Arrow SMA, based on a rate of 175bps during 2020 and 150bps from January 1, 2021 on drawn capital during the investment period. The total blended fee rate for Fund and Investment Management during 2020 was 0.9% of funds under management. The Fund and Investment Management business had a total FUM of €4.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 (€4.3 billion as of December 31, 2020), and we aim to raise a new “flagship” fund approximately every two years. Our target is to grow our FUM to over €10.0 billion by the end of 2025 with a goal of achieving 40% EBITDA Margin. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum includes _forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.” To ensure that we are able to achieve the required scalability, several critical hires_ have joined the business in line with our plans to strengthening our team. Organizational design and process improvements have been established with governance, leadership and clarity of responsibility formalized along with progress in management oversight. Furthermore, during the first half of 2021, we continued to deliver process and operational improvements in line with our targets and this trend is expected to continue, further enhancing our Fund and Investment Management business. Ongoing focus on enhancing risk management practices into the Fund and embedding daily risk management and other operations also continued in 2021. For example, we have recently formed the Clients and Capital Formation Group within the Fund and Investment Management business and recruited Mr. Kamran Anwar to lead this team. Mr. Anwar brings a wealth of experience in financial services, having spent 23 years at Citigroup in leadership roles across the Middle East, Europe and Asia, covering M&A, transaction banking, private equity, real estate and corporate strategy. Most recently, Mr. Anwar spent five years in the technology industry, where he worked with SS&C Technologies leading their private equity services franchise in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The Clients and Capital Formation Group will partner with our clients to provide differentiated investment solutions and world-class insights from our core areas of expertise in European non-performing and non-core debt. We will seek to broaden the LP set by enabling global capital pools to access the opportunities presented by the European NPL market through our Fund Manager. Furthermore, we expect that the acquisition of our business by TDR Capital will further enhance our access to LP investors. TDR Capital will provide operational best practices and fund management expertise accrued through almost 20 years of pan-European investing experience and its understanding of the structures and culture required to enable the fund management model to thrive.

These platforms service and manage debt collection and other activities related to portfolio investments and enable us to service multiple asset classes across multiple geographies. The development of strategies that maximize collections performance, whilst simultaneously enhancing operational efficiency and maintaining adherence to regulations, is key to the platform’s performance. ----- Our Asset Management and Servicing business performs a broad range of services, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization, legal title holding, due diligence activities, initial platform migration and on-boarding activities, master servicing, securitization vehicle set-up and ongoing management activities, new origination activities, litigation and court process management and third-party sub-servicer management. Our Asset Management and Servicing platforms are well-equipped for growth and generated revenues of £125.4 million during the year 2020. Furthermore, an analysis of the fees generated during the year 2020 from the various aforementioned activities is shown in the chart below: The following graphic summarizes the services provided by our platforms across different asset classes and geographies: _Source: Company information._ As of December 31, 2020, our AUM was approximately £65 billion, apportioned in the jurisdictions in which we operate as follows: UK and Ireland (three platforms with approximately ----- £15 billion AUM), the Netherlands (three platforms with approximately £5 billion AUM), Italy (three platforms with approximately £35 billion AUM) and Portugal (two platforms with approximately £10 billion AUM). Further details of our platforms that have grown organically, as well as through acquisition, are as follows: _United Kingdom and Ireland_ Mars Capital: Mars Capital Finance Limited and Mars Capital Finance Ireland, respectively a UK credit servicing company and an Irish-registered company, specialize in servicing solutions for residential buy-to-let and small- and medium-sized enterprise commercial mortgages. Mars Capital operates in the UK and Ireland and each entity is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Mars Capital in 2017. Capquest Group: Capquest Group is a leading credit servicing company operating in the UK. Capquest Group specializes in consumer assets and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Capquest Group in 2014. Bergen: Bergen Capital Management Limited (“Bergen”) is a prominent UK commercial real estate (“CRE”) loan servicer that is active as a sourcing channel for loan investment opportunities. Bergen is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Bergen in 2018. Drydensfairfax: Drydensfairfax is one of the largest UK law firms focused on the recovery of debt and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Drydensfairfax in 2019. Drydensfairfax operates under the auspices of applicable professional independence requirements in providing leading debt recovery services. _Italy_ Parr: Parr is a market-leading credit servicing company operating in Italy. Parr specializes in consumer and mortgage assets and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Parr in 2018. In 2019, Parr changed its name to “Whitestar S.r.l.” and is currently trading as Whitestar Asset Solutions. Zenith: Zenith is a prominent credit servicing company operating in Italy. Zenith specializes in master servicing and securitization services and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Zenith in 2017. _Portugal_ Whitestar: Whitestar is an established credit servicing company operating in Portugal. Whitestar specializes in consumer, small- and medium-sized enterprise and real estate assets and manages Hefesto STC, SA, a regulated securitization vehicle. Whitestar and Hefesto STC, SA are wholly-owned subsidiaries of AGG. Whitestar was acquired by AGG in 2015 and Hefesto STC, SA was acquired by AGG in 2017. In addition to Whitestar and Hefesto STC, SA, AGG acquired local servicer Gesphone - Serviços De Tratamento E Aquisição De Dívidas, S.A (“Gesphone”) on April 1, 2015, and Effico (Effico – Gestão de Clientes e Recuperação de Activos, S.A.) on April 29, 2013, both of which have since been consolidated into Whitestar. On July 15, 2013, AGG ----- acquired the assets of GE Money Servicing Ltd and transferred the platform and its staff to Whitestar. _The Netherlands_ Vesting Group: Vesting Group is an established credit servicing company operating in the Netherlands. Vesting Group specializes in consumer assets and credit bureau services and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Vesting in 2016. Through the abovementioned platforms, we have access to an expansive historical data set across approximately 10 million accounts belonging to borrowers across the geographies in which we operate. The revenue of our Asset Management and Servicing business was £64.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Revenues for this business were £125.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 against £128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, demonstrating the resilience of this capital-light income stream through a significant economic downturn. Throughout 2020, we secured a record 26 new contract wins. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, we secured 11 new contracts. On August 17, 2021, we announced plans to acquire the collections and recoveries operations within Tesco Bank’s Customer Service division. This partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced service to customers in financial difficulty by providing the necessary support and flexibility they will need in the future, with Tesco Bank choosing to partner with us, given our customer focus, proven expertise, technology platform and the cultural alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The partnership is expected to result in our taking on over 200 Tesco Bank personnel on November 1, 2021. We believe that we are well placed to win further new third-party contracts as a servicing partner for financial institutions that require additional collections capacity given the growing non-performing loan volumes resulting from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are also significant opportunities for the Asset Management and Servicing business created by the Fund. It is estimated that approximately 65% of the Fund’s purchases will be serviced on our platforms and the Fund will pay the Asset Management and Servicing business market referenced fees for such servicing. Furthermore, profitability for the business is expected to steadily increase as we continue to develop our operational efficiency. We aspire to a target Asset Management and Servicing EBITDA Margin of 25% by 2025 from EBITDA Margins of 12.4% and 17.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will achieve such targets within the targeted time frames or at all.

Prior to the deployment of the Fund in 2020, we invested our own capital, sometimes co-investing with partners, to generate returns. Since the deployment of the Fund, we have typically co-invested 25% alongside the Fund’s 75% investment, although the level of co-investment by the Balance Sheet business may reduce for future successor ----- funds. Please see “Business—Our Key Strategies—Highly cash flow generative with conservative _risk management and strong balance sheet.” for a high-level overview of our 84-Month ERC by_ asset type and geography as of June 30, 2021. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cash Collections were impacted, particularly in the second quarter of 2020, predominantly due to court closures, real estate market closures, various moratoriums on certain legal and enforcement activities and temporary interruptions to customers’ earnings across all of our core markets. We took a conservative view about the wider economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and, as a result, revalued the ERC balance sheet asset at the half-year mark of 2020, resulting in a non-cash impairment of portfolio investments of £133.6 million. Cash Collections have performed strongly against these revised estimates, collecting 125% of reforecast ERC in the second half of 2020 and by 119% in the first half of 2021. We remain cautious (investing in portfolios with typically a shorter weighted average life, more granular assets and secured portfolios) and we anticipate that there is a reasonable possibility of a deterioration in the economic outlook in late 2021 and beyond, as government financial aid provided throughout the pandemic begins to recede and the various moratoria are lifted. As such, there has been no material write-down of the ERC in 2021 and as of June 30, 2021, the non-cash write-up of the ERC was £17.7 million. In addition, we proactively managed cash as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and took decisive action to reduce capital deployment. We saw a slowdown in the market, predominantly driven by financial institutions taking a prudent approach to valuations and banks focusing on initial provisioning over asset sales in the first six months of 2020. Full-year portfolio purchases in 2020 were £109.9 million, compared with £303.7 million in 2019. Since January 2020, our Balance Sheet business has typically co-invested 25% of the total portfolio investment alongside the Fund through a 100% owned Jersey partnership, Arrow SMA, with the expectation of approximately £200 million balance sheet purchases being invested by the Fund annually. We expect the co-investment percentage to reduce over time and for our balance sheet investments by future funds to amount to approximately £100 million per annum in the medium term. We hold investment committees in respect of all deals and have carve-outs to support policy requirements, thereby maintaining strong control over liquidity risk. The co-invest model requires lower balance sheet investment volumes than historic levels, likely leading to a faster de-leveraging profile and absolute Net Debt reduction. In addition, we anticipate that the coinvest structure with the Fund will simplify our accounting profile. As assets purchased through the fund co-invest structure increase, the proportion of income accounted for on a fair value basis through Arrow SMA will increase, and the share of portfolios accounted for on an amortized cost basis will decline. Furthermore, the ERC on our new co-investments alongside the Fund are calculated using collections net of asset management, servicing and collection fees that are incurred within fund special purpose vehicles. Historically, the ERC was calculated using gross collections.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Investment levels are forecast as part of our budget process to ensure that leverage and liquidity expectations are in line with targets and appetite levels. As of June 30, 2021, ----- our Secured Net Debt position was £1,154 million (£1,181 million as of December 31, 2020) and leverage was 4.7 times (5.1 times as of December 31, 2020). Our Adjusted Free Cash Flow was £90.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 (£156.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020). Our increased focus on reducing capital intensity and growing earnings from our capital-light businesses are expected to yield significant levels of cash generation. Our target is to generate £500 million in cash after portfolio investments, during financial years 2021 to 2025 and we believe that this cash generation will enable deleveraging. We are targeting our leverage to reach 4.0 times (before incurring costs of approximately £85 million in connection with the Acquisition) by the end of 2021, and to be within our target range of approximately 3.0-3.5 times by 2023. These targets are indicative only and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve such targets within the planned time frame or at all.

We refer to our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses as our capital-light businesses, given the limited level of capital required to operate those businesses. We believe that this capital-light model is unique (our competitors employ a more capital-intensive model) and yields a number of benefits, including the following: 1. We typically co-invest capital alongside third-party capital managed by the Fund and Investment Management business at a ratio of 25:75 (i.e., we co-invest 25% while the Fund invests 75%), with approximately 71% of portfolios managed and serviced by an Arrow platform within our Asset Management and Servicing business. The capitallight revenues generated from fund and performance management fees, as well as the portfolio asset management and servicing fees, result in an indicative return on capital invested of approximately 25%. For a similar investment, the indicative return for a balance sheet investor with no servicing capability would be 18%. We aim to reduce the ratio of our co-investment in future funds managed by the Fund Manager to a target ratio of 10:90. This would further boost the indicative return on capital from 25% to approximately 40%. See “—Our Key Strengths—Integrated asset manager is a unique _model not replicated by other market participants;”_ 2. The model is fundamental to our target of generating at least 50% of EBITDA from our capital-light businesses in the medium term, enabling us to de-lever and reduce the level of gross and Net Debt on our balance sheet and grow earnings without increasing the level of our debt and/or our balance sheet; and 3. We are able to grow and develop asset management and servicing revenues, enrich the levels of customer data and build origination capabilities utilizing third-party capital.

The graphic below details our annual cost base on a granular level. _Source: Company information._ As we have expanded into new markets and built our servicing capability, we have invested in centralized functions as part of the One Arrow program – an implementation plan that we set in place in order to obtain the horizontal alignment of our business across its different locations and jurisdictions. Since the Target’s IPO in 2013, the Target’s pre-exceptional cost income ratio has moved from being less than 50% to greater than 65%. The graphic below charts our cost to income ratio from 2017 onwards.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.92,Cost Structure Development and Cost Saving Opportunities,17.92.2,Costs Savings,"For the year ended December 31, 2020, our total operating cost base amounted to £225 million. Based on TDR Capital’s and management’s estimates (as well as the strategic review which we expect to undertake during the course of 2022), we are targeting annualized cost savings of £20 million, to be derived as detailed below. 1. The transition of the Target from a public company to a private company has brought about a number of significant changes to the Target Group, including the removal of the Target’s public company board of directors together with a reduction of professional costs, the eradication of the former long term management incentive and share incentive schemes and the reduction in spending on investor relation activities, among others. We believe that we will see cost savings in the amount of approximately £6 million as a result of the privatization of the Target. 2. Going forward, we believe that there are areas of centralization to retain, but that certain other functions may be better and more efficiently delivered with local accountability. As such, we plan to vertically align our local platforms and the corresponding local investment strategies under a fund management framework, allowing us to maintain central origination and underwriting functions, supported by local expertise. In turn, this will lead to the empowerment of our local platforms and enhance the accountability of the business leaders of our local platforms. Our focus is on creating a cost-ownership culture which engenders accountability and delivers efficiencies without creating duallayer costs. Our transition to operating under the vertically aligned model is expected to bring about cost savings of approximately £6 million. ----- 3. As a result of the increased accountability, we expect further annualized cost savings of approximately £8 million, which are initially targeted to be delivered over the course of 2022. We expect the majority of these savings to be delivered through platform efficiencies, operational leverage and increased accountability. Furthermore, TDR Capital’s experience with financial services and business services, together with its fund management expertise, will allow us to leverage TDR Capital’s operational best practices and lead to greater accountability for the business leaders in our local operations. See “— _Our Key Strengths—Current strategic plan enhanced by TDR Capital ownership.”_ Overall, we anticipate that the savings that could stem from the implementation of greater efficiency in our operations is approximately £8 million by the end of 2022. An independent third-party advisor estimates total cost savings of between £17 and 32 million, with £9 to £20 million overhead cost reductions and £8 to £13 million in direct cost reductions. This compares with the management’s target savings of £20 million as outlined above. The independent third-party advisor also estimates one-off costs ranging from £10 million to £20 million in order to realize such cost savings. However, there can be no assurance that any such cost savings and efficiencies will be achieved in time or at all or that we will not incur additional costs to realize such cost savings.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.93,Our investment process and operations,17.93.1,,"We acquire portfolios through the Balance Sheet business and on behalf of ourselves and third parties through the Fund and Investment Management business in the UK, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and the Netherlands. Portfolios are acquired through a number of sales processes detailed below: - _Auctions. A panel of investors or debt purchasers are invited to submit bids for portfolios. An auction process can take many forms, including sealed bids or more competitive online procedures, and can be facilitated by an adviser, a broker or the debt seller’s management team; - _Bilateral sale. Debt sellers engage in discussions with one selected party and negotiate the sale. In these transactions, debt sellers target investors with particular competencies or deal execution capabilities to take on a given portfolio; - _In-situ sale. The sale of portfolios is accompanied by a legally binding obligation that such portfolios, which are then serviced by particular third parties, remain with those third parties for a certain period of time post-acquisition. In-situ sales can be either bilateral or auction-based. As our platform has the capability of functioning as both debt servicer and purchaser, in-situ sales have historically included purchasing smaller run-off portfolios (sometimes referred to as “portfolio tails”) from banks or credit funds ----- that have placed the servicing/collections activity for those loan portfolios on our Fund and Investment Management platform; and/or - _Secondary sale. The sale of loan portfolios from one debt purchaser to another either after a limited period of trial collections activity to establish value or after dividing a portfolio into smaller pieces or at the end of a credit fund life. Secondary sales generate additional liquidity for such debt sellers by facilitating the release of capital earlier and providing debt originators with a platform to sell increasingly larger portfolios to wellfunded players that can then sell on to smaller debt purchasers, parts of the portfolios that are less in line with their investment strategy and better suited for specialist collection activity. We have a strong origination function that is able to source a significant portion of our investments “off-market” that are outside the competitive auction process. During 2020, 74% of portfolio investments made by the Balance Sheet business were purchased off-market. In addition to the differing types of purchases, we purchase across a broad range of sectors and markets as follows: - _Financial services. The financial services sector is the largest originator of defaulted debts by value and typically has the highest appetite to use debt sale as a recovery mechanism, making it the largest segment in the debt purchasing market. See “Industry—The European NPL market.” This market segment is highly diversified by type, age and quality of debt and debt seller. Debt sales in this sector mostly comprise balances outstanding on credit cards, personal loans (including private sector student loans), overdrafts, affinity cards, residential and SME mortgage loans and shortfalls, and long-term retail debt receivables that have been originated by banks and credit card companies, as well as small business credit. In addition, banks sell specialty real estate loans, bankruptcy claims, structured credit and other credit in real estate receivables; - _Special_ _Situations._ Particular, non-programmatic event-driven investment opportunities have formed an important part of our business through events impacting counterparties, sellers and other institutions within the credit market that generate, or themselves constitute, attractive investment opportunities; - _Litigation Related, Bankruptcy & Distress. Assets acquired through court and bankruptcy proceedings (such as through the Italian Concordato procedure), utilizing our extensive knowledge of bankruptcy processes, provide for attractive investment opportunities; - _Real Estate. The real estate sector across the geographies in which we operate offers a wide array of attractive investment opportunities ranging from mortgages and direct real estate investments to real estate-backed assets; - _Structured Credit. A variety of structured credit products that continue to be offered by debt sellers account for a diverse range of attractive investment opportunities and assets; ----- - _Telecommunications_ _and_ _Utilities._ Led by mobile phone companies, telecommunication firms have increasingly looked to debt sale to recover unpaid bills. Debt sales in this sector mostly comprise balances outstanding on unpaid mobile phone bills or mobile phone contracts set up to provide a discount on a mobile device that were terminated prior to their agreed maturity. Typically, telecommunications loan portfolios have lower balances than debt in other sectors and are sold at the primary and secondary stages. Similar attributes apply to a broad range of utilities; - _Retail. Charge-offs resulting from short-term credit offered by catalogue, phone or online shopping companies as part of their sales growth strategy are generally sold at an early stage, usually before being placed with a DCA and thus often resulting in higher value debt portfolios; and - _Government. Assets acquired through the rescue/nationalization of banks in the UK (managed by UK Asset Resolution) and Ireland (managed by The National Asset Management Agency) as a result of the global financial crises and ongoing stresses of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis continue to be unwound through programmatic auction processes. We follow a disciplined, systematic investment evaluation process for investments, which utilizes expertise from different areas of the business and extensive historic data. This approach has enabled us to consistently deliver good returns as demonstrated by our performance track record. There are multiple stages to the evaluation process, typically including most of the components or stages below: _Origination_ We have a dedicated origination team that, with the assistance of local on the ground personnel across the various platforms, has access to a wide range of relationships and sources of potential investment opportunities including: - _Direct Relationships. We have a wide network of direct contacts with loan portfolio owners across the geographies in which we operate, and we leverage their relationships to identify investment opportunities. The relationship network includes:  third-party private investment funds and their managers and investment teams that are seeking to dispose of or otherwise exit the positions held by their investment fund entities at entity lifecycle end;  sellers from whom we have previously purchased loan portfolios;  entities that are clients of our market-leading loan servicing business;  banks and other financial institutions that seek to do business or trade with a party that “speaks their language;” and  investment banks seeking a sophisticated investor or trade counterparty. ----- - _Intermediaries. We have a wide network of contacts with intermediaries that are active in the loan portfolio transactional market across the geographies in which we operate. This relationship network includes a range of intermediaries employed by prospective debt sellers of loan portfolios to run a competitive portfolio sale process, as well as long-established relationships with the “Big 4” accounting firms. _Screening_ Our investment team typically conducts an initial “screening” evaluation of each opportunity identified through the origination process outlined above in order to determine whether or not such opportunity is in line with our investment strategy, risk appetite and target returns. The investment team will also consider whether the opportunity could be serviced by us, or whether a third-party service provider will be required. _Initial Analysis_ If the investment team determines, through the screening process described above, that an opportunity should be pursued, the investment team will conduct an initial analysis in order to formulate the optimal plan for conducting a more detailed assessment of that opportunity. This initial analysis will typically include the following steps: - the investment team will review the initial data received from the debt seller or intermediary and will request any additional data necessary to accurately price and evaluate the opportunity in a way that would be adequate to support a non-binding offer as described below; - the investment team will determine the level of due diligence that is required at this stage of the evaluation process; and/or - the investment team will conduct an initial review of the sale and purchase agreement if available and any other additional transaction documentation available, such as information memoranda. _Preliminary Investment Recommendation_ If an opportunity passes through the screening and the initial analysis phases, the investment team will prepare a preliminary investment recommendation, which will typically incorporate the following: - the investment team will prepare forecast collection curves and will work with our portfolio management team and our internal or external servicing platforms to develop the optimal servicing strategy for the opportunity and to determine the servicing costs to produce a net cash flow forecast and forecast return on investment. These collection curves will utilize our proprietary experience, statistical models using historical data sets and/or external data sources; and/or ----- - the investment team will engage with colleagues from other functions (including legal, operations, finance, risk or compliance, as appropriate) to develop all aspects of the preliminary investment recommendation. The preliminary investment recommendation is reviewed by the Investment Committee, and, if approved, the transaction will typically proceed to the non-binding offer stage. _Non-Binding Offer_ The non-binding offer will typically include the following details, although the debt seller will often prescribe what details are required to be included: - an indicative purchase price for the opportunity, determined on the basis of the initial analysis described above, together with a summary of the key assumptions on which the purchase price is based; - details of any further diligence that we require in order to submit a binding pricing proposal; - confirmation of approvals already obtained to submit the non-binding offer and the approval process for subsequently submitting a binding offer; and/or - an overview of the portfolio servicing strategy to be implemented once the opportunity is acquired. _Due Diligence_ We adhere to a disciplined and comprehensive diligence process that is driven by our knowledge of the market, data access, experience and other relevant points of reference, including third party valuations of real estate assets. We believe that efficient due diligence is conducted both by reference to proven, traditional checks and information as well as insightful, bespoke and transaction-specific inquiry. In particular, we determine a diligence approach appropriate in light of the asset type, proposed transaction structure, location of the asset or any other relevant investment consideration. _Legal, Risk, Tax and Other Departmental Sign-Off_ We fully leverage our in-house expertise throughout the evaluation process. The tax, finance, legal, compliance and risk teams monitor each transaction by attending meetings and reviewing selected due diligence documentation throughout the process until approval, as a second layer of risk management. All departments are required to highlight any areas of concern with explicit sign-off by legal and risk required for each investment. _Investment Approval_ Once the due diligence for a proposed transaction is complete, our investment team prepares a final Investment Committee memorandum and typically we would expect to complete the following steps: ----- - the investment team will seek to refine the forecast curves on the basis of the additional data obtained through the deeper analysis and due diligence; - the investment team will develop “base,” “best” and “worst” case scenario analyses to reflect the high and low boundaries of expected returns based on our prior experience or the known risks relating to the opportunity; - we will conduct a final review of the risks associated with the opportunity, taking into account any factors mitigating such risks, such as a price reduction or additional contractual protections in the sale and purchase agreement, and thereafter prepare an explanation of any risks that cannot be mitigated and a recommended course of action in respect thereof; and/or - the investment team will prepare a contract summary of the key commercial aspects of the sale and purchase agreement. The investment will then be discussed and, if appropriate, approved at an Investment Committee meeting. There are differing levels of committees required depending upon the quantum of the investment. If the opportunity is approved, we proceed to submit a binding offer for the opportunity and, if successful, will seek to execute the transaction to acquire the subject opportunity. _Operational Implementation_ The operational implementation team within each platform is overseen by our portfolio management team and is responsible for ensuring that the investment is “loaded onto” the relevant internal or external platform successfully. This will generally include: - a bespoke implementation plan for each investment; - a review of the transaction documents to ensure a thorough understanding of the contractual obligations; - a project plan to ensure the implementation runs smoothly; - loading loan information onto all relevant systems; - post-implementation oversight, including put-back monitoring (i.e. returning or “putting back” accounts that do not meet the agreed criteria or where the debt seller fails to provide adequate documentation or data on the account), for a specified period of time; and - lessons learned review for consistent improvement. _Portfolio Management_ Our portfolio management team, which is part of the Fund and Investment Management business, is responsible for the post-acquisition management of all portfolio investments, including ----- the Fund, future funds and our back-book. Our portfolio management team is split between: (i) fund-level strategic portfolio management, focusing on fund-level structuring, implementation of portfolio strategies, overseeing fund-level business planning and reporting and leading postpurchase projects; and (ii) in-country portfolio specialists, who utilize market knowledge and expertise to monitor portfolio performance strategies and provide active oversight of in-country servicing platforms. This functional design achieves a balance of fund-level strategic oversight and reporting with local in-country knowledge and expertise. Our portfolio management team has adopted a well-defined and transparent operating and governance regime which drives consistency and clear expectations for all portfolios under management. This also includes appropriate delegated authority and decision frameworks to deliver necessary governance. The primary operating and governance regime comprises: - Fund Performance Management Meeting (“P3M”), which is a strategic fund-level forum covering portfolio performance trends across all investments within a specific fund, together with ongoing portfolio management projects such as financings, asset sales and securitizations. The P3M meets monthly, is led by the portfolio management team and includes senior management representatives from across origination, underwriting, portfolio management, finance and capital allocation. - In-Country Portfolio Performance Committees (“PPC”), which are hosted in each geography and distinct for each fund. The PPC represents the first line control over the relevant servicing platform’s effectiveness in managing that fund’s investments. It meets monthly and includes senior representatives from our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses. The PPC discusses and reviews portfolio performance, seeks to understand what is driving potential under- or over-performance, and sets strategies and actions to improve performance where relevant. Our approach to portfolio management and our team’s engagement with both internal and external servicing platforms continues to adhere to our guiding principle of treating customers fairly and managing debt repayment circumstances based on our customers’ individual requirements. This was particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic when we offered support and guidance at a time when our customers needed us most. _Portfolio Servicing_ Our platforms, including Europa Investimenti, as well as external servicers are responsible for undertaking various activities, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization, legal title holding, due diligence activities, initial platform migration and onboarding activities, master servicing, securitization vehicle set-up and ongoing management activities, new origination activities, litigation and court process management and third-party subservicer management. Our approach to collections is dependent upon the type of portfolio acquired. For example, Capquest Group services unsecured consumer debt in the UK where collections are typically small, regular, annuity-like payments collected over a long period of time, with a highly sophisticated ----- data analytical and statistical approach to collections being employed. Using data analytics to determine the most efficient, effective and regulation-compliant collection strategy, which may involve litigation strategies, we generally pursue two broad types of collection activities: - _Payment plans. Most customers pay by entering into long-term repayment plans, which provides us with significant cash flow visibility. - _One-off payment. These arise when a customer makes a payment (less than the full amount) that leads to the closure of the account and any remaining balance is written off. We make a settlement assumption on each portfolio when it is purchased, which has an impact on the purchase price. Platforms servicing such portfolios employ agents that will contact customers by telephone or increasingly by digital means to seek payments with amounts varying depending on customers’ individual circumstances and the portion of such customers’ disposable income available to service defaulted debt. During 2020, we enhanced our digital capability including a new interactive SMS service which allowed customers to contact us when it suited them most. Conversely, the Italian operation of Europa Investimenti is very different as collection activity typically involves legal and court processes and the realization of esoteric assets. Our highly experienced and skilled team at Europa Investimenti may use external brokers, agents and valuers to provide a bespoke solution to maximizing collections value. An important component of our cash collection strategies is ensuring we operate in accordance with our values and that we achieve fair outcomes for customers while complying with our regulatory responsibilities. Our Group Customer Forum (“GCF”) brings together the best practices developed in the geographies in which we operate, with the aim of improving customer outcomes. The GCF is essential in sharing best practice within each country’s operations and driving forward positive change. It is also tasked with ensuring that we deliver consistent customer treatment - as evidenced by our COVID-19 response - and using data and learned customer behaviors to guide future strategies and service enhancements. The GCF is currently in the process of devising standardized customer experience metrics, including how we can utilize vulnerable customer and complaint management information to improve our processes and policies. We believe that our local and Group customer forums are driving real value, and during 2020 we achieved the following: - increased customer satisfaction scores, averaging 7.7 (out of 9); - the development of a customer framework to govern our commitment to customers and our adherence to our guiding principles for collection activities; - unified vulnerable customer strategies which enabled a swift response to the COVID 19 pandemic, including an immediate hold on litigation activities, the implementation of informal repayment plans of up to three months, as well as other payment arrangements including a switch to interest-only or a reduction and cessation of interest, depending on customer circumstances; ----- - standardized customer key performance indicators, including customer satisfaction, abandonment and breakage rates, complaints and digital uptake; - expanded customer payment and communication channels, including SMS, virtual IBAN, customer portals, live chat and online appointment bookings; - the enhancement of our website to allow for a more customer-friendly browsing experience; and - the undertaking of a deep dive into our vulnerable customer strategy which revealed high levels of satisfaction with focused improvements in respect of customers’ digital experience and customer reviews. We are proud recipients of various customer service awards. Most notably, in 2020 we were awarded the Credit Strategy ‘Best Outsourcing and Partnership’ Initiative for Onboarding and Customer Engagement, in recognition of our work with Virgin Money. Additionally, in November 2020 we became four-time finalists after being nominated at the Credit Strategy Collections and Customer Service Awards. In Portugal, in 2020, our business was recognized not only as a Top Employer but accredited as the Best Credit Portfolio Management Company (Global Banking and Finance Review), Best Asset Management Servicer (International Investor) and Best Practice Operator of the Year (ACQ5, Country Awards 2020).",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.94,Technology Infrastructure,17.94.1,,"We recognize the importance that our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure plays in ensuring that our people can maximize business performance and deliver great outcomes for our customers. Our IT infrastructure is therefore built to provide flexibility, control, resilience and cost effectiveness. We operate a Microsoft first, cloud-based/virtualized approach and have invested in the consolidation of our infrastructure in order to integrate it across our platforms, where appropriate. Our platforms use a number of core systems; Prod and Latitude in the UK and Ireland, Galaxy in Portugal, DaVinci and Credit Navigator in the Netherlands and a SaaS solution known as Sydema in Italy. Development is transitioning to a centralized approach in order to ensure that there is a common and consistent approach across all of our internally developed/managed systems, with a DevOps and SCRUM approach to development and a drive to automate testing. Where we develop systems, we seek to retain ownership of the intellectual property related thereto. For example, in Portugal, we are in the process of developing our own core platform, Galaxy, which is based on core Microsoft technologies and is due to go live in November 2021. We own the intellectual property rights to the Galaxy system. Similarly, we retain the intellectual property for our development of a fund management system that will provide core functionality for our Fund and Investment Management business. In addition, we have developed customer portals allowing customers to self-serve, with customers able to make payments via a portal across many of our platforms. Furthermore, we are also developing a more automated solution for our third-party clients enabling a seamless use of our technology through ‘white label’ solutions. ----- Data is key to our value proposition and is therefore safeguarded for the benefit of our colleagues, customers and clients. A fundamental area of operational risk management and operational resilience is our approach to information security. We benchmark our minimum information security standards against the international standard of good practice for information security, ISO 27001. Our framework involves identifying our critical data and applying the relevant protection controls to safeguard such data. We acknowledge, however, that the cyber-risk landscape is continually evolving, and in response to this, we are investing in our people, processes and technology in order to protect our colleagues, customers and clients, as well as to strengthen our ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats. Given that cyber-attacks are inevitable, we continue to focus on deploying resources, training our personnel and building up our technological resilience. We utilize a number of systems, such as Netscope, Mimecast and Okta to respond to potential cyber threats made via the web and our internal email and authentication systems. Although cyber risk forms a critical component of our operational resilience and scenario testing, we acknowledge that it is not the only business disruptor that can have a significant impact on our operations. As such, the development and strengthening of our business operating model encompasses the development of our culture, processes and systems such that our business is best placed to perform in line with our strategy in the face of disruption, regardless of the source of such disruption. This holistic approach to the development of the systems involved in our business will enable us to anticipate, protect and plan for operation recovery. Our approach to business continuity for our IT infrastructure is to ensure that our systems are “always on,” enabled by our use of cloud-based data centers. As such, in the event of a system breakdown, we expect to be able to recover all systems within approximately two hours with only minimal transaction history data loss. The COVID-19 pandemic represented a real-time test of our operational resilience, and our ability to respond positively to the COVID-19 pandemic has been critical to our stakeholders. Our cloud-based approach allows access to our systems via the internet from any location at any time and as a result, all of our personnel were able to work from home on a fully operational basis by the end of March 2021. Despite transitioning our customer service operations to remote working, our customers, who already have access to our customer self-service portals for payments across many of our platforms, were supported seamlessly with no outage in customer service delivery. The high quality of service we continued to deliver during 2020 is evidenced by the fact that we received various awards for our customer-service operations, most notably the Credit Strategy ‘Best Outsourcing and Partnership’ Initiative for Onboarding and Customer Engagement, in recognition of our work with Virgin Money. Building upon the resilience of our operations and IT infrastructure, the roll out of Arrow Everywhere is still underway and is expected to allow greater technological flexibility for our employees who work remotely. In addition to protecting our data and systems from external threats, we also actively manage our data in line with our internal data governance and management strategy. To ensure compliance with this strategy and the applicable regulations, including GDPR and UK GDPR, we utilize tools, such as Exonar and Primed, to trawl systems to manage data and create a framework for compliance in line with contractual and regulatory requirements. ----- We recently completed the first phase of our strategic finance and reporting transformation program, which involves the implementation of a common Microsoft Enterprise platform to standardize finance processes and controls across the Group. This will provide greater levels of insight, increased control and reduced reporting timelines through increased efficiency, and will also support the delivery of our strategy by strengthening the control environment and by producing higher quality information and analytics thereby enabling a better understanding of the commercial drivers of the business and enhanced strategic decision-making.

We have a rigorous and selective recruitment, training and retention strategy in order to maintain our high standards of service. All newly recruited employees are provided with a comprehensive induction program which includes comprehensive training on our legal and regulatory compliance policies. Employee performance is tracked through on-going performance management reviews and a performance grading system. In addition, employees involved in collection activities have additional monitoring, training and customer ratings to ensure fair outcomes for customers.

See “Business—Our Vision and Strategy—Environmental, Social and _Governance (“ESG”) focus driving better operational outcomes.” We recognize long-term_ sustainable success is linked to the fortunes of the stakeholders that we serve. As society’s expectation of businesses continues to grow, we aim to stay ahead of those expectations. We believe that by integrating sustainability and ESG considerations throughout our operations, we can enhance our business performance, support the financial health of our customers and better support the diverse communities within which we operate. Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the resilience of our purpose and values and we are confident that we have responded in a timely and thoughtful manner, with much success in relation to many of our stakeholders such as colleagues, clients and our markets as a whole. Our social commitments were demonstrated as customers received additional support as required, with specific COVID-19 customer outcomes provided to help those most in need throughout the pandemic. Our exemplary approach to the treatment of customers also feeds into our meeting the expectations of portfolio sellers and our third party asset management clients, as such clients seek assurance that their customers will be handled responsibly. Communication with our regulators is always beneficial but was key during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our regulators require consistent assurance that our policies, processes and practices reach regulatory muster and we consistently aim to maintain open communication with regulators and compliance with regulations. Our colleagues benefitted from swift deployment of working from home protocols supported by our IT, business continuity and crisis management teams. As well as prioritizing the safety and well-being of our stakeholders during the COVID-19 pandemic, the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has informed our operational resilience and colleague engagement plans going forward. It also translates into benefits for both existing and new clients based upon the quality of delivery that we showed even in an unprecedented operating environment. Our governance focus remained strong throughout 2020, with additional levels of decision-making control being used during the pandemic in addition to our existing country-level, executive and board committees.

At that time, we were cautious about the wider economic conditions and revalued the ERC balance sheet asset at the half year 2020, resulting in a non-cash impairment of portfolio investments of £133.6 million. Cash Collections have performed strongly against these revised estimates, outperforming the estimates by approximately 25% in the second half of 2020. For the ----- first half of 2021, our collections performance was £179.6 million, representing 119% of the December 2020 forecast ERC. The impact of COVID-19 on the wider macro-economic environment remains uncertain, in particular once government support schemes, such as the furlough scheme in the UK, are withdrawn. While we remain cautious, the resilience of collections performance was evident during July and August 2021. We believe the adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition will primarily be driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic’s long-term impact on the markets in which we are active and the global economy and the timing, scope and effectiveness of government responses to the pandemic, which are all beyond our knowledge and control. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the long-term adverse impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition, but the adverse impact could be material.

At present, the level of primary auction sales has been relatively low as banks have focused on initial provisioning over asset sales. Whilst we do expect the primary markets to become more active during the latter part of 2021 and into 2022, we have seen strong appetite for our servicing capabilities from financial institutions which require additional collections capacity given the growth in NPLs. Throughout 2020, we secured a record 26 new contract wins. Further, on August 17, 2021, we announced plans to acquire the collections and recoveries operations within Tesco Bank’s Customer Service division. This partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced service to customers in financial difficulty by providing the necessary support and flexibility they will need in the future, with Tesco Bank choosing to partner with us, given our customer focus, proven expertise, technology platform and the cultural alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The partnership is expected to result in our taking on over 200 Tesco Bank personnel on November 1, 2021. Overall, we believe that we have a strong pipeline of opportunities for further new third-party contracts. In addition, the importance of our origination capability, through our trusted relationships, access to secondary markets and our local platforms, resulted in approximately 74% of our deals being originated off-market during 2020 (based on our calculations) and has ensured that origination volumes have been strong during the first half of 2021. Our Balance Sheet business invested £94.8 million for the first half of 2021. Furthermore, 54% of the Fund was deployed or committed (gross, before capital recycling) as at June 30, 2021, compared with 45% as at March 31, 2021. We expect to reach 70% deployment (after cash recycling) by early 2022 (provided that deployment rates remain consistent with historical deployment rates), enabling the start of fundraising for our second fund in respect of which we are targeting a €2.5 billion fundraise.

However, given the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment, we have remained cautious in our approach to pricing and underwriting investment opportunities. Deployment has focused more on off-market real estate and special situation investments with shorter weighted average life, rather than unsecured investments that tend to have a longer weighted average life. This approach to capital deployment allows us to achieve target returns whilst seeking to minimize the risk profile of our investments. The average Net Deal IRR of investments purchased during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was 16%, reflecting our cautious underwriting. The 2020 vintage (i.e., deals purchased in the year ended December 31, 2020) has continued to perform strongly with the Net Deal IRR for the 2020 vintage rising from 18% as of December 31, 2020 to 21% as of June 30, 2021.

However, these do not cover all aspects of debt collection regulation, so it is not possible to comply with a single rulebook in the UK and the EU. Each country in the EU has developed its own set of rules for debt collection operations. The various regulations cover, among others: the methods by which claims can be assigned or transferred; the ways in which a customer can be contacted and a debt collected; and the types and level of fees, interests and costs that can be imposed, and whether those fees, interests and costs can be passed to the customer or the client. In countries where there are no specific regulations covering debt collection and where no licensing requirements apply for certain debt collection operations, there are still regulations of a more general nature which we must observe when carrying out our debt collection operations. Such regulations include, for example, general civil and commercial rules and consumer protection laws and regulations regarding caps on collection fees and interest costs. Any regulatory changes reducing the amount of such costs we can recover may have a negative impact on our results of operations. In all countries in which our operations are licensed or regulated, our subsidiaries are subject to certain integrity tests with respect to debt collection. These integrity tests may include verifying that the collection business is carried out in accordance with local rules and regulations; the directors of the board have sufficient knowledge and experience and have not misused any debt collection permissions; and the directors meet other general suitability and reliability checks.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

In a majority of the countries in which we operate, it is possible to extend the statutes of limitation on historic debt claims indefinitely by using various methods, including enforcement actions, notification of the customer or otherwise interrupting the limitation period with continued court proceedings. Some of the countries in which we operate have in the past changed the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability to extend or interrupt the limitation period, or have discussed doing so. We constantly monitor any changes in these rules in the countries in which we operate, and, where appropriate, implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations period. Any significant reduction in the statute of limitations or in the ability to toll the statute of limitations, and any failure to implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations periods, would negatively impact our operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The 4th,17.100.1,United Kingdom,"The consumer credit and mortgage industry in the UK is highly regulated. Operating in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements requires considerable investment in processes, know-how and management. The FCA is primarily responsible for the regulation of conduct in retail, as well as wholesale, financial markets and the infrastructure that supports those markets. The FCA’s “operational objectives” are to protect and enhance confidence in the UK financial system by securing an appropriate degree of protection for consumers, protecting and enhancing the integrity of financial markets and promoting effective competition in the interests of consumers. The FCA also has a “strategic objective” of ensuring that relevant markets it regulates function well. In the UK, the principal sources for the regulation of consumer credit activities and mortgage conduct are: - the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000; - the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (SI 2001/544); - (for consumer credit activities) retained provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and some related secondary legislation; - (for mortgage conduct) the Mortgage Credit Directive Order 2015; and - the rules and guidance in the FCA Handbook (including CONC, which is the FCA specialist sourcebook that applies to firms carrying on credit-related regulated activities, and MCOB, which is the conduct of business sourcebook for mortgages and home finance). Until April 1, 2014, consumer credit in the UK was regulated under the CCA, with the OFT responsible for protecting consumer interests and regulating consumer credit firms. The regulation of consumer credit activities in the UK under the CCA implements, but goes well beyond the requirements of the CCD. Responsibility for regulating consumer credit activities was transferred ----- to the FCA in April 2014 as an additional function to be undertaken within the framework of FSMA and certain retained parts of the CCA. The MCD sets out the EU’s framework of conduct rules for mortgage firms and was implemented in the UK through the MCDO. The domestic legislation implementing both the MCD and the CCD have been retained in UK law following its departure from the EU by virtue of the EUWA. In keeping with its operational objectives, the FCA carries out thematic reviews, conducts consultations and revises its policy and rules as part of its ongoing process of regulating the consumer credit and mortgage industry. Identification of poor practices or poor outcomes for consumers can result in policy and rule changes that bring about significant changes. For example, the FCA: - introduced a price cap on high-cost short-term credit (including “pay-day loans”) which came into force on January 2, 2015. In a Feedback Statement issued in July 2017, the FCA confirmed its decision to maintain this price cap. The Feedback Statement also identified key areas of concern with the high-cost credit sector including arranged and unarranged overdrafts, rent-to-own, home-collected credit and catalogue credit. Further to that Feedback Statement, on January 31, 2018, the FCA issued a High-Cost Credit Review Update in which it confirmed its ongoing concerns with these areas. The FCA also announced a price cap on “rent to own” products in March 2019; - published the final report of its market study of competition in the credit card market on July 26, 2016, which found that, while competition was working fairly well, credit card firms could do more to help higher risk consumers and those with persistently high credit card debt, such as by identifying early signs of debt problems and intervening accordingly. In April and December 2017, the FCA consulted further in this area and has introduced further changes to address its concerns. On February 27, 2018, the FCA published its final policy statement on new rules for the credit card market. The changes provided more protection for credit card customers in persistent debt or at risk of financial difficulties. The new rules came into force on March 1, 2018, and firms have had until September 1, 2018, to comply with them; - published the findings of its thematic review of early arrears management in unsecured lending on December 13, 2016, which found (among others) that, for customers showing signs of financial difficulty, the majority of firms missed early opportunities to identify this and offer appropriate forbearance; - published final guidance on April 24, 2017, on the fair treatment of mortgage customers in payment shortfall which requires firms to cease the practice of automatic capitalization and provide redress to affected customers; - published the findings of its thematic review on staff incentives and remuneration in consumer credit firms on July 4, 2017, which found that a significant proportion of firms had high risk financial incentives likely to encourage high-pressure sales or collections and had inadequate or ineffective controls; ----- - published a consultation paper on July 31, 2017, on assessing creditworthiness, including affordability, in consumer credit the purpose of which is to amend the FCA’s rules and guidance in order to clarify its expectations of firms (such as factors to be taken into account when assessing whether credit is likely to be affordable); - announced its intention in July 2018 to consult on mandating removal of the minimum repayment anchor as part of its efforts to limit the use of credit cards for longer-term borrowing; - published its policy statement in July 2018 with final rules on assessing creditworthiness in consumer credit; and - published the Woolard Review report to the FCA Board on February 2, 2021 on change and innovation in the unsecured credit market, which set out a number of recommendations to the FCA for improving regulation of the unsecured lending market. Additional exceptional measures have been taken by the FCA in response to the COVID19 pandemic. Beginning in March 2020, the FCA announced, through guidance (and subsequently, through the updating of that guidance in June, November and December 2020), measures for supporting mortgage borrowers experiencing payment difficulties. According to the FCA’s guidance: “… where a customer is experiencing or reasonably expects to experience payment difficulties as a result of circumstances relating to coronavirus, and wishes to receive a full payment deferral, a firm should grant a customer a full payment deferral for three monthly payments, unless it can demonstrate it is obviously not in a customer’s best interests.” The FCA issued similar payment deferral guidance for consumers experiencing difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic in repaying credit products (including personal loans, credit cards, store cards, catalogue credit, motor finance, rent-to-own, buy now pay later and pawn broking agreements). The FCA’s guidance contemplates that such deferral schemes would end on July 31, 2021. The Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space Moratorium and Mental Health Crisis Moratorium) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020 (the “Debt Respite Scheme”) came into force on May 4, 2021. Broadly, the Debt Respite Scheme provides for two types of relief: (i) protections available to anyone with debt protecting them from creditor action for up to 60 days by pausing most enforcement action, preventing contact from creditors, and freezing most interest and charges; and (ii) protections available to debtors receiving mental health crisis treatment. In July 2021, the FCA published its business plan for 2021/22. Among the priorities for the period are an increased focus on authorization, to ensure that from the point of authorization firms have high standards and maintain them. The FCA also intends to proceed with its work on the introduction of a new consumer duty, requiring firms to put consumers at the center of their business plans. There are also a number of initiatives scheduled for 2021 including: a consultation on bringing interest-free buy-now pay-later credit agreements within the FCA’s authority; a review ----- of the high-cost short-term credit price cap; and a consultation paper on how to provide ongoing support to borrowers in financial difficulty. At the European level, the European Commission published a legislative proposal to amend the CCD in June 2021, and published a report on its review on the MCD in May 2021 that may also lead to further legislative changes. As is the case across many financial services industries, the industry in which we operate is currently undergoing, and may in the future undergo, a number of significant regulatory changes. These affect us, Investment Portfolio Sellers and our DCAs. We believe that the regulatory environment favors participants with scale, such as us, that are more likely to be able to adapt and comply with evolving consumer protection policy and the increasing volume of regulation in the industry. Investment Portfolio Sellers are also becoming increasingly cautious in their selection of debt purchasers and DCA partners, and those who can demonstrate robust compliance processes are favored. _The UK Consumer Credit Regulatory Framework_ Since April 1, 2014, the FCA’s responsibilities have been extended to the consumer credit market and regulated consumer credit activities such as lending, credit brokerage and other ancillary credit-related activities. As noted above, the consumer credit regime principally consists of FSMA, the CCA and the FCA Handbook (in particular, CONC). Many of the requirements applicable to regulated credit agreements are prescriptive in nature and include obligations to: - provide customers with prescribed pre-contractual information; - ensure that credit agreement documentation complies with prescribed, detailed content and form requirements; - provide customers with copies of credit agreement documentation at the outset and during the term of the agreement upon request; - provide customers with prescribed forms of notices in relation to defaults and termination; - provide customers with prescribed forms of post-contractual statements and notices; - ensure an “unfair relationship” does not arise between the lender and the borrower; and - ensure that their agreements do not contain unfair terms (and, if they do, the legislation provides that any unfair terms are not binding on the customer). In addition to regulatory action, non-compliance with these requirements could, for example, result in the underlying loan agreement being unenforceable against the borrower and the borrower having no liability to pay interest or default charges (for the period of noncompliance). ----- _The UK Mortgage Regulatory Framework_ The mortgage regime principally consists of FSMA, the MCDO and the FCA Handbook (in particular, MCOB). The regulation of residential mortgage business entered into force on October 31, 2004. There have been incremental changes to the mortgage regime over time—for example, there is no longer a requirement for the security to be first ranking in order for a mortgage to fall within the mortgage regime and some mortgages which were previously subject to the consumer credit regime are now subject to the mortgage regime (although some protections afforded by the consumer credit regime may still be available). Some of these changes were introduced as a result of the MCD, which was transposed into UK law through the MCDO on March 21, 2016, which remains in force pursuant to the EUWA. The MCD is focused on residential mortgages with the intention of preventing the irresponsible lending and borrowing practices that became apparent during the financial crisis. It is also aimed at creating a more efficient and competitive single market for mortgages. The implementation of the MCD has also resulted in greater regulation for certain consumer buy-to-let mortgages than was previously the case (for example, the Mortgage Credit Directive Order introduced conduct of business regulations and information requirements for customers of consumer buy-to-let mortgages). Many of the requirements of the MCD were pre-emptively introduced in the UK through the FCA’s Mortgage Market Review in April 2014. However, the MCD is broader in scope than the previous UK mortgage regulation and applies a standard approach to first charge mortgage contracts and second and subsequent charge mortgage contracts, whereas previously the FCA distinguished between the two. The implementation of the MCD has resulted in the first and subsequent charge mortgage markets being much more closely aligned, primarily by now treating second and subsequent charge contracts as regulated mortgage contracts. We currently use third parties to service accounts affected by the MCD, relying (pursuant to Article 62(a) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001) on their regulatory permissions for mortgage administration. _FCA Authorization_ Pursuant to Section 19 of FSMA, a firm must be authorized to carry on regulated activities by way of business in the UK. A contravention of this requirement is a criminal offense (and may result in any underlying customer agreements being unenforceable without a validation order). Similar sanctions may also apply for breaches of the financial promotions regime. Additionally, the direct and indirect involvement or an unauthorized person in a regulated activity may result in the underlying customer agreement being unenforceable (and may, for example, also allow that customer to recover monies/property and/or seek compensation). Examples of regulated activities include: - entering into a regulated credit agreement as lender; ----- - exercising, or having the right to exercise, the lender’s rights and duties under a regulated credit agreement (therefore, debt purchasers who acquire the lender’s rights and duties under the credit agreement are required to be authorized); - debt administration; - debt collection; - entering into a regulated mortgage contract; - administering a regulated mortgage contract; and - agreeing to carry on a regulated activity. Arrow Global Limited has been registered with the LSB as an associate subscriber since July 2016. Arrow Global Limited, Arrow Global Massey Limited, Arrow Global Legh Limited, Capquest Debt Recovery Limited and Drydens Limited are currently the only Group businesses with full FCA authorization to conduct certain consumer credit-related regulated activities in the UK. Mars Capital Finance Limited and Drydens Limited have full FCA authorization to conduct certain mortgage-related regulated activities in the UK. Prior to granting full authorization for a firm to carry on regulated activities, the FCA is required to carry out a thorough assessment of the applicant, including their business model, and to determine whether that firm will meet the required organizational and suitability standards (referred to as the “threshold conditions”). The “threshold conditions” are the minimum organizational and suitability requirements which must be satisfied in order to obtain (and maintain) FCA authorization. These relate to matters including the location of the firm’s offices, whether the firm is capable of being effectively supervised by the FCA, the quality and quantity of the firm’s resources (including both financial and management resources), whether the firm is a “fit and proper person” to conduct the relevant activities and whether the firm has a suitable business model. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, none of our entities has had any application to obtain any authorization, permission, permit or license refused or denied or has had any authorization, permission, permit or license cancelled (other than on its own initiative). _FCA Handbook_ The FCA’s approach to regulation and the standards it requires firms to maintain are set out primarily in the FCA Handbook (mainly in the form of rules and guidance). Some of the requirements that apply to the UK Regulated Firms are set out in the following sections of the FCA Handbook: PRIN, GEN, SYSC, SUP, MCOB, CONC and COCON. PRIN are a general statement of the fundamental obligations that firms must comply with under the regulatory system and are regarded by the FCA as the basis for most of the other more detailed rules and guidance and include, for example, principles that a firm must conduct its ----- business with integrity; pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly; and deal with its regulators in an open and cooperative way and disclose to the FCA appropriately anything relating to the firm of which the FCA would reasonably expect notice. The rules in: - GEN relate to matters such as status disclosure and interpretation of the FCA Handbook; - SYSC require firms to organize and control their affairs responsibly and effectively, including requiring firms to establish and maintain appropriate and risk-sensitive financial crime policies and procedures, and to identify, assess and mitigate the risk of money laundering in their business. They also include, among others, general organizational requirements relating to governance, requirements relating to the skills, knowledge and expertise of staff, Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SMCR”), outsourcing responsibilities, record-keeping requirements and rules relating to conflicts of interests; - SUP relate to ongoing supervisory matters, setting out the relationship between the FCA and the firms it regulates, including requirements for firms to make various notifications to the FCA and detailing supervisory powers; - MCOB require firms carrying on home finance related activity (such as regulated mortgage lenders and servicers) to comply with requirements on matters such as preand post-contractual requirements, responsible lending, charges, arrears and repossessions; - CONC require firms carrying on consumer credit related activity to comply with requirements on matters such as pre- and post-contractual requirements, responsible lending, debt collection and debt advice; and - COCON sets out the FCA’s rules concerning the conduct of certain persons working in firms. A contravention by a firm of any requirements set out in the FCA Handbook could result in regulatory action (for example, the imposition of a financial sanction) and/or (in certain cases) a claim for damages brought by a private person (for example, a borrower under a loan agreement). _Senior Managers and Certification Regime_ In response to the 2008 banking crisis, the UK Parliamentary Commission for Banking Standards (“PCBS”) recommended a new accountability framework focused on senior management, with authorized firms taking more responsibility for assessing whether their own employees are fit and proper. The FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) began applying SMCR to the banking sector from March 2016; Parliament made further changes to legislation in May 2016, and required the regime to be extended to all FSMA-authorized firms from December 9, 2019. ----- The key elements of the SMCR are: - _Senior Managers: the most senior individuals who perform specified roles or functions within the firm (“Senior Management Functions”) are the ‘Senior Managers;’ senior managers require approval by the FCA; each senior manager has a “statement of responsibilities” detailing the areas they are responsible for; certain “prescribed responsibilities” specified by the regulator must be allocated to one or more of the senior managers; and senior managers are subject to a statutory “duty of responsibility” requiring them to take reasonable steps to prevent, or stop, a breach of rules in their area; - _Certification Staff: employees who are not Senior Managers but whose job can cause significant harm to the firm, its customers or the integrity of the market, fall within the certification regime; amongst other requirements, these employees must be certified as fit and proper by the firm; - _Code of Conduct: the conduct rules set basic standards of personal conduct; they apply to almost all employees within firms; some conduct rules apply to everyone within scope, some apply only to senior managers; firms are required to give training on the conduct rules and notify the FCA if they have taken disciplinary action against an employee for breach of them; and - _Ongoing assessment: firms must assess whether Senior Managers and certified staff are “fit and proper,” on an ongoing basis and at least annually; as part of the initial fit and proper assessment, firms are expected to request regulatory references to cover the last six years of employment. _Controllers Regime_ Any potential acquirer seeking to acquire 20% or more of the shares or voting power in one of the UK Regulated Firms or one of their parent undertakings (or, shares or voting power in either as a result of which that acquirer would be able to exercise significant influence over the management of one of the UK Regulated Firms), will have to obtain the FCA’s prior approval and notify the FCA if it should dispose of shares or voting power such that its holding falls below 20%. A failure to obtain FCA approval will amount to a criminal offense. _Unfair Terms_ In the UK, the UTCCR applies to agreements entered into with a consumer on or after July 1, 1995, but prior to October 1, 2015 (and were not individually negotiated). The CRA (which came into force on October 1, 2015) consolidated much of the existing consumer rights law in the UK. Among others, it repealed the UTCCR in relation to new consumer contracts made on or after October 1, 2015, and effectively merged the consumer protection rules under the UTCCR and the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. The CRA applies to agreements entered into with a consumer on or after October 1, 2015, or agreements which were, since October 1, 2015, subject to a material variation such that they are treated as new agreements falling within the scope of the CRA. The CRA also applies to notices of variation (such as variation of interest rates) made since October 1, 2015. ----- Under the UTCCR and CRA, it is possible that any agreement that has been made or entered into with a consumer may contain terms that are deemed by a court (or other body) to be “unfair,” which may result in the possible unenforceability of such terms (and may ultimately affect the ability to collect payment under any loan). However, a term of an agreement may not generally be assessed for fairness if it specifies the main subject matter of the contract or relates to the appropriateness of the price payable under the contract by comparison with the goods or services supplied under it (provided that the term is written in plain and intelligible language and brought to the consumer’s attention in such a way that the average consumer would be aware of the term). In light of the broad and general wording of the UTCCR and CRA, it can be difficult to predict whether a court (or other competent body) would find a term to be unfair. It is therefore possible that any agreement covered by the UTCCR, the CRA or any other unfair terms legislation may contain terms that are deemed to be unfair, which may result in the possible unenforceability of such terms of such agreement. Since the UTCCR and CRA are based on an EU directive, similar issues may arise in EU Member States. _Unfair Relationships_ The CCA provides for an “unfair relationship” test which applies to a broad range of credit agreements. In the event that a court determines a relationship between a creditor and debtor to be unfair, it has broad powers to grant a wide range of remedies (for example, the court could require certain sums to be repaid to the debtor). There is no statutory definition of what would amount to an “unfair relationship” as the test is intended to provide flexibility. By way of example, the UK courts have determined a relationship to be unfair where (i) broker commissions (the existence and/or amount) were not disclosed to debtors prior to their entry into a loan agreement and (ii) payment protection insurance commissions were not disclosed to debtors prior to their entry into a loan agreement. _Supervision and Enforcement_ The FCA has wide powers to supervise, and intervene in, the affairs of a regulated firm. It can, for instance, require firms to provide particular information or documents to it, formally investigate a firm or undertake sector-wide projects to address risks across, for example, a range of firms or particular market segment. The FCA’s supervisory approach is built around three types of work. The first type is proactive, which entails pre-emptive identification of harm through review and assessment of firms and portfolios. The second type is reactive, which addresses issues that are emerging or have already happened at a firm. The third type is thematic, which entails wider diagnostic or remedy work where there is actual or potential harm across a number of firms. The FCA undertakes monitoring of regulated firms and may ask to perform an on-site visit to ensure that the business of such firms is compliant with all of the applicable requirements. ----- Where consumer detriment (for example) is found, the FCA will use its powers of intervention, which might include taking enforcement action and/or securing redress for consumers. Firms are categorized by the FCA, which is the conduct regulator for around 51,000 financial services firms, for supervisory purposes on a risk basis to determine the level of supervision applied, varying from having dedicated supervisory teams through to ad-hoc supervision. The FCA may use its investigatory powers to look at past behavior but will then apply the sanctions that were in force at the time of the breach. The FCA’s investigatory powers allow the FCA to require persons to answer questions and provide documents or information and to apply for warrants to enter and search premises. The FCA also has the power to bring civil, criminal and disciplinary proceedings. These powers enable the FCA to, for example: - withdraw authorizations and approvals; - stop individuals from working in financial services; - stop an individual from carrying out specific regulated activities; - suspend a firm from carrying out specific regulated activities; - suspend an individual from carrying out specific regulated activities; - publicly censure firms and senior managers; - impose substantial financial penalties; - seek injunctions; - apply to court to freeze a firm’s or individual’s assets; - seek restitution orders; and - prosecute firms and individuals who undertake regulated activities without authorization. _Complaints Reporting and Publishing Requirements_ Regulated firms must record every complaint they receive, including how they resolved it, and keep the record for three years. Firms will also be required to provide the FCA with a report of the complaints they have received every six months (although some exceptions apply to smaller firms). There is also a general obligation on firms to publish a summary of their complaints data, with specific rules on the timing of publications. The information about complaints that firms must provide and how often firms should report and publish complaints will depend on the activities they carry out. ----- _Complaints and Compensation Arrangements_ In the UK, the FOS acts as an independent adjudicator of the complaints made to it (by individuals and small enterprises). A decision by the FOS is binding on the business, but not on the complainant. There are formal escalation procedures for a complainant to make a complaint to the FOS. However, the FOS, rather than necessarily making a decision solely on the basis of strict compliance with the law, makes its decision on the basis of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances, taking account of the law, rules and good market practice. The FOS can address complaints in relation to a regulated firm’s regulated and unregulated activities. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme is the UK’s statutory compensation scheme for customers of financial services firms. It can pay compensation to customers if a firm is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it. Since April 2018, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme has covered debt management firms. _Data Protection_ The GDPR entered into force on May 25, 2018. The UK is no longer a member of the EU, but has retained the GDPR in its domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the body of law retained in the UK, including the Data Protection Act 2018, is referred to as the “UK DPA”). The GDPR applies to (i) organizations that process the personal data of data subjects (natural persons) located in the EEA in the context of the activities of an establishment in the EEA and (ii) organizations outside the EEA that offer goods or services to data subjects in the EEA, or that monitor the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The UK DPA applies to (i) organizations that process the personal data of data subjects located in the UK in the context of the activities of an establishment in the UK and (ii) organizations outside the UK that offer goods or services to data subjects in the UK, or that monitor the behavior of data subjects in the UK. For the purposes of the GDPR and the UK DPA, personal data is information that can be used to identify a natural person, including a name, a photo, an email address, or a computer IP address. The GDPR and the UK DPA (and other similar data protection laws in other countries) provide greater protection for data subjects by requiring, amongst other things, personal data to be processed lawfully in a fair and transparent manner, to be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and to be limited to what is adequate or necessary in relation to those purposes. Data controllers must be able to respond to the rights of data subjects, which includes the right of individuals to access their personal data, to seek to rectify inaccurate data, to have personal data erased where processing is no longer required, to seek to restrict the processing of their personal data, and to object to the processing of their personal data. Controllers and processors of personal data must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the rights of data subjects and ensure a level of security against loss, misuse or unauthorized access. A personal data breach which results in the likelihood of a risk to the rights of a data subject must be notified to an appropriate supervisory authority without undue delay; a breach with a high risk to the rights of a data subject must be notified to the data subject (also without undue delay). Where third parties are involved in the processing of personal data, or where personal data is being transferred to other countries that do not provide an adequate level of protection, appropriate arrangements must be put in place, such as, e.g., the use of standard contractual clauses. ----- Certain violations of these data protection laws may result in significant administrative fines, e.g., under the GDPR, organizations can be fined up to €20 million, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Any failure to comply with privacy and data protection related obligations may therefore result in significant liability, which could have an adverse effect on the reputation of that party and its business. In the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office or ICO is an independent governmental authority responsible for maintaining, upholding and promoting the best business practices and legislative requirements for processing personal data and safeguarding the rights of individuals with respect to their personal data. The ICO is empowered to impose requirements through enforcement notices (in effect, stop orders), issue monetary fines and prosecute criminal offenses under the UK DPA. We control the processing of significant amounts of personal data. We have undertaken a data protection impact assessment, updated our contracts with processors, published a privacy notice, implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to maintain the security of personal data and established a data protection policy, an information security policy and a data retention policy and we follow the applicable guidance issued from time to time by the ICO, in particular, e.g., in relation to the handling of data subject access requests from individuals. The OFT, the ICO, the CSA and the DBSG have in the past indicated their support for data sharing practices that enhance compliance and improve the customer’s debt collection experience, and the FCA has also indicated such support. Following a consultation, the ICO published the Data Sharing Code of Practice in December 2020, which was laid before Parliament in May 2021; it became a statutory code of practice on data sharing in July 2021. _LSB’s Standards of Lending Practice_ The LSB is a self-regulatory organization that promotes fair lending and positive consumer outcomes in the UK principally through the Standards of Lending Practice. The Standards of Lending Practice (previously the Lending Code) developed by the LSB came into operation on October 1, 2016, and are applicable to UK banks and lenders who are registered with the LSB. According to the LSB’s website, the personal standards came into force on October 1, 2016 and were most recently updated on April 8, 2021 (with effect from July 1, 2021). The business standards came into force on July 1, 2017 and were most recently updated on August 5, 2020 to provide advice on products offered under the Government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans Scheme and Bounce Back Loan Scheme. We have been registered with the LSB as an associate subscriber since July 2016. The majority of UK Investment Portfolio Sellers are registered with the LSB and, therefore, look to ensure that their third-party service providers and debt purchasers also comply with the requirements of the LSB and specific credit business activities. As a consequence of being registered with the LSB, we are expected to comply with the relevant provisions of the Standards of Lending Practice. Our policies are reviewed and updated against the requirements of the Standards of Lending Practice. ----- The LSB actively carries out thematic reviews and/or publishes reports in respect of activities that are relevant to us, primarily in relation to the Standards of Lending Practice for personal customers. The LSB conducts reviews of each standard or code, as well as risk-based thematic reviews. The LSB generally seeks to understand how firms meet their commitments in its less formal capacity, and as new concerns relating to consumer outcomes emerge, adapt the Standards of Lending Practice accordingly to help firms develop an appropriate approach for dealing with them. Given the regulatory focus on ensuring fair treatment for both personal and business customers and, by their nature, the evolving Standards of Lending Practice, industry participants may be subject to additional compliance burdens which may have an impact on our profitability. In addition, the findings of the LSB’s reviews may trigger investigatory work or enforcement action by the FCA. _The Capquest Group_ The Capquest Group, which is a UK consumer debt purchaser and outsourced collections provider, contains one operating company (Capquest Debt Recovery Limited) which is subject to the regulatory framework as set out above. Additionally, one operating company (Capquest Mortgage Servicing Limited) holds regulatory permissions allowing it to service regulated mortgages. Consequently, this entity currently is subject to certain rules within the FCA regime for regulated mortgage activities in addition to the regime in respect of regulated consumer credit activities described above. _Debt Claims Protocol_ The Pre-action Protocol for Debt Claims (the “Debt Protocol”) is a pre-action protocol setting out the steps the court would normally expect parties to take before commencing proceedings. Pre-action protocols are approved by the Master of the Rolls and are annexed to the Civil Procedure Rules. The Debt Protocol has as its core principle that debtors should be provided with sufficient information to enable them to obtain advice on their position prior to the issue of a claim from the creditor. The Debt Protocol requires the provision of various documentation before litigation proceedings are commenced, including, for example, a full statement of account, a copy of the original credit agreement and details of any assignment together with details of the notice of assignment; imposes time periods before proceedings can be commenced; and calls for resort to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms before starting court proceedings. Failure to comply with the Debt Protocol in respect of a claim could adversely affect our ability to pursue litigation in respect of such claim. In addition, the FCA may not regard litigation as an appropriate remedy in certain circumstances. In January 2021, the FCA wrote a ‘Dear Board of Directors’ letter to portfolio firms identifying certain poor practices involving litigation, including seeking judgement from vulnerable customers. The FCA stated that it expects firms to pay due regard to the interests of their customers and treat them fairly.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The 4th,17.100.2,Portugal,"Hefesto is a regulated securitization vehicle (sociedade de titularização de créditos) which is a limited liability commercial company (sociedade anónimas) established for the exclusive ----- purpose of carrying out securitization transactions in accordance with Decree-Law no. 453/99, of November 5, 1999 (the “Securitization Law”). Hefesto is subject to the supervision of the CMVM and its incorporation was subject to prior authorization by the CMVM. The acquisition of qualifying holdings in Hefesto is subject to prior notification to the CMVM. The CMVM may oppose the proposed acquisition if it considers that the proposed acquisition does not contribute to sound and prudent management of the company. This also applies to the indirect acquisition of qualifying holdings. The Securitization Law provides that members of the board of directors and members of the supervisory board must be registered with the CMVM and must meet certain standards as regards their professional qualifications and personal reputation. Hefesto carries out securitization transactions by means of the acquisition of loans and the issue of debt securities (securitization notes) to finance the payment of the purchase price for the acquired loans. The securitization notes are subscribed by investors and include our group and third-party investors. Once transferred to Hefesto, the loans constitute a segregate estate allocated exclusively to the issuance of the securitization notes, under a complete segregation of assets/liabilities principle (património autónomo), and will therefore only be available to satisfy the claims of the holders of the Notes (according to the applicable priorities) and other creditors of the Issuer do not have any right of recourse over the loans portfolio until there has been a full discharge of the Issuer’s liabilities towards the holders of the Notes and the other transaction creditors. The rights of the holders of the Notes regarding the payment of principal and interest (together with the rights of the other transaction creditors) rank senior to the rights of any other creditor of Hefesto in relation to the loans that back the relevant notes. The loans will therefore not be available to creditors of Hefesto other than the holders of the Notes (and other transaction-related creditors) until there has been a full discharge of the Issuer’s liabilities towards the noteholders and the other transaction creditors. The holders of the Notes are also not entitled to claim against Hefesto’s own funds or the assets backing other notes issued by Hefesto. Whitestar acts as servicer for securitization transactions made under the Securitization Law and is to such extent also subject to supervision by the CMVM. The Securitization Law provides that whenever the originator is a credit institution, servicing of the securitized loans shall in principle be carried out by the originator on behalf of Hefesto. However, in duly justified cases, the CMVM may authorize that servicing to be carried out by an entity other than the originator, such as Whitestar. Such authorization will depend on the evaluation of systems and experience of the servicer. Our purchase of non-paying loan portfolios from Portuguese credit institutions generally are not considered to constitute a regulated activity in Portugal and, together with our engagements of local agencies, fall under the general rules of the Portuguese Civil Code. Portuguese laws applicable to consumer loan agreements (including the transposed EU Directive described above), such as consumer credit regulations, prohibition on agreements being on unfair terms and other statutory requirements continue to apply to the Portuguese loan portfolios even after we have acquired them. The collection process in Portugal involves bringing judicial proceedings, and courts might strike down certain clauses of the relevant credit agreements that ----- are considered to be in breach of consumer credit regulations and other local statutory requirements, or deemed to be unfair terms. We must comply with local law on personal data being, the GDPR, Law no. 58/2019 of August 8, which ensures the implementation in Portugal of the GDPR, and Law no. 41/2004 of August 18, which implements in Portugal the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC). Norfin is authorized to manage undertakings for collective investment in property by CMVM which supervises its activity and is subject to the local implementation of AIFMD and additional local regulation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The 4th,17.100.3,The Netherlands,"In the Netherlands, in order to act as an intermediary in respect of consumer credit and/or mortgage credit and to offer consumer credit and/or mortgage credit (including activities relating to the servicing of existing credit agreements granted by third parties), we must have and maintain licenses granted by the AFM and the Vesting Group entities that have such licenses must comply with ongoing requirements and rules of conduct. These ongoing requirements include: (i) suitability and reliability of the (co)-policymakers; (ii) the competence of certain key employees; and (iii) ethical management (integere bedrijfsvoering). The licensed Vesting Group entities also are required to follow certain rules of conduct and should, among others, be affiliated with the Office for Credit Registration (Bureau Krediet Registratie) and a qualified dispute authority (geschilleninstantie) and keep proper administrative records of complaints. Failure to meet these requirements can result in AFM disciplinary actions or sanctions such as an instruction (aanwijzing) to adopt a certain course of action, an order for incremental penalty payments (last onder dwangsom) or an administrative fine (boete). The AFM may impose other specific sanctions including, but not limited to, resignation of one or more managing directors or revocation of the license. Additionally, failure to meet certain of these requirements, including licensure, could amount to a criminal offense pursuant to the Economic Offenses Act (Wet _economische delicten). Vesting Group_ The Vesting Group includes Dutch entities that are subject to the AFM regulatory framework. One of these entities holds a license allowing it to grant and act as an intermediary with respect to consumer credit and mortgage credit, and another one of these entities holds a license allowing it to grant consumer credit. Additionally, a number of Dutch entities have been registered as an “affiliated entity” (aangesloten instelling) of the Dutch company holding a license to grant and act as an intermediary with respect to consumer credit and mortgage credit. The licensed Dutch company is responsible for the affiliated entities’ compliance with the rules of conduct and instructions given by the AFM. Each affiliated entity should be affiliated with the Office for Credit Registration (Bureau Krediet Registratie). _Guidelines_ In November 2016, the AFM published guidelines in relation to consumer credit and debt collection servicers (Leidraad: Consumenten en Incassotrajecten). The AFM provided guidelines on the responsibilities of consumer credit providers in case of payment delays and certain other ----- risks associated with the sale and transfer of consumer credit receivables or credit agreements. In such cases, according to the guidelines, the consumer credit lender must secure the interests of its client after such transfer. Such measures should be contractually secured in the case of transfer of the receivables or credit agreement. Consumer credit lenders are not required to follow the guidelines and may use other solutions to focus on clients’ interests in case of payment delays in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. _Data protection_ We are required to comply with the data protection regulatory framework provided by the GDPR, as well as associated rules, regulations and guidance issued by the relevant regulators on national and European level. The data protection regulatory framework imposes rules and restrictions on companies with respect to the processing of personal data. Under these rules, personal data may only be processed in a fair, lawful and transparent manner. This means the requirement (among others) that personal data must be accurate and up to date, and may only be processed for legitimate purposes and not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Also, the processing of personal data must be limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of the processing. This includes for example storage limitation requirements. Furthermore, companies are required to take appropriate security measures to protect the personal data against loss (in a broad sense). Where third parties are being involved in the processing of personal data, or where personal data is being transferred to other countries, appropriate (contractual) arrangements must be put in place in accordance with the requirements laid down in the data protection regulatory framework. Failure to comply with the data protection regulatory framework can result in administrative fines (under the GDPR up to €20 million or up to four percent of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher), as well as criminal charges, breach of contract and damages actions, prohibitions on processing personal data, and reputational damage.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The 4th,17.100.4,Italy,"The Zenith Group’s main business is carrying out servicing activity in Italy, including: management and collection of receivables; cash and payment services in relation to securitizations; and assessment of compliance of securitization transactions with the applicable regulatory framework, jointly with other non-regulated activities. For this reason, the Zenith Group is subject to regulation under Article 106 of Legislative Decree September 1, 1993, No. 385, as amended (the “Italian Banking Act”). Before granting authorization under Article 106, the Bank of Italy carries out an assessment of the applicant and its business plan, including, among others, the integrity, fairness and professional requirements that the members of the corporate bodies must meet; the shareholding structure; the financial soundness and the business plan. After obtaining the necessary authorization, financial intermediaries are subject to ongoing supervision by the competent ----- authorities and are required to comply with various regulatory requirements concerning the following matters, among others: - _Prudential capital requirements: Certain provisions of EU Regulation No. 575/2013, as amended, concerning own funds apply; different prudential ratio apply depending on the type of activities which are carried out (for example, intermediaries that collect deposits are subject to stricter rules). - _Approval requirements for the acquisition of qualified shareholdings: The direct or indirect acquisition of a controlling stake, a considerable stake (i.e., a stake ascribing voting rights or a share capital of at least 10%, 20%, 30% or 50%), or a stake enabling the holder to exercise a significant influence over the intermediary’s management is subject to prior authorization from the Bank of Italy. - _Corporate governance: The members of corporate bodies are required: to have adequate experience in the financial sectors, to be without a criminal record, to be independent of family or professional connections with members of other corporate bodies, and to not hold similar offices in competing companies. Moreover, the corporate governance model must ensure the efficiency and fairness of the management and the effectiveness of the internal controls. - _Policies and procedures concerning internal audit, risk management and outsourcing: The internal controls must consist of rules, processes and policies that ensure compliance of the business with the applicable laws and regulations and that entail assessment of the suitability of the overall internal control system and the IT infrastructure on an ongoing basis. - _Supervisory reporting: The Bank of Italy performs its supervisory tasks through an extensive analysis of the information periodically provided (statistical, accounting and administrative). Failure to meet these requirements typically results in the Bank of Italy taking disciplinary action, such as special inspections (in addition to the routine inspections that the authorities periodically carry out) and other types of assessments, which can result in criminal and administrative sanctions and, in the case of major breaches, revocation of the firm’s authorization. Specifically, the authorization can be revoked for the following reasons: serious irregularities in the management of the intermediary or serious breaches of applicable law, regulations or statutory provisions; expected serious capital losses; and justified requests of revocation from the management bodies, the shareholders (i.e., the resolution at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting), and/or the special administrator or liquidator. The revocation of the authorization entails the winding up of the intermediary. During the winding up, which is governed by an ad hoc program, the Bank of Italy can authorize intermediaries to continue doing business on a pro-tempore basis, when required by specific circumstances that are assessed on a case-by-case basis. If the Bank of Italy determines an orderly liquidation is not possible, it may place the financial intermediary under compulsory administrative liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa). Compulsory administrative liquidation entails, ----- among others, the dissolution and replacement of the corporate bodies and the appointment of a monitoring committee by the Bank of Italy. The Bank of Italy is also entitled to carry out inspections to assess compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements, including in relation to the accuracy of the data provided, and/or to gain deeper knowledge of the intermediary and its business operations. If more areas for improvement are identified, the Bank of Italy can issue specific recommendations on the measures to be adopted; it then carries out a follow-up inspection to monitor progress. Conversely, if an irregularity or breach of applicable regulations is discovered, the Bank of Italy can begin a sanctioning procedure against the legal entity and/or the corporate officers deemed liable for the irregularity/breach.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Pursuant to the terms of the Irish CSA 2015, certain",17.101.1,,"borrowers of regulated entities (whose loans are sold) are afforded the same protection to which they would have been entitled had their loans not been sold. The Irish CSA 2015 makes certain amendments to the Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2015 (the “CBAs”) and the Consumer Credit Act 1995 (the “Irish CCA”). The Irish CSA 2015 amended the CBA 1997 to expand the definition of “regulated financial service providers” to encompass a new type of regulated entity, namely credit servicing firms. A further amendment to the CBA 1997 was made by way of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 (the “Irish CSA 2018”) which had the effect of requiring otherwise unregulated legal title holders of credit agreements to also become authorized as credit servicing firms. Credit servicing firms come within the definition of “regulated business” under the CBA 1997, as amended by the Irish CSA 2015 and Irish CSA 2018, and are therefore required under the CBA 1997 to obtain authorization from the CBI in order to provide credit servicing activities (as outlined below). A credit servicing firm includes (i) a person who (a) undertakes credit servicing other than on behalf of a regulated financial service provider authorized, by the CBI or an authority that performs functions in an EEA country that are comparable to the functions performed by the CBI, to provide credit in Ireland, or (b) holds the legal title to credit granted under a credit agreement in respect of which credit servicing is not being undertaken by a person authorized to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm, and (ii) is a regulated financial services provider authorized to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm in accordance with the CBA 1997. Under the CBA 1997, “credit servicing,” in relation to a credit agreement, means holding the legal title to credit granted under the credit agreement, managing or administering a credit agreement, including: (i) notifying the relevant borrower of changes in interest rates or in payments due under the credit agreement or other matters of which the credit agreement requires the relevant borrower to be notified; (ii) taking any necessary steps for the purposes of collecting or recovering payments due under the credit agreement from the relevant borrower; and (iii) managing or administering any of the following: - repayments under the credit agreement; - any charges imposed on the relevant borrower under the credit agreement; ----- - any errors made in relation to the credit agreement; - any complaints made by the relevant borrower; - information or records relating to the relevant borrower in respect of the credit agreement; - the process by which a relevant borrower’s financial difficulties are addressed; - any alternative arrangements for repayment or other restructuring; - assessment of the relevant borrower’s financial circumstances and ability to repay under the credit agreement; - determination of the overall strategy for the management and administration of a portfolio or credit agreement; and - maintenance of control over key decisions relating to such portfolio. Under the CBA 1997, “credit servicing” also includes communicating with relevant borrowers in respect to any of the above listed matters. _Consumer Protection in Ireland_ The Consumer Protection Act 2007 of Ireland (the “CPA”) came into force in 2007. The CPA implements the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive in Ireland. Under the CPA, there are four principal heads of offenses: Unfair Commercial Practices, Misleading Commercial Practices, Aggressive Commercial Practices and Prohibited Commercial Practices. In respect of most offenses (other than, for example, pyramid selling schemes), the CPA contains a defense of “due diligence.” This defense is available where the accused proves the commission of the offense was due to a mistake or the reliance on information supplied to the accused or to the act or default of another person, an accident of some other cause beyond the accused’s control, and that the accused exercised due diligence and took all reasonable precautions to avoid the commission of the offense. Due diligence means the standard of special skill and care which a trader may reasonably be expected to exercise towards consumers, commensurate with honest market practice and/or the general principle of good faith in trader’s field of activity. Under the CPA, both civil proceedings and criminal proceedings may be brought against a trader engaging in an unfair act or practice albeit this should not impact on the enforceability of the underlying contract itself. Any affected person, including consumers, other traders, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (“CCPC”) may bring civil proceedings under the CPA for a prohibition order against a trader engaging in an unfair act or practice. The CCPC may also serve a compliance notice on a trader whom it considers to have engaged in an unfair commercial practice. A consumer aggrieved by an unfair commercial practice also has a right of action for damages. ----- The CCPC is also empowered to institute summary proceedings for breaches of the CPA relating to misleading, aggressive and prohibited practices. A trader found guilty of an offense on summary conviction will be liable to a fine not exceeding €3,000 and/or six months imprisonment for a first offense and a fine of €5,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment for subsequent offenses. Proceedings on indictment will be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions (the “DPP”). On a first conviction on indictment an offending trader may be fined up to €60,000 and/or 18 months imprisonment and subsequent convictions carry a fine of up to €100,000 and/or 24 months imprisonment. The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive is stated to be without prejudice to contract law and the rules of the validity, formation or effect of a contract. There is, as yet, no reported case law on the CPA. _Conduct of Business Rules applicable to Credit Servicing Firms Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears_ The CCMA is a legally binding code published by the CBI on the handling of mortgage arrears and pre-arrears. A pre-arrears case arises where a borrower contacts the relevant lender to inform them that he/she is in danger of going into financial difficulties and/or is concerned about going into mortgage arrears or when the relevant lender itself identifies that this is likely to occur. The CCMA applies to the mortgage lending activities of lenders to borrowers in respect of their primary residence or in respect of the only residential property in Ireland owned by the borrower and accordingly will apply to the activities of Mars Capital Ireland in its capacity as a credit servicing firm, in its servicing of such mortgages. The CCMA sets out what the lender must do when managing mortgage arrears and pre-arrears cases and provides for, among others, the actions a lender is required to take to address mortgage arrears before resorting to repossession of the relevant property. As the CCMA applies to borrowers in respect of their primary residence or where it is the only residential property owned by them in Ireland, the protections afforded by the CCMA should not apply to buy to let mortgages. _Consumer Protection Code_ The revised Consumer Protection Code (the “CPC”) came in to force in 2012 and was subsequently amended in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019. The Consumer Protection Code sets out how lending institutions must deal with personal consumers, who are defined as natural persons acting outside his/her business, trade or profession, and with consumers, who are natural persons or groups of natural persons acting for personal and/or business purposes or incorporated bodies having an annual turnover of €3 million or less in the previous financial year (provided that such body is not a member of a group of companies having a combined turnover of greater than the said €3 million). Mars Capital Ireland will be subject to compliance with the requirements of the CPC in its capacity as a credit servicing firm. The CPC does not apply to a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies, but it could apply to a mortgage not in respect of a primary residence, including a buy to let mortgage. ----- _Lending to Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)_ The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 were published in 2015. In 2016, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) (Amendment) Regulations 2016 were published (the “SME",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The SME Regulations replaced the existing SME Code, from July 1, 2016, for",17.102.1,,"regulated lenders. On January 25, 2018, further technical amendments to the SME Regulations were published concerning the definitions of SMEs and took effect immediately. Due to the introduction of new provisions in the SME Regulations in respect to the arrears management and complaints handling of SMEs, Mars Capital Ireland will be subject to compliance with the requirements of the SME Regulations in its capacity as a credit servicing firm if it is servicing SME loans originated after July 1, 2016. _Mars Capital Ireland_ In Ireland, in order to manage or service credit agreements in respect of consumer credit and/or mortgage credit (or post July 1, 2016, SME credit), Mars Capital Ireland must have and maintain an authorization granted by the CBI under Part V of the CBA 1997 (as amended by the Irish CSA 2015 and Irish CSA 2018) to provide credit servicing activities. In addition, Mars Capital Ireland must comply with statutory obligations under the GDPR and the Irish Data Protection Acts and any binding guidance and/or codes or practice issued by the DPC or the EDPB. _Anti-Money Laundering_ Mars Capital Ireland is a regulated financial service provider authorized under Irish law and so it is required to have policies, procedures and internal controls in place to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing, in order to comply with the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended (the “CJA 2010”) (which transposes Directive (EU) 2015/849 (as further amended by Directive (EU) 2018/843) into Irish law).",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Effective risk management is closely aligned to our strategic goal of building better financial futures, while our three lines of defense model enables all colleagues to own and manage risk in a manner, which supports well-informed decision-making with a view to mitigating risks. Our enterprise-wide risk management framework defines a common approach across the whole organization. The framework is based upon our three core risk categories: strategic, financial and operational, with related details cascading from these areas, and is continually monitored and reviewed to ensure it remains suitable for the size, scale and complexity of our business. This framework includes: - Embedding the three lines of defense throughout the firm; ----- - Ensuring clarity of roles and responsibilities; - The establishment of defined risk appetite levels; - Risk management aimed at understanding risks and enabling proportionate risk mitigation plans; - Controls to address new and emerging risks; - Recognition and maintenance of operational risk and resilience plans; and - Escalation and risk reporting.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

We continue to embed and mature risk management processes which effectively identify, report, measure and manage risk. Risk committees, within each jurisdiction that we operate, continue to be run independently and focus on our country-based regulatory status. This approach allows for risks to be raised and mitigated with accountability where it is needed. Key areas of our risk framework are covered by the risk and information security teams who discharge their responsibilities with strong policies and procedures dealing with, among other matters, enterprise and operational risk, investment and financial risk, regulatory compliance and cyber risk, information security and data privacy. Delivering on our commitments relies on the ability to successfully identify, assess, respond, monitor and report on risks and opportunities. There is an ongoing focus on the top risks which could impact the business, alongside horizon scanning and monitoring of macro, geopolitical and other emerging risks that may affect the business or wider sector in the future. People and infrastructure commitments are in place to support these processes, ensuring increased consistency across the Group. We believe that our risk culture, aligned to our values, is a commercial differentiator and our ability to deploy Group-wide or country-specific expertise, when required, is a core element of our approach. The ongoing investment in a risk management system facilitates the evolution of our risk culture, helping to support a proactive and consistent approach to the identification and management of risks. Notably, it provides transparency and allows for actions across all three lines of defense to be addressed promptly and managed to completion via a single data source, with additional oversight through the risk committee structure, audit committee and via local regulated board meetings to gather additional insights on their respective control environments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

This has been particularly evident with the establishment of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime in the UK, which has provided rigor to the structured approach already adopted. It has formalized the basis around which decisions are taken and executed whilst ensuring we maintain a focus on customer conduct issues throughout all parts of the business. This is an approach that runs through our culture and values and is, therefore, evident in our businesses, which operate in different regulatory regimes. A summary of the roles and responsibilities relevant to each of the three lines of defense model are shown below: _First line business owners_ - Responsible for ownership and accountability of risk management; - Day-to-day ownership, management and reporting of risks; - First line implementation and quality control to ensure adherence to risk framework and processes; and - Responsible for control environment. _Second line risk and compliance_ - Provide oversight and challenge; - Act as a business partner and regulatory interface by way of providing advice, consultation and communication; - Develop and maintain risk framework and partnership with first line business owners; and - Provide oversight, monitoring and challenge to provide assurance to relevant boards and governance forums. _Third line internal audit_ - Provide independent assurance through formal reviews; and - Review and challenge the first and second lines of defense. The third line defense internal audit activity is delivered by the Group Head of Internal Audit with support from country audit teams and an external outsource provider, Deloitte LLP. The Group Head of Internal Audit reports to the audit committee, which ensures a clear distinction ----- between responsibilities in the second and third lines, and is an attendee at the Group Executive Risk Committee and the Risk Committee.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.103,Our Risk Management and Compliance,17.103.4,Risk-related focus risk during 2020,"The assessment and management of risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic dominated the risk management agenda in 2020. Due to the wide-ranging nature of the risks posed, these elements have been addressed across all areas of the risk profile, including, at different stages, those that related to our customers, clients, colleagues, financial risks or investment strategy. See “Risk Factors—Other Risks Relating to our Operations— _Our business, financial condition, cash _flows and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID- 19 pandemic.”_ In addition, the following areas were of particular focus during 2020: _Development of the Fund and Investment Management business_ Risk and compliance teams were fully involved throughout the process of launching and developing the Fund and Investment Management business in line with our stated ambition to realize opportunities to deploy third-party capital. In 2020, our focus was on investment risk appetite monitoring and reporting with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring regulatory compliance matters were addressed with internal and external experts working in tandem, enhancing processes to support the operating model, and ensuring governance and delegated authorities were restructured to meet the new requirements. _Brexit_ We maintained a watching brief on Brexit developments during 2020, whilst continuing to benefit from our multi-jurisdictional base provided by our existing footprint. Whilst this meant cross-border regulatory issues were less challenging given our individual country-based permissions and relationships, Brexit still posed a risk to data flows as well as the impacts on working and travel arrangements for colleagues. The COVID-19 pandemic may have reduced the immediacy of the latter’s challenge, however it was still prevalent, with targeted information provided to colleagues on the implications of Brexit for them and their personal circumstances. We continued to take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves based on the work of internal subject matter experts supported by external advisors. The individual operating licenses held by our individual businesses, alongside our balance sheet strength, meant that we were well positioned to navigate a range of Brexit outcomes. See “Risk Factors—Other Risks Relating to our Operations— _Legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the nature of the future relationship between the UK and the European Union is likely to be a source of instability in international markets, could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our business and result in new regulatory challenges and costs.” Regulatory scrutiny_ Our widespread footprint, both geographically and in terms of asset class coverage, means that we experience a broad spread of regulatory interactions across our compliance framework. This involves all parts of the business, both functionally and at all levels, which means strong ----- engagement and deep understanding of our regulatory role as well as colleagues’ individual responsibilities. Regulatory compliance is one of the pillars of our business; learning from the bestin-class across the Group to develop and achieve the same standards in all businesses and placing the customer journey and customer impact assessments at the heart of how we operate. Whilst other regulators move progressively towards the approach, standards and framework of the FCA in the UK, we are well placed to meet and surpass these standards elsewhere because of the approach we already adopt. The embedding of the Senior Manager and Certification Regime during 2020 is a prime example of this approach that was adopted at Group level. While we continue to maintain full focus on future developments from the Debt Respite Scheme Regulations in the UK to the Senior Executive Accountability Regime in Ireland and the AML Directives which affect all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. COVID-19 brought the treatment of customers, and especially those who may be more vulnerable, into sharp focus for all organizations. For us, this represented a continuation of our approach to treating customers fairly and responding to individual needs and so we were well positioned to work with our customers and regulators as the pandemic evolved. _Information security and operational resilience_ A fundamental area of operational risk management and operational resilience is our approach to information security. We benchmark our minimum information security standards against the international standard of good practice for information security, ISO 27001. Our framework involves identifying our critical data and applying the relevant protection controls to safeguard such data. We acknowledge, however, that the cyber-risk landscape is continually evolving, and in response to this, we are investing in our people, processes and technology in order to protect our colleagues, customers and clients, as well as to strengthen our ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats. Given that cyber-attacks are inevitable, we continue to focus on deploying resources, training our personnel and building up our technological resilience. We utilize a number of systems, such as Netscope, Mimecast and Okta to respond to potential cyber threats made via the web and our internal email and authentication systems. Although cyber risk forms a critical component of our operational resilience and scenario testing, we acknowledge that it is not the only business disruptor that can have a significant impact on our operations. As such, the development and strengthening of our business operating model encompasses the development of our culture, processes and systems such that our business is best placed to perform in line with our strategy in the face of disruption, regardless of the source of such disruption. This holistic approach to the development of the systems involved in our business will enable us to anticipate, protect and plan for operation recovery. Our approach to business continuity for our IT infrastructure is to ensure that our systems are “always on,” enabled by our use of cloud-based data centers. As such, in the event of a system breakdown, we expect to be able to recover all systems within approximately two hours with only minimal transaction history data loss. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

TDR Capital takes an active role in overseeing the operations of its investments, working in partnership with management through board representation and professional support. To date, TDR Capital has completed multiple investments across the funds, business and financial services sectors. Some examples of current and prior TDR Capital investments include TDR’s successful investments in Lowell Group, LeasePlan and Phoenix Group. TDR Capital helped oversee the growth of Lowell Group, a debt purchaser of unsecured debt, as its owner from 2011 until 2015, and developed an in-depth understanding of the value drivers and regulation relevant to the industry. TDR Capital’s experienced team of investment professionals and operating partners has had a longstanding historical focus on financial services and business services, as evidenced by its March 2016 investment in LeasePlan, the world’s leading fleet management and driver mobility company.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Senior Parent Finance Documents and any Permitted Parent Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior Payment Default, a Senior Payment Default or a Second Lien Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior Parent Indenture or any Permitted Parent Financing Agreement, as applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Notes Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Documents; or (ii) the issue of a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors. _Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_ Neither the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer nor any other Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Senior Parent Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Document by the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “Restrictions _Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” even if its obligation to make_ such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions. The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Parent Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Super Senior/ Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice. ----- _Cure of Payment Stop_ If: (a) at any time following the issue of a Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior Payment Default or a Senior Payment Default, that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Super Senior Payment Default or Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and (b) the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Parent Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under any Senior Parent Finance Document or any Permitted Parent Financing Document and which would have been Permitted Senior Parent Payments but for that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice, a Super Senior Payment Default or Senior Payment Default, then any event or circumstance specified to be an “Event of Default” in any of the Debt Financing Agreements (an “Event of Default”) (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived, and any Senior Parent Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Parent Creditors or any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender. _Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_ The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Parent Creditors, the Senior Parent Debt Issuer and the Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Documents in accordance with their terms at any time (and subject only to any consent required under them). _Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_ Until the Primary Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group: (a) no Senior Parent Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require the enforcement of any security; and (b) no Senior Parent Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer under the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or Permitted Parent Financing Documents, except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “Permitted Senior _Parent Enforcement” provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need_ be taken except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action. ----- _Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_ Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Senior Parent Agents (on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors) may, after a Revolving Acceleration Event, a Senior Acceleration Event or a Permitted Second Lien Financing Acceleration Event, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the Senior Parent Creditors of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Revolving Liabilities, the Senior Liabilities, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities if: (a) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (b) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the Revolving Facility Agreement (in the case of the Revolving Liabilities), the relevant Senior Debt Documents (in the case of the Senior Liabilities), the relevant Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents (in the case of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities) (as applicable);

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors) may only require a Super Senior Liabilities Transfer and a Senior Liabilities Transfer if, at the same time, they require a transfer of hedging liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no Super Senior Liabilities Transfer or Senior Liabilities Transfer may be required to be made.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants. Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Book-Entry Interests in Regulation S Global Notes will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction. Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by applicable law, general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters.

In addition, in certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See also “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our financial profile, the Notes and the _Guarantees—The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes.

For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” The ability of Holders to realize the Collateral will be subject to various insolvency law limitations in the event of the security provider’s insolvency and various contractual limitations set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.

Since the Holders will not be a party to the Transaction Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Transaction Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable. The Security ----- Agent will agree to release a security interest created by the Transaction Security Documents at the direction of the Trustee that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Holders, in certain circumstances, will share in the ability to direct the Trustee to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Transaction Security Documents.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Parent in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral remaining after the payment of obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, Hedging Obligations or certain operating facilities (if any) or other super priority obligations would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders as well as any other obligations secured on a pari passu basis. By its nature, some or all the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to _our financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will have been granted as security for the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.”_ By accepting a Note, each Holder, will be deemed to have: - irrevocably appointed GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as Security Agent, in each case to act as its security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which the security agent is a party (including, without limitation, the Transaction Security Documents); - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which the Security Agent is a party, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly wire to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee or an authentication agent appointed by the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in an aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least £100,000 or €100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. ----- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the Change of Control Payment Date will be no earlier than 30 days from the date a notice of such Change of Control Offer is emailed. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchases or redeems the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the applicable series of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of the applicable series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of then-outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of the applicable series, as applicable, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. A Change of Control will result in a mandatory prepayment under the Revolving Facilities Agreement. Future debt of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Issuer, may prohibit the ----- Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or may require repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s and the Parent’s and its Subsidiaries’ then-existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our _financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees—We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.”_ In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Parent in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. Subject to the preceding paragraph, the principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes for any purpose. So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or its nominee), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any of its or their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book ----- entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.1,Certain United Kingdom Tax Issues,62.1.1,Interest on the Notes,"_Withholding Tax_ Interest on the Notes may be payable without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax provided the Notes are and remain listed on a “recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the “ITA”). The Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Securities such as the Notes will be treated for these purposes as listed on the Exchange if they are included in the Official List of the Exchange in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in EEA states and are admitted to trading on the Exchange. Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax where the Issuer (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is paid) reasonably believes at the time the payment is made that (i) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a UK resident company, (ii) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a ----- non-UK resident company that carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment and the payment is one that the non-UK resident company is required to bring into account when calculating its profits subject to UK corporation tax or (iii) the person to whom the payment is made is one of the further classes of bodies or persons, and meets any relevant conditions, set out in Sections 935-937 of the ITA, provided that, in each case, HMRC has not given a direction that the payment may not be made without that withholding or deduction. In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes for or on account of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) unless an applicable double tax treaty provides for a full exemption from (or a lower rate of) UK tax in relation to a Noteholder and HMRC has issued a direction to the Issuer to pay interest to that Noteholder without deduction of tax (or for interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double tax treaty). If an amount is withheld or deducted for or on account of UK income tax from a payment of interest on the Notes (e.g., if the Notes are not or cease to be listed on the Exchange and no other relief or exemption is available), Noteholders who are not resident in the UK may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double taxation treaty. Any premium payable on redemption of the Notes may be treated as a payment of interest for UK tax purposes and may accordingly be subject to the UK withholding tax treatment described above. The Notes may be issued at an issue price of less than 100% of their principal amount. Any discount element on any such Notes will not generally be subject to any withholding or deduction for or on account, of United Kingdom income tax. _Direct Assessment_ The interest and premium (if any) on the Notes is expected to have a UK source for tax purposes and accordingly may be chargeable to UK tax by direct assessment (including selfassessment) even where paid without withholding or deduction. However, where the interest and premium (if any) is paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK tax, the interest will not be assessed to UK tax in the hands of Noteholders (other than certain trustees) who are not resident for tax purposes in the UK, except where (i) the Noteholder carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency in the UK or, in the case of a corporate holder, carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the UK, and (ii) the interest and premium (if any) arises through or from, or the Notes are used or held by, that branch or agency or is received in connection with, or the Notes are attributable to, that permanent establishment (as applicable), in which case (subject to exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent) tax may be levied on the UK branch or agency, or permanent establishment. Noteholders should note that the provisions relating to additional amounts referred to in ""Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts"" above would not apply if HMRC sought to assess directly the person entitled to the relevant interest to UK tax. However exemption from, or reduction of, such UK tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation treaty. ----- _Payments by the UK Guarantors_ The UK withholding tax treatment of payments by the Guarantors under the terms of the Guarantees in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) is uncertain. In particular, such payments by the Guarantors may not be eligible for the exemptions from UK withholding tax described above in relation to payments of interest. Accordingly, if the Guarantors make any such payments and they have a UK source, these may be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%).",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

In addition to interest on the Notes (which includes any foreign tax withheld), you will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld. You may be entitled to deduct or credit any foreign tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any additional amounts) on a Note generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit (or deduction in lieu of such credit) under your particular circumstances. Interest on the Euro Notes will be payable in euro and interest on the Sterling Notes will be payable in pound sterling. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the interest received, determined by translating the euro or pound sterling (as applicable) received at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on such date. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment. If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if you are otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt, you may determine the amount of income ----- recognized with respect to such interest (including any additional amounts) in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average spot rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate of exchange on: - the last day of the accrual period, - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year, or - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. You should consult your tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election. In addition, if you use the accrual method of accounting upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize U.S. source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euro or pound sterling received at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

If you purchased your Note with euro or pound sterling, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro or pound sterling paid for such Note determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such purchase. If your Note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable disposition for euro or pound sterling, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro or pound sterling received based on the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. If you are a cash method taxpayer and the Notes are traded on an established securities market, euro or pound sterling paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. If you are an accrual method taxpayer, you may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of the Notes traded on an established ----- securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, you have held the Note for more than one year. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, derived with respect to capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized by you on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note would generally be treated as U.S. source gain or loss. A portion of your gain or loss may be treated as exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in euro or pound sterling on the date of purchase and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis U.S. holders, the settlement dates of such purchase or taxable disposition, provided the Note is traded on an established securities market). The amount of exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of a Note (with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

This summary deals only with the Notes that are held as capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) for U.S. federal income tax purposes by a U.S. holder (as defined below) who acquires the Notes upon original issuance at their initial offering price. As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; ----- - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person. This summary is based upon provisions of the Code, and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are different from those described below. This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation and does not address the effects of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or state, local, nonU.S. or other tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address: - tax consequences to U.S. holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or an investor in such entity), U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies; - tax consequences to U.S. holders holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion transaction or a straddle; - tax consequences to U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or - alternative minimum tax consequences, if any. If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership holding the Notes, you should consult your tax advisors. ----- If you are considering the purchase of the Notes, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other U.S. federal tax laws (such as estate or gift tax laws) and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, the fiduciary of a Plan should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws, including, without limitation, general fiduciary requirements of ERISA, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification, the requirement that a Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the Plan, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Laws. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of a Covered Plan by taking into account the Covered Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters discussed above under “Risk Factors” and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of the Notes. Governmental plans, certain church plans, non-U.S. Plans and other plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws.

629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Covered Plan and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or “disqualified persons”) having certain relationships to such Covered Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the Covered Plan ----- who engaged in such non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if the Notes are acquired with the assets of a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the agents, the Trustee, the lenders under the Issuer’s existing credit facility or any of their respective affiliates, is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of Covered Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a Note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by “independent qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 9560 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions effected by in-house asset managers) (“Investor-Based Exemptions”). There is also a statutory exemption that may be available under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code to a person investing in the Notes for adequate consideration (within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code) that is a party in interest or disqualified person solely because it is a service provider to a Plan or because of a relationship to such a service provider or both, provided that neither such person nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of the ERISA Plan involved in the transaction (the “Service Provider Exemption”). Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering acquiring Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that any of these Investor-Based Exemptions or the Service Provider Exemption or any other administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. Any insurance company proposing to invest assets of its general account in the Notes should consider the extent to which such investment would be subject to the requirements of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993), and the enactment of Section 401(c) of ERISA on August 20, 1996. In particular, such an insurance company should consider (i) the exemptive relief granted by the U.S. Department of Labor for transactions involving insurance company general accounts in PTCE 95-60 and (ii) if such exemptive relief is not available, whether its acquisition of the Notes will be permissible under the final regulations issued under Section 401(c) of ERISA. The final regulations provide guidance on which assets held by an insurance company constitute “plan assets” for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. The regulations do not exempt the assets of insurance company general accounts from treatment as “plan assets” to the extent they support certain participating annuities issued to ERISA Plans after December 31, 1998. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase all of the Notes sold under the Purchase Agreement if any of the Notes are purchased. The Purchase Agreement further provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

In addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. ----- Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” Each of the Initial Purchasers has represented, warranted and agreed that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA, received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and (ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the UK.

The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.

Under Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes prior to the delivery of the Notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+    , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes ----- or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Initial Purchasers will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our structure—There _may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days after the date on which the Issuer received the proceeds of the Offering and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or their respective affiliates (including the Notes). The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may receive allocations of the Notes (subject to customary closing conditions), which could affect future trading of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including ----- potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among others) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules of private international law; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive, on the merits and for a debt or definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that: - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy or the European Convention on Human Rights; - the U.S. judgment includes an assessment of damages that has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment is a judgment in respect of the same subject matter involving the same parties as previously determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales and is inconsistent with the earlier judgment of such court; ----- - the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; - the party against whom the judgment is to be enforced is not subject to the jurisdiction of English courts; or - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. However, a final and enforceable judgment rendered by the relevant federal or state court in the United States against any of the Dutch Guarantors with respect to its payment obligations would generally be upheld and be regarded by a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction as conclusive evidence when requested to render a judgment in accordance with that judgment by the relevant federal or state court in the United States, without substantive re-examination or re litigation of the merits of the subject matter thereof, if the Dutch court finds that (i) the jurisdiction of the relevant federal or state court in the United States is based on international acceptable standards, (ii) the judgment was rendered in legal proceedings that comply with the standards of the proper administration of justice that includes sufficient safeguards (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) the recognition of that judgment does not contravene with Dutch public policy (openbare orde), and (iv) the judgment is not irreconcilable with a judgment of a Dutch court given between the same parties, or with an earlier judgment of a foreign court given between the same parties in a dispute involving the same cause of action and subject matter, provided that such earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for it to be given effect in the Netherlands.

Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in euros at the applicable rate of exchange.

In Guernsey, foreign judgments can be recognized by the Royal Court of Guernsey (the ”Guernsey Court”) either under the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Guernsey) Law, 1957, as amended (the “1957 Law”), which provides a statutory framework for the enforcement of judgments made in a reciprocating country and of a kind to which the 1957 Law applies, or under the principles of common law. Save for very exceptional and limited circumstances, if the 1957 Law does not apply then the common law prevails. For jurisdictions not included in the 1957 Law, including the U.S., a judgment obtained in a court in the U.S. against a Guernsey company (or its directors or officers) cannot be registered or enforced in Guernsey, pursuant to the 1957 Law, but may be enforceable by separate action on the judgment in accordance with Guernsey common law rules. To enforce the judgment of a court of the U.S. in Guernsey, the claimant would be required to bring fresh proceedings before the Guernsey Court, suing on the foreign judgment itself and applying for summary judgment if the case is placed on the pleadings list (essentially, where the case is defended). In such an action, the Guernsey Court is unlikely to re-examine the merits of the original case decided by a U.S. court. According to current practice, the Guernsey Court will (subject to the following matters) enforce the judgment of a court in the United States in in personam proceedings provided that the following conditions inter alia are satisfied: (a) the judgment is for a debt or fixed or ascertainable sum of money (provided that the judgment does not relate to U.S. penal, revenue or other public laws); (b) the judgment is final and conclusive; and ----- (c) the court in the U.S. had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the judgment debtor in accordance with the Guernsey rules of private international law. The Guernsey Court will not, however, enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the Guernsey Court that: (a) the judgment was given in proceedings that were in breach of principles of natural or substantial justice; (b) enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to Guernsey public policy; (c) the foreign court did not have jurisdiction to give that judgment according to Guernsey rules on the conflict of laws; (d) there was fraud on the part of the U.S. court pronouncing judgment; (e) there was fraud on the part of the party in whose favor the judgment was given; (f) enforcement proceedings are time barred under the Guernsey laws on prescription/limitation; (g) the foreign judgment is not for a definite sum of money (which is not a sum in respect of taxes or penalties) or is not final and conclusive; (h) the foreign judgment was against a person who was entitled to immunity from the courts of that country; and (i) the foreign court had no jurisdiction in circumstances where the judgment debtor was, at the time the proceedings were instituted, present in the foreign country and the bringing of proceedings in that U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute was to be settled and the judgment debtor did not agree to the proceedings being brought in that U.S. court, nor counterclaimed or otherwise submitted to the jurisdiction. If the Guernsey Court gives judgment for the sum payable under a judgment of a United States court, the Guernsey judgment would be enforceable by the methods generally available for the enforcement of Guernsey judgments. These give the Guernsey Court discretion whether to allow enforcement by any particular method. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain a Guernsey judgment or to enforce any Guernsey judgment: if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvent administration or similar proceedings; if there is delay; if an appeal is pending or anticipated against the Guernsey judgment in Guernsey or against the foreign judgment in the courts of the United States; or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in Portugal, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The U.S. and Portugal currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state ----- court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Portugal. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Portugal, the claim must be re-litigated before a Portuguese court. The competent court for the review and confirmation in Portugal of a foreign decision is the Portuguese Court of Appeal with jurisdiction in the area where the person against whom the foreign decision is to be enforced is domiciled. However, a final and enforceable judgment rendered by the relevant federal or state court in the United States against each of Whitestar Asset Solutions, S.A. or AGHL Portugal Investments Holdings, S.A. with respect to their payment obligations would generally be upheld and be regarded by a Portuguese court of competent jurisdiction as conclusive evidence when requested to render a judgment in accordance with that judgment by the relevant federal or state court in the United States, without substantive reexamination or re-litigation of the merits of the subject matter thereof, if the following requirements are verified: (i) the judgment is final, translated into Portuguese and apostilled and no doubts exist about the authenticity of the document and the contents of the judgment; (ii) the judgment shall not be contrary to Portuguese public policy and the obligation that the petitioner tries to execute has to be lawful in Portugal; (iii) there shall not be a pending proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same issues in Portugal; (iv) there shall not be a judgment rendered between the same parties and for the same cause of action in Portugal or in another country; (v) the matters under discussion are not related to matters in which the Portuguese courts consider themselves exclusively competent and the competency of such foreign courts is not obtained by unlawfully circumventing applicable rules; and (vi) the rights of defense of the defendant should have been protected when rendering the foreign judgment (princípio do _contraditório), including but not limited to a proper service of process carried out with sufficient_ time for the defendant to prepare its defense and appear before the courts and notification (citação), and with respect for the principle of equal treatment of the parties. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in Portugal judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Portuguese court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in Portugal and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in Portugal will be subject to the rules of Portuguese civil procedure.

As a result, a reference in this Offering Memorandum to the EU Insolvency Regulation as it applies to the UK is to be read, on or after Exit Day, as a reference to such EU regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended) (the “EUWA”) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time be, amended, modified or re-enacted by domestic law and shall include any subordinate legislation made from time to time under that EU regulation, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA. On Exit Day, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the UK continued to be treated as a member state of the EU, including for the purpose of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Following the transition period, the UK ceased to be treated as a member state of EU. The EU Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 and the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019) (the “Insolvency Amendment Regulations”) such that the provisions regarding mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings under the EU Insolvency Regulation, providing for the automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in other Member States, no longer apply. However, the EUWA provided for the EU Insolvency Regulation to continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided that the main proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the EU Insolvency Regulation will not continue to apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP Day. ----- Therefore, and provided that the main proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will continue to recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in other Member States, and will receive reciprocal recognition of UK insolvency proceedings. The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day) came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the UK. In addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, the post-IP Day EU Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the UK in respect of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of rescue, adjustment of debt, reorganization or liquidation and: - the debtor’s center of main interests (“COMI”) is in the UK; or - the debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the UK. These tests are consistent with the EU Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper jurisdiction for a debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those proceedings. However, the Insolvency Amendment Regulations extend the UK court’s jurisdiction (i) provided the court considers there to be a sufficient connection with England and Wales (and that (A) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (B) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction), to wind up any foreign company which might be wound up as an unregistered company under UK insolvency laws, even if its COMI is in a Member State and it has no establishment in the UK; and (ii) to place a company incorporated in an EEA state, or having its COMI in a Member State, into administration. While the English courts can assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings on these bases, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and _restructuring proceedings”)._",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The courts of England and Wales would have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings, based on English insolvency laws, over an English company. In addition, the UK Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”) in Great Britain and which apply to foreign insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions) anywhere in the world without any condition of reciprocity, provide that certain collective foreign (i.e., nonEnglish) proceedings in respect of an English company may be recognized by the English courts ----- as foreign main proceedings where it has its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non main proceedings where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Should any English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court). Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways. These include, in the case of administration, the company, its directors or a creditor making an application to court for an administration order, or the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) granted by the company and which has become enforceable appointing an administrator out of court, or, in the case of liquidation, by a creditor filing a petition at court to wind up the company or the company resolving by special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. On the Issue Date, the obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantees and the Notes will be secured by security interests over the Initial Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against an English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities) in each case under Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of three weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable or if the following would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on Insolvency”). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as defined herein) granted by the company and which has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). The entitlement of the floating charge holder(s) to receive the proceeds of the realization of the relevant property will be subject to any prior ranking claims in the statutory order of priority, (see “—Priority on Insolvency” ). An administrator may also, with the prior approval of the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies (i) the net proceeds from the disposal; and (ii) any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realized on a sale of the property at market value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such ----- time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or ten business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (see further below). If an English company were to enter administration, whether it would be possible to enforce any security granted by it while the company was in administration without permission of the court or consent of the administrator would depend on whether such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A demand for payment could be made under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against the company in connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, or the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into administration, the Notes and the Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced (save to the extent that the Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement) while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge granted by the company and which has become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. In order to empower the chargee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act). This will apply if an English obligor incurs a debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument) as well as fulfilling certain other technical requirements. If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a ----- qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The chargee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other carveouts, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered by the charge and therefore whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of a company’s property.” Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020) (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge realizations exceed £10,000, the court grants an order on the application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/ 3226)), as set out below. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question, together with any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realized on a sale of the property at market value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to be created by an English law governed security document as properly taking effect as floating charges; as the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests purporting to be fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a ----- purported fixed security interest in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee in the ordinary course, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests, (a) the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

An English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents include (whether at the outset or following an amendment in accordance with the terms of the documents) an English governing law and/or jurisdiction clause. Further, a number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an existing or newly incorporated English company to assume primary liability (through various means) for financial obligations of the group for the sole purpose of creating the requisite nexus to pursue a scheme (in which the obligations of the existing obligors would be varied). Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional requirements would be satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such creditors are given under or in connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of those entitled to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration.

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reduction of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of decision procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who were or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential creditors, except with its consent. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. As noted above, the company’s shareholders will also vote on the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the decision of the creditors differs from the decision of the shareholders, the former will prevail unless a shareholder applies to court within 28 days and the court orders that the decision of the shareholders should prevail. Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

In the case of compulsory liquidation, even if a foreign company has neither its COMI or an establishment in the UK, it may be wound up as an unregistered company if the court considers there to be (i) a sufficient connection with England and Wales, (ii) a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (iii) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise a jurisdiction. Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on Insolvency”). Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding- up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, whether members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). The key difference between the two types of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations (as defined herein) and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. ----- In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, legislation was introduced which temporarily restricts the ability of creditors to present winding-up petitions (and previously restricted courts from granting winding-up orders). With effect from October 1, 2021, the temporary restrictions previously in place expired and were replaced by new more limited regulations (set out in Schedule 10 of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, as amended by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Amendment of Schedule 10) (No.2) Regulations 2021). These introduced temporary targeted measures to limit the use of winding-up petitions. These measures: (a) raise the threshold upon which a winding up petition may be presented from £750 to £10,000; (b) allow a creditor to present a winding up petition only after expiry of a 21-day period during which the debtor has failed to provide a proposal for repayment satisfactory to the creditor following service of the requisite notice by the creditor; and (c) prevent landlords petitioning to wind up tenants for unpaid rent arrears (or any other amount that a tenant is liable to pay under a lease) arising as a result of coronavirus. The measures will remain in place until March 31, 2022. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will also be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security). A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which encapsulates any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or debt as a debt in the winding-up. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,893,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEES AND SECURITY AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,893.1,England and Wales,893.1.13,Priority on Insolvency,"One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors. In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as at the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of setoff, including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency set-off applies). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest only; - Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and within the subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any priority premoratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting ----- in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they are paid; - Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include VAT, PAYE income tax, employee national insurance contributions and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors; - Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was recharacterized as a floating charge; - Seventh ranking: `o` firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security; `o` secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or ----- the Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and `o` thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This, however, does not include “currency conversion” claims following English Supreme Court’s ruling dated May 17, 2017 on the Lehman Brothers case; and - Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. See “—Administration and Floating Charges” above for a description of the Prescribed Part.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842
629_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,893,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEES AND SECURITY AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,893.1,England and Wales,893.1.14,Avoidance of Transactions,"There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security or guarantees (amongst other corporate actions) can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company enters administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) after the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he or she may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company. Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of action (including their proceeds) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it. _Onset of Insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an administration order is submitted, (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date on which the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences will be as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ A connected person, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director, or an associate, of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are: (i) ----- the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; or (ii) a relative of the individual; or (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; or (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (v) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company. A person is an associate of any person with whom they are in partnership, and of the husband, wife or civil partner or a relative of any individual with whom they are in partnership. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees and security interests: _Transaction at an Undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or the guarantee was granted within the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and the connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings. In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. ----- If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside any security interests granted of guarantees, although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). An order by the court may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) except where that person was a party to the transaction or the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or guarantee was granted within the period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency. If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees), subject to the same principles as are described above with respect to transactions at an undervalue. However, the court will only make such an order if it is shown that, in deciding to give the preference, the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and that it was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence (it is not open to the connected person to rebut the presumption of insolvency). ----- _Transaction Defrauding Creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (as outlined above) and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by any appointed administrator or liquidator, the supervisor of any relevant CVA or, subject to certain conditions, the FCA, PRA and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time or as a result of the transaction, or in administration or liquidation for the provision to apply. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he or she is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate Credit Transaction_ An administrator or a liquidator company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. Where an administrator or liquidator (or their assignee) makes an application to set aside a transaction on this basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third ----- parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it). _Grant of Floating Charge_ Under English insolvency law, if (i) a floating charge is granted by an English company within the period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency and (ii) at the time of granting the floating charge or as a consequence thereof, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act), then such floating charge will be invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest). The requirement for the English obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. No application to court by an administrator or liquidator (or any other person) is required to invalidate (in part or in full) the relevant fixed charge; this will happen automatically if the statutory requirements are fulfilled. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended), the floating charge will not be invalidated on this basis.

Financial collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash,",893.2.1,Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020,"On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the “Act”) enacted fundamental reforms to the UK’s existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include (but are not limited to) the following: _(a)_ _Moratorium_ The Act introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). From October 1, 2021, ineligible companies also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Guarantors are likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time. Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. From October 1, 2021, directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium. Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately ----- confirm (among other things) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium. During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The Act includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration and floating charges,” “—Grant _of floating charge” and “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003” above)_ or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority premoratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course. A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying ----- conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan). _(b)_ _Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_ The Act introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses, and the imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include a company voluntary arrangement, winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, save to the extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate the contract arose before commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency proceeding, comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during the relevant insolvency proceeding that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents, or if the court permits (where it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this new prohibition. _(c)_ _Restructuring Plan_ The Act also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006, but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to ----- the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company). Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties” test falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e. unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring plans (unlike schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent to determine whether the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class composition test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised under the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company. The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or members (or classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or class of creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the plan without their consent. Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring ----- plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (a) the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the restructuring plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e. what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and (b) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of that “relevant alternative” scenario. A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in favor of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration (or, in the case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in the Gazette). _(d)_ _So-called “Henry VIII” powers_ The Act (as amended by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Change of Expiry Date) Regulations 2021) further confers on the UK government some extensive powers to make a range of further amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations until April 29, 2022. For example, regulations may be made to amend or modify the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to change or disapply a person’s corporate duties and liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court. Accordingly, in the event that an English obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk in respect of the non-sterling amount proved between the date on which such English obligor goes into liquidation or administration and the date of receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled. The English Supreme Court’s ruling in the Lehman Brothers case established that any such holder of the Notes would not be entitled to make a claim for any losses suffered by them as a result of a fall in the value of pounds sterling between the “relevant date” and the date of any distribution. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction.

Financial collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash,",893.2.8,Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings,"_General position_ The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions. One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the Model Law, which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and the UK, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain UK insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the UK) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the UK) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in the UK of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are not regarded as insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Financial collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash,",893.2.9,,"financial instruments or credit claims. The definition of “financial instruments” includes shares in companies and debt instruments such as bonds and claims under loans made by credit institutions. The original primary purpose of the Financial Collateral Regulations was to implement Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002 on financial collateral arrangements (OJ 2002 L168/43) in the UK. The purpose of that directive was to simplify the process of taking financial collateral across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal framework. If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations, certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which (amongst other things) remove restrictions on enforcing security, disapply certain provisions relating to the order of payment of creditors in administration or liquidation and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency office holder of the financial collateral arrangement in certain situations. For ----- example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral Regulations apply are not required to be registered as a registrable charge at Companies House, and are not subject to the statutory moratorium on enforcement of security that would otherwise apply when a company enters into administration. Furthermore, the Financial Collateral Regulations enable the creditor holding the security interest to appropriate (i.e., to become the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral to which the security interest applies without the need for a court order provided the security interests have become enforceable in accordance with their terms and provided the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate in the relevant contract.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 17, 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties (the one case to date in which this point has been considered adopted the latter position). _Recognition in the EU_ Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the transition period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. ----- As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of either of the Jersey Guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: “en désastre” and winding up (including just and equitable winding up and creditors’ winding up). The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey (the “Royal Court”) under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of “en désastre,” title and possession of the property of the debtor vests automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With effect from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt. With effect from the date of declaration, a secured party may, however, without the consent of the Viscount and without an order of the Royal Court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence any legal proceedings or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the balance of the debt. ----- Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding up of an insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date of the declaration of “en désastre” and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract. A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the rights, interests and liabilities of the company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and discharges the company/Viscount from all liability in respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the declaration but shall not, except so far as is ----- necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing as a creditor in the “en désastre” or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim onerous property. In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating creditors’ claims may be set aside.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

On a creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors",893.5.5,Enforcement of security and security in insolvency,"Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have capacity to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the extent that any floating charge or other security interest governed by a foreign law is expressed to apply to any asset, property and undertaking of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating charge or other security interest is not likely to be held valid and enforceable by the Jersey courts in respect of Jersey situs assets. The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Jersey courts may not recognize the powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets. The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity, assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Royal Court think fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey. If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime. In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed as this is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. The Royal Court’s position may also not be in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/848 (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”). Jersey does not form part of the EU for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the Recast Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of center of main interests does not apply. Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an ----- undervalue, preferences, extortionate credit transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey. Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey law. The Jersey situs assets of H.I.J. Limited will be secured pursuant to Jersey law governed security interest agreements. The 2012 Law provides that a secured party may enforce security over intangible movable assets by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition, a secured party may take certain ancillary actions, including any bespoke enforcement powers included in a security agreement, to the extent not in conflict with the 2012 Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and taking one or more of the enforcement options specified above does not preclude the exercise of other rights of a secured party. The power of enforcement is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and written notice specifying the event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by way of sale or appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days’ prior written notice. Importantly, the grantor may agree in writing to waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale and it is usual to include such a waiver in the security agreement. The secured party is obliged on sale or appropriation, to give at least 14 days’ prior written notice to: (i) any person who, 21 days before the sale or appropriation, has a registered security interest in the collateral; and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral and has, not less than 21 days before the sale or appropriation, given the secured party notice of that interest unless, in each case, the secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing. There are specific carve-outs from the obligation to give notice of sale. On exercising the power of enforcement by appropriation or sale, the secured party must: (i) take all commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the collateral, as at the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner in relation to the appropriation or sale; and (iii) (in the case of a sale only) enter into any agreement for or in relation to the sale only on commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party is owed to the grantor and also to any other person to whom the secured party was required to give notice of sale or appropriation (whether or not they have agreed in writing to waive the notice requirements). If, in exercising its powers of enforcement, a secured party appropriates or sells collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give certain persons (any person with a registered subordinate security interest and certain persons claiming an interest in the collateral) a written statement of account setting out certain information in relation to that appropriation or sale. If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of appropriation or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt owed to the secured party, the secured party shall pay the amount of any resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in payment, in due order of priority, to any person who has a subordinate security interest in the collateral and has registered a financing statement over that security interest (where the registration remained effective immediately before the appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any other person (other than the grantor) who has given the secured party notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and in respect of which the secured party is satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in the collateral; and (iii) as to the balance (if any) in payment to the relevant debtor grantor. Alternatively, the secured party may discharge its obligation above with respect to any surplus by paying that amount into the Royal Court. The surplus may then only be paid out on the order of the court on application by a person entitled to the surplus. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Article 40 of the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law provides that the rules of,893.6.2,,"customary law applicable to partnerships shall apply to Jersey Limited Partnerships except in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law. There is no Jersey equivalent to the UK Partnerships Act 1890 and so Jersey partnership law is derived from the common or customary law applicable to general partnerships. Although a Jersey Limited Partnership is registered with the Registrar of Limited Partnerships in Jersey, the Jersey Limited Partnership is not a separate legal person nor a body corporate. Therefore all actions and proceedings against a Jersey Limited Partnership must be commenced against the general partner in its capacity as general partner of the Jersey Limited Partnership, and not against any limited partner or against the Jersey Limited Partnership itself (without reference to the general partner). As a Jersey Limited Partnership is not a separate legal person, its insolvency (defined in Article 2 of the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law as the general partner being unable to discharge the debts of the Jersey Limited Partnership as they fall due out of the assets of the Jersey Limited Partnership, without recourse to the general assets of the general partner) will not lead to the commencement of _en désastre or creditors’ winding up proceedings in respect of the Jersey Limited Partnership. Please see paragraph below for a summary of the provisions of the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law relating to dissolution of a Jersey Limited Partnership. However, assuming the general partner is the sole general partner of the Jersey Limited Partnership, given the unlimited liability of the general partner to meet the liabilities and obligations of the Jersey Limited Partnership, the insolvency of the general partner (by way of en _désastre or creditors’ winding up proceedings in respect of the general partner) will usually follow_ the insolvency of the Jersey Limited Partnership. The Jersey Limited Partnerships Law provides that a Jersey Limited Partnership shall be dissolved upon the dissolution, bankruptcy or withdrawal from the Jersey Limited Partnership of the sole or last general partner (but not, subject to the provisions of the Jersey Limited Partnership agreement, a limited partner). In such circumstances, the Jersey Limited Partnership shall be wound up in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement or on the application of a limited partner or a creditor of the Jersey Limited Partnership in accordance with the directions of the Royal Court. It should be noted that a Jersey Limited Partnership will not be wound up as referred to above if within 90 days of its dissolution, the limited partners (either unanimously or as provided for in the Jersey Limited Partnership agreement) elect one or more replacement general partners. In such circumstances, the Limited Partnership shall be deemed to not have been dissolved and the ----- activities of the Jersey Limited Partnership may be taken over and continued as provided for in the limited partnership agreement or a subsequent agreement. Under the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law, the Royal Court may order the dissolution of a Jersey Limited Partnership on the application of any partner if the Royal Court is satisfied that: (a) the Jersey Limited Partnership is being conducted in a manner calculated or likely to affect prejudicially the carrying out of the activities of the Jersey Limited Partnership; (b) the Jersey Limited Partnership is being conducted in a manner oppressive to one or more of the limited partners; or (c) circumstances have arisen which render it just and equitable that the Jersey Limited Partnership be dissolved. Where the Royal Court makes an order in accordance with this paragraph, it may give such directions as it thinks fit as to the winding up of the Jersey Limited Partnership. Upon the dissolution of a Jersey Limited Partnership, its affairs shall be wound up by the general partner unless the activities of the Jersey Limited Partnership are taken over and continued as referred to above or the Royal Court has given directions as to how the Jersey Limited Partnership should be wound up. The Jersey Limited Partnerships Law provides that the assets of a Limited Partnership shall be distributed in the following order after the dissolution of a Jersey Limited Partnership: (a) firstly, to the creditors (other than limited partners on account of their contribution or profit and general partners) of the Jersey Limited Partnership in satisfaction of the Jersey Limited Partnership’s debts; (b) secondly, to limited partners who are creditors and who are not also general partners in satisfaction of the Jersey Limited Partnership’s debts to them (other than debts described in paragraph (c) below); (c) finally, subject to the provisions of the limited partnership agreement, to the partners as follows: (i) firstly, to general partners other than for capital and profits; (ii) secondly, to limited partners in respect of the capital of their contributions; (iii) thirdly, to limited partners in respect of their share of the profits on their contributions; (iv) fourthly, to general partners in respect of capital; and (v) finally, to general partners in respect of profits. ----- The general insolvency and dissolution provisions under the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law relating to Jersey Limited Partnerships established in Jersey are subject to a number of specific exceptions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

This provision of Guernsey customary law may, in certain circumstances, be used by any person who claims to be the victim of the transaction, not only liquidators. If a court were to find that the granting of the Guarantee or the provision of security constituted a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such orders as it thinks fit to protect the interests of those creditors and to restore the Guarantor’s position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into, including by voiding the Guarantee and/or the security. There is not yet decisive case law as to what, if any, time limit there is on such a challenge.

A company is deemed to have given a preference to a person if that person is either one of the company’s creditors or a surety or Guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities, and the company does anything or permits anything to be done which improves that person’s position in the company’s liquidation. The Guernsey Court may not make an order regarding a preferential transaction unless it is satisfied that the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put that person in a better position in the company’s liquidation, save where the person given a preference is connected with the company where such desire is presumed unless the contrary is shown.

Désastre involves execution against a debtor’s movable assets in Guernsey and is most often employed against individuals, but could potentially be applied to companies. Saisie involves execution against a debtor’s real property situated in Guernsey. _Administration_ An administration order may be made in respect of a Guernsey company if the Guernsey Court is satisfied that a company does not satisfy or is likely to become unable to satisfy the “solvency test” prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, as amended and considers that the making of an administration order may achieve either: - the survival of the company, and the whole or any part of its undertaking, as a going concern; or - a more advantageous realization of the company’s assets than would be effected on a winding up. An administration order may be applied for by a company itself, the directors of the company, any member of the company, any creditor of the company (including any prospective or contingent creditor), the GFSC in respect of supervised companies and companies engaged in financial services business or, in the case of a company in respect of which the Guernsey Court has made an order for winding up or which has passed a resolution for voluntary winding up, a liquidator. In the period between the presentation of the application for an administration order and ending with the making of an order or the dismissal of the application: - no resolution may be passed or order made for the company’s winding up; and ----- - no proceedings may be commenced or continued against the company except with the leave of the Guernsey Court and subject to such terms and conditions as the Guernsey Court may impose. However, a creditor’s rights of set-off and security interests created pursuant to the Security Interests (Guernsey) Law, 1993 and rights of enforcement thereof are unaffected and may be exercised without the leave of the Guernsey Court. In addition, the leave of the Guernsey Court is not required for the presentation of an application for the company’s winding up in that period. Following the making of an administration order and during the period for which the administration order is in force, the affairs, business and property of a company are managed by an administrator appointed by the Guernsey Court, and no resolution may be passed or order made for the company’s winding up and no proceedings may be commenced or continued against the company except with the consent of the administrator or the leave of the Guernsey Court and subject to such terms and conditions as the Guernsey Court may impose. However, a creditor’s rights of setoff and security interests created pursuant to the Security Interests (Guernsey) Law, 1993, and rights of enforcement thereof are unaffected. _Winding up_ A Guernsey company may be wound up voluntarily if: - the period (if any) fixed by its memorandum or articles of incorporation for the duration of the company expires, provided that the company passes an ordinary resolution that it be wound up voluntarily; or - an event (if any) occurs on the occurrence of which the memorandum or articles of incorporation of the company provide that the company must be dissolved, provided that the company passes an ordinary resolution that it be wound up voluntarily; or - if the company passes a special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily. From the commencement of a voluntary winding up (which occurs upon the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding up), the company must cease to carry on business, except insofar as may be expedient for the beneficial winding up of the company. The company, however, continues in existence until dissolution. Arrangements can be entered into between a Guernsey company which is being voluntarily wound up and its creditors to delegate to its creditors the right to appoint a liquidator. Any arrangement entered into between a company and its creditors, subject to a right of appeal, is binding if sanctioned by a special resolution of the company and by 75% in number and value of its creditors. However, a creditor or shareholder of a company that has entered into such an arrangement may, within 21 days beginning on the date of the completion of the arrangement, apply to the Guernsey Court for an order that the arrangement be set aside. The Guernsey Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the setting aside, amendment, variation or confirmation of the arrangement. ----- A company may be compulsorily wound up by the Guernsey Court if the company, among others: has by special resolution resolved that it be wound up by the Guernsey Court; has not commenced business within one year beginning on the date of its incorporation; suspends business for a whole year; has no members; or is unable to pay its debts. For this purpose, a company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if a creditor to whom the company owes a sum exceeding £750, which is due, serves on the company through the office of H.M. Sergeant at the company’s registered office a written demand for payment (commonly called a “statutory demand”), and the company, for a period of 21 days immediately following the date of service of the statutory demand, fails to pay the sum or to secure payment to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; or if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Guernsey Court that the company fails to satisfy the solvency test as prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, as amended. On the making of an application for the compulsory winding up of a company or at any time thereafter, any creditor of the company may apply to the Guernsey Court for an order restraining, on such terms and conditions as the Guernsey Court thinks fit, any action or proceeding pending against the company; or appointing a provisional liquidator to ascertain the company’s assets and liabilities, manage its affairs and do all acts authorized by the Guernsey Court.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Certain of the Guarantors have their corporate seat in the Netherlands (i.e., the Dutch Guarantors) and it is therefore presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) that they have their “center of main interests” in the Netherlands. Dutch insolvency laws may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to debtors (excluding natural persons). The first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, bankruptcy proceedings may also be used to sell the business, or parts of the business, as a going concern. As such, a bankruptcy could function as a restructuring procedure as well as a liquidation procedure. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. Furthermore, as of January 1, 2021, debtors have the possibility under a pre-insolvency regime plan to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings, see further under “—Dutch Scheme” below. An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, the court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a ----- provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium is made. If the composition is accepted and subsequently confirmed by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under Dutch law, secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, the court may order a “cooling down period” for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Further, in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority of the creditors being present or represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are admitted for voting purposes, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in Dutch moratorium of payments proceedings to the extent that the proceeds of the Dutch law security created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes are insufficient to satisfy their claims. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it is no longer able to pay its debts when due. The bankruptcy can be requested by the debtor itself or a creditor whose claim is due and payable but left unpaid; provided that there is at least one other eligible creditor or, in exceptional circumstances (e.g., for reasons of public interest), by the public prosecutor. If the court declares a debtor bankrupt, it will appoint a receiver (curator) (or several receivers, depending on the complexity of the proceedings) and a judge to supervise the insolvency proceedings. The receiver will realize the debtor’s assets and distribute the proceeds to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the statutory order of payment. The general principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and preferential creditors, including tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. As a general rule, claims of unsecured and non-preferential creditors will have to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy to be verified. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the debtor’s shareholders. Creditors of secured claims, such as the holders of the Notes, and preferential creditors with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject ----- to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset to which the relevant preferential right relates. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the receiver in bankruptcy determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings for the purpose of distribution of the proceeds. A claim with an uncertain due date or which entitles the creditor to periodic payments shall be admitted for its value at the date of the bankruptcy order. Claims which become payable within one year after the day the debtor is declared bankrupt shall be considered matured. Claims which become payable one year after the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings shall be admitted for their value one year from the date of the commencement of the bankruptcy. Claims having an indeterminate or uncertain value, or whose value is not expressed in Dutch currency or not expressed in monetary terms at all, shall be admitted for their estimated value in Dutch currency. Interest payments on claims existing at the time of the bankruptcy order that fall due after such time cannot be verified, unless secured by a pledge or mortgage. In such a case, interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that the interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the Notes may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the receiver in bankruptcy, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of any other claim that has been submitted for verification. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooi procedure). As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in a bankruptcy a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a simple majority of the creditors being present or represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are admitted for voting purposes, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may, to a certain extent, be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. However, the actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Secured creditors, such as the holders of the Notes, may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor that are subject to the security to satisfy their claims during a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, the court may order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of four months during which all recourse actions (including action to enforce security) by secured creditors (other than estate creditors (boedelschuldeisers)), are prohibited unless such creditors have obtained leave from the supervisory judge. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets. Failing enforcement before such deadline, the receiver is permitted to sell the secured asset. After such a sale, the former holder of the security right remains entitled to a prioritized claim, but the underlying assets are no longer available for immediate recourse and the secured creditor will need to contribute to the ----- general costs of the bankruptcy to be paid out of the proceeds realized by such a sale by the liquidator. If the proceeds of sale are insufficient to repay the debt owed to the secured creditor, the secured creditor will be treated as an unsecured creditor for the balance of its residual claims. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be setoff (verrekend) against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. Such set-off is allowed prior to the bankruptcy although a set-off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off. Consequently, Dutch bankruptcy laws could reduce your potential recovery in Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets, will be terminated by operation of law. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. In addition, under Dutch insolvency laws, the validity of an appointment of an agent for service of process granted by a Dutch company is uncertain. Furthermore, such appointments will terminate automatically in the case of an insolvency of the Dutch Guarantor. As such, the ability to bring suit against the Dutch Guarantor in the United States may be limited.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The beneficial holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to have the benefit of a secured claim, the security documents will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt, the security agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes.

The pre-insolvency plan,893.9.4,,"regime has been incorporated in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act pursuant to this Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, deactivation of certain _ipso facto_ clauses in contracts, and supporting court measures. The debtor and also creditors, shareholders or employee representation may take the initiative for a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans. Such composition may result in claims against the Dutch Guarantors as compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of such a composition and such composition is confirmed by Dutch courts. A composition plan under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of the Security Agent and/or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, voting on a composition plan is done in classes and creditors and shareholders with dissimilar rights are placed in different classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class ----- of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross class cramdown). Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) certain general grounds for refusal (e.g. procedural requirements have not been met, fraud, etc.), (ii) a request by an affected non-consenting creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (iii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors that have provided financing to the debtor (if so requested by such creditor(s)). If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay on enforcement (afkoelingsperiode) of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. During such stay on enforcement period, _inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge, unless with the court’s approval.

Portuguese insolvency laws may not be as favorable to your investments as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Portuguese insolvency law. Insolvency proceedings in Portugal may be initiated either by the debtor, a creditor or the Public Prosecutor (Ministerio Público) (representing entities which have their interests legally entrusted to it) when the debtor is deemed to be insolvent. Under Portuguese insolvency law, a debtor is deemed to be insolvent if it is unable to fulfill its debts as they fall due. A company will also be considered insolvent if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is significantly lower than the amount of its liabilities, according to the relevant accounting principles. Furthermore, although the main rule under Portuguese law is that insolvency is assessed on the existing factual situation, should the directors determine that the company will become insolvent in the near future, they can file for insolvency. Furthermore, the Portuguese Code on Insolvency and Recovery of Companies (CIRE) establishes that when facing a difficult economic situation or in the case of a merely imminent insolvency situation, the debtor may submit an application to court for a special proceeding of revitalization (PER). Additionally, the companies facing economic difficulties may also make use of the “Extrajudicial Regime of Companies´ Recovery” (“RERE”). This is an out-of-court process ----- managed by the Commercial Registry that aims at improving the conditions for reorganization of companies in deteriorated economic/financial structure still having the potential of being recovered. Finally, “Extraordinary Companies’ Viability Proceeding” (“PEVE”) is a temporary scheme created for businesses in financial difficulties and/or insolvent because of the economic and financial consequences of COVID-19. It is expected to remain in force until December 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

They do not include all the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020. The annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU. As required by the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the interim financial statements have been prepared applying the accounting policies and presentation that were applied in the preparation of the Company’s published consolidated annual report for the year ended 31 December 2020. The comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 are not the complete version of the Company’s statutory accounts for that financial year. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020 are available upon request from the Company’s registered office at Belvedere, 12 Booth Street, Manchester, M2 4AW or online at www.arrowglobalir.net. Those accounts have been reported on by the Company’s auditor and delivered to the registrar of companies. The report of the auditor: (i) was unqualified; (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report; and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. The interim financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than the fair value of derivative contracts and certain portfolio investments and the amortised cost accounting for other financial assets and liabilities. These interim financial statements were approved by the board of directors on 12 August 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

A base case forecast and several downside scenarios have been prepared reflecting the Group’s current financial position and expected future performance. Key items considered within each forecast were the future outlook for HPI and unemployment, including the length and severity of any potential macroeconomic shock, and the impact these may have on the Group’s cash flows. These cash flows were considered against the Group’s future liquidity position, taking into account that there are no bond maturities until 2024. Adherence to the Group’s liquidity, leverage and ERC loan to value covenants was also considered in all scenarios. The results of this scenario analysis show that even in a severe but plausible downside scenario, after taking reasonable management actions (such as cost reductions, slowing purchases and collection acceleration) as required, the Group is able to maintain sufficient liquidity and cash reserves to operate within banking covenants, and to continue as a going concern. This scenario was aligned to the severe downside forecasts outlined in note 10. F-7 ----- The directors have undertaken a thorough review of forecast cash flow models and scenarios for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of these accounts. These forecasts have been subject to stress testing, and downside scenarios have been considered including several hard-Brexit scenarios. This is set out in more detail in the statement of viability. In scenarios considered to be reasonable by management, as well as in a severe stress situation, after taking management actions as required, the Group maintains sufficient cash and banking covenant headroom to continue as a going concern. Following this review, and in the light of current cash availability, economic conditions and information available about future risks and uncertainties, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Basis of preparation (continued),893.57.1,,"Finally, a reverse stress test has also been prepared, incorporating a plausible set of management actions, to identify the magnitude of a downside stress that needs to occur to cause the group to breach its financial covenants. It has been concluded that this represents an overly severe and implausible scenario. The directors note the proposed acquisition by Sherwood Acquisitions Limited (a newly formed company owned by investment funds managed by TDR Capital LLP) (“Bidco”) to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the Parent Company and, in particular, the statements that Bidco has made in the Offer Documents regarding its intentions for the Group if that acquisition completes. In accordance with the Takeover Code, the Directors only have access to this publicly available information. The directors considered the impact of the proposed acquisition in the Group’s going concern assessment. They note that should the acquisition complete, Bidco’s stated intentions do not depart significantly from the Group’s existing strategy or present causes for concern that completion of the acquisition by Bidco would have an adverse effect on the ability of the Group and Parent Company to continue as a going concern. Based on all of the above indicators, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

When calculating the probability-weighted average for each country and asset class, the secured Base ERCs have been determined to most closely align to the ‘Stagnation’ macroeconomic scenarios. The forecasting methodology utilised for production of the unsecured Base ERCs, namely simulation methods, have an underlying assumption of a static macroeconomic environment, reflecting economic uncertainty rather than the anticipated macroeconomic improvements. To that end, the Group note that the unsecured Base ERCs have been produced using assumptions which are in the range between ‘Stagnation’ and ‘Base’ macroeconomic scenarios. Application of the probability-weighted average on this basis indicates an anticipated increase in the Base ERCs as a result of future macroeconomic scenarios. However, given the continuing relative macroeconomic uncertainty, no macroeconomic adjustment (increase) has been applied to the Base ERCs. F-13 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

However, it has been determined that contingent consideration liabilities qualify as level 3 financial liabilities held at FVTPL. As such, they are now included within this disclosure. The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using interest rate yield curves and forward foreign exchange rates prevailing at 31 December 2020. Total gains on portfolio investments recognised at FVTPL have been presented in the income statement as ‘Fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL’. The fair value of portfolio investments recognised as FVTPL has been calculated by using a discounted cash flow model. The significant unobservable inputs used in the calculation of portfolio investments categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy are estimated future cash flows (ERCs) derived from management forecasts and the discount rate appropriate to the investment and the anticipated rate of return. The total 84-month ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at FVTPL is £249,551,000, with an average discount rate of 13.1%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at FVTPL of £1,874,000/ (£1,874,000). An increase/decrease in the discount rate of 1% would lead to a decrease/increase in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at FVTPL of (£3,543,000)/£3,664,000. The total ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at amortised cost is £1,169,286,000, with an average discount rate of 21.5%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at amortised costs of £7,936,000/(£7,936,000). An increase/decrease in the discount rate of 1% would lead to a decrease/increase in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at amortised of (£12,192,000)/£12,636,000. A full reconciliation between the opening and closing portfolio investments held at FVTPL has been provided in note 24.

Financial instruments (continued),893.128.1,,"The fair value of amortised cost portfolio investments has been calculated by observing the compression in market yields over time and applying the difference between current average market IRRs for the Group’s most recent vintage and applying this as a premium or discount to prior years’ vintages. This approach takes into account changes in market pricing factors over time, while retaining the consideration of the individual characteristics of each portfolio. As this calculation is based on unobservable inputs, these fair values would be categorised as level 3 values. The fair value of portfolio investments has been calculated using a discounted cash flow model. The three main influencing factors in calculating this are: (i) estimated future cash flows, derived from management forecasts (ii) the application of an appropriate exit multiple (iii) discounting using a rate appropriate to the investment and the anticipated rate of return The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using interest rate yield curves and forward foreign exchange rates prevailing at 30 June 2021. The fair value of contingent consideration has been estimating the expected future payments arising from the consideration, and discounting this at Arrow’s weighted average cost of debt, as this is deemed to represent the rate at which the market prices the credit risk of the Group for such payables. The total 84-month ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at FVTPL is £343,998,000, with an average discount rate of 14.4%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at FVTPL of £2,393,000/(£2,393,000). An increase/decrease in the discount rate of 1% would lead to a decrease/increase in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at FVTPL of (£5,261,000)/£5,465,000. The total ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at amortised cost is £1,089,304,000, with an average discount rate of 21.7%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at amortised costs of £7,354,000/(£7,354,000).

The impact of COVID-19 related macroeconomic uncertainty has increased the level of judgement and estimation related to the measurement of portfolio investments. The areas where we identified heightened levels of judgement and estimation in the measurement of portfolio investments and therefore increased audit focus are: - **Model estimations – inherently judgemental modelling is used to estimate future cash flows. The assumptions used in the models include the probability and timing of expected future cash flows for each type of asset class within a portfolio or at a portfolio level. The Group adapted its cash-flow modelling in the year to respond to COVID-19 related macroeconomic uncertainty. - **Economic scenarios – significant judgement is applied to determine the economic scenarios used and the probability weighting assigned to each, particularly with COVID-19 related macroeconomic uncertainty. - **Collection strategy – the estimate of remaining cash collections are sensitive to changes in management’s strategy in managing the portfolios. - **Business plan assumptions – the estimation of remaining cash collections for each portfolio investment is underpinned by a business plan. Significant judgement and estimation is applied in determining a portfolio investment business plan, particularly in light of COVID-19 related macroeconomic uncertainty. The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that estimation of future cash collections from F-24 ----- The Group’s estimate of the remaining future cash collections (ERCs) from portfolio investments is the key variable in determining the portfolio carrying amount and any subsequent revenue adjustments. Portfolio investments comprise of amortised cost portfolios, fair value portfolios and real estate owned inventories. The Group uses cash flow forecasting models to calculate an initial estimate of future collections. The assumptions used in the models include the value, probability and timing of ERCs for each type of asset class within a portfolio or at a portfolio level. These estimates are subject to ongoing review by management to assess reasonableness, comparing observed performance against previous forecasts. Given the diverse nature of the Group’s Portfolio Investments, estimation of future cash collections for more bespoke assets involves a greater degree of management judgement. Dependent on the level of complexity of the asset, management use various forecasting models to derive the ERCs. The ERCs are most sensitive to management’s strategy in managing the portfolios (e.g. changes in collection policies or use of specialist collectors). Due to the level of subjectivity inherent in the assumptions used in the cash flow forecasting models this is a key judgement area for our audit. The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that estimation of future cash collections from Portfolio Investments has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole. F-115 Our procedures included: - **Controls design: We assessed the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls over data used in the cash flow forecasting models including monitoring of debt servicer collections, reconciliations of system cash collected to actual receipts, and general IT controls over the collection systems driving the estimated future cash flows; - **Governance controls: We assessed the design and implementation of approval controls such as the portfolio review committee that cover the outputs of the models and manual adjustments to inform the extent of our substantive testing. - **Methodology implementation: We assessed the methodology and implementation of the cash flow forecasting models used in valuing the portfolio investments, incorporating our own IT, modelling and valuation specialists to consider the appropriateness of the most significant models, review model code and challenge certain specific inputs into the forecasting models; - **Critical assessment of cash flows: Informed by our assessment of the controls and models noted above, we assessed the modelled cash flows by portfolio to identify those portfolios where more judgement may have been exercised (for example due to changes in approach by management to managing the portfolios) and/or where we consider greater risk may exist (for example due to under/overperformance against historic forecasts). Taking into account these risk factors and our cumulative audit experience, we undertook a risk based selection process to critically assess the cash flow forecasts and any manual adjustments made by the Group with reference to actual historic collections and our understanding of the Group; and - **Assessing transparency: We critically assessed the adequacy of the disclosures regarding the degree of estimation uncertainty involved in ----- On 8 April 2019, the Group acquired Drydens Limited in the UK for £10.2m, with the assets and liabilities purchased accounted for at fair value at the date of acquisition. The Group prepared the acquisition balance sheets based on its estimate of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. In particular, the Group prepared a discounted cash flow model to arrive at its estimates of the acquired intangible assets including customer contracts. This required the Group to exercise judgement in determining the expected cash flows from the assets and the discount rates to be applied.

Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations–ability to detect Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud,893.183.1,,"To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included: - Enquiring of Directors, the audit committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation to the Group’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group’s channel for “whistleblowing”, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; - Reading Board minutes and attending audit committee meetings; - Considering remuneration incentive scheme and performance targets for management; and - Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships. We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to full scope component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to full scope component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at Group. As required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets and our overall knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements. On this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition, with the exception of revenue earnt from portfolio investments, because the calculation of revenue is based on contractual terms and requires no judgement. We also identified a fraud risk in response to pressure to meet profit targets related to the measurement of expected cash collections for portfolio investments. In determining the audit procedures we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of some of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls.

As the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the entity’s procedures for complying with regulatory requirements. We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to full-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at Group. The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: data protection, anti-bribery, consumer protection and certain aspects of Company legislation, recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group’s activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach. We discussed with the audit committee matters related to actual or suspected breaches of laws or regulations, for which disclosure is not necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.

Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 crisis and its anticipated impacts on Estimated Remaining Collections (ERC), the Group has protected its liquidity and covenant position by raising additional funding and has renegotiated its financial covenants with its revolving credit facility lenders, as set out further in note 29. A base case forecast, and several downside scenarios, have been prepared reflecting the Group’s current financial position and expected future performance. Key items considered within each forecast were the future outlook for HPI and unemployment, including the length and severity of any potential macroeconomic shock, and the impact these may have on the Group’s cash flows. These cash flows were considered against the Group’s future liquidity position, taking into account that there are no bond maturities until 2024. Adherence to the Group’s liquidity, leverage and ERC loan-to-value covenants was also considered in all scenarios. The results of this scenario analysis show that even in a severe but plausible downside scenario, after taking reasonable management actions (such as cost reductions, slowing purchases and collection acceleration) as required, the Group is able to maintain sufficient liquidity and cash reserves to operate within banking covenants, and to continue as a going concern. This scenario was aligned to the severe downside forecasts outlined in note 24. Finally, a reverse stress test has also been prepared, incorporating a plausible set of management actions, to identify the magnitude of a downside stress that needs to occur to cause the group to breach its financial F-39 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are recognised in profit or loss. of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the monthly average exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve). When a foreign operation is disposed of in such a way that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation whilst still retaining control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. market rates of interest. The effective interest rate is also revised for fair value hedge adjustments at the date on which amortisation of the hedge adjustment begins. For financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis. For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, which includes all of the Group’s portfolio investments held at amortised cost, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. Subsequently, the carrying value of the portfolios is adjusted by updating future cash receipts and discounting them using the original credit adjusted effective interest rate with the subsequent remeasurement recognised as impairment through the statement of profit or loss. Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL. The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by analysing its borrowings from various external sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and - the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. The adjustment is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Group presents right-of-use assets in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘trade and other payables’ in the statement of financial position. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. No such elections have been made by the Group. All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or as at FVOCI as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. No such designations have been made by the Group. Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability. In transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset. In certain transactions, the Group retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The transferred asset is derecognised if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognised for the servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than adequate (liability) for performing the servicing. Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS Standards, or for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading activity. Financial instruments for which lifetime ECL are recognised and that are credit-impaired are referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial instruments’. expected to occur, then the Group immediately reclassifies the amount in the hedging reserve from OCI to profit or loss. For terminated hedging relationships, if the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is not reclassified until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss; if the hedged cash flows are expected to affect profit or loss in multiple reporting periods, then the Group reclassifies the amount in the hedging reserve from OCI to profit or loss on a straight-line basis. Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as it is incurred. Software, including IT platforms, is amortised on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over its estimated useful life, from the date on which it is available for use. The estimated useful life of software for the current and comparative periods is three to ten years. Amortisation is disclosed within other expenses within the statement of profit and loss. Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. a period of time where capital expenditure is being applied to the asset, such investments fall under the scope of IAS 2 – Inventories. In line with IAS 2, all assets classified as inventories are held at initial cost, plus any subsequent cost of capital expenditure. Such assets are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, but apart from this, no gain or loss will be taken on the value of the assets until the point at which they are sold, or partially sold. revenue streams, which relate to one performance obligation and contain a non-performance and performancerelated fee element. The non-performance element of the fee is recognised as the services are performed, with time elapsed being the measure of progress. Performance related fees are discussed below. Group’s cost of debt to bring it to its present value at the point of acquisition. An assessment is made at this point as to whether the payments constitute a post-employment benefit arrangement with former owners, or not. If this is not the case, the present value is included within the consideration paid to acquire the business and within goodwill, if relevant. Each period, the discount is unwound to the income statement as a finance cost, and the liability is remeasured to its current fair value at that point in time. _i. Loss of control_ When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. _ii. Transactions eliminated upon consolidation_ Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses (except for foreign currency transaction gains or losses) arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. When a foreign operation is disposed of in such a way that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation whilst still retaining control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, which includes all of the Group’s portfolio investments held at amortised cost, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL. The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by analysing its borrowings from various external sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and - the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. The adjustment is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Group presents right-of-use assets in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘trade and other payables’ in the statement of financial position. _ii. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_ The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, including leases of IT equipment. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. _iii. Policy applicable before 1 January 2019_ For contracts entered into before 1 January 2019, the Group determined whether the arrangement was or contained a lease based on the assessment of whether: - fulfilment of the arrangement was dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets; and - the arrangement had conveyed a right to use the asset. The Group did not have any finance leases under IAS 17. Assets held under other leases were classified as operating leases and were not recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position. Payments made under operating leases were recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received were recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease. _iv. Group acting as a lessor_ None of the arrangements which the Group has entered into have been determined to constitute the Group acting as a lessor under the definitions of IFRS 16. F-135 ----- - how managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and - the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised. The Group’s portfolio investments are comprised of various types of underlying credit positions. These investments are held by the Group for the primary purpose of collecting the underlying cash flows to the fullest extent possible. Sales of such portfolio investments are not a common occurrence and are not part of management’s strategy for such investments when they are purchased. _Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest_ For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers: - contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows; - leverage features; - prepayment and extension terms; - terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and - features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates). Equity and similar instruments have contractual cash flows that do not meet the SPPI criterion. Accordingly, all such financial assets are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI option is selected. recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability. If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as a derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument. _ii. Offsetting_ Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS Standards, or for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading activity. _iii. Fair value measurement_ ‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. When one is available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as ‘active’ if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the difference, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. The fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature (e.g. a demand deposit) is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be required to be paid. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. _iv. Impairment_ The Group recognises loss allowances for ECL on financial assets that are debt instruments, and that are not measured at FVTPL. No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments. The Group has not taken the low credit risk exemption for any of its financial assets. F-140 ----- The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for financial instruments (other than lease receivables) on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition (excluding credit-impaired assets), for which they are measured as 12-month ECL. 12-month ECL are the portion of lifetime ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which 12-month ECL are recognised are referred to as ‘Stage 1 financial instruments’. Financial instruments allocated to Stage 1 have not undergone a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and are not credit-impaired. Lifetime ECL are the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument or the maximum contractual period of exposure. Financial instruments for which lifetime ECL are recognised but that are not credit-impaired are referred to as ‘Stage 2 financial instruments’. Financial instruments allocated to Stage 2 are those that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but are not credit-impaired. Financial instruments for which lifetime ECL are recognised and that are credit-impaired are referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial instruments’. Expenditure on internally developed software, such as IT platforms, is recognised as an asset when the Group is able to demonstrate that the product is technically and commercially feasible, its intention and ability to complete the development and use the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits, and that it can reliably measure the costs to complete the development. The capitalised costs of internally developed software include all costs directly attributable to developing the software plus capitalised borrowing costs and are amortised over its useful life. Internally developed software is stated at capitalised cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as it is incurred. Software, including IT platforms, is amortised on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over its estimated useful life, from the date on which it is available for use. The estimated useful life of software for the current and comparative periods is three to ten years. Amortisation is disclosed within other expenses within the statement of profit and loss. Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. _ii. Customer intangibles_ When the Group acquires businesses which have material ongoing customer relationships, whether they are contractual or not, the principles of IFRS 3 dictate that the fair value of such customer relationships must be estimated and recognised on the balance sheet at the acquisition date. The impact of this is to effectively reduce the goodwill recognised on acquisition. Subsequent to the initial recognition of such assets, they are amortised over the expected life of the customer relationships with the Group. This amortisation is recognised within operating expenses. The useful lives and carrying values of customer intangibles are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. _iii. Goodwill_ Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. The Group has, for the period covered by these financial statements, made contributions to defined contribution plans to provide pension benefits for employees upon retirement, and otherwise, has no residual obligation or commitments in respect of any defined benefit scheme.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than purchased or originated creditimpaired assets, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not the expected credit loss (ECL). For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including ECL. This is the case for all the Group’s portfolio investments held at amortised cost, recognised since the introduction of IFRS 9. Additionally, for such assets, the future cash flows are forecast across the next 84 months following the balance sheet date. This is the point by which substantially all of the cash flows will have been received from a normal portfolio investment.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16. At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative standalone price. However, for leases of premises the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to premises. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the shorter of its useful economic life and the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if there is any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. When one is available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as ‘active’ if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the difference, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. The fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature (e.g. a demand deposit) is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be required to be paid.

Therefore, such infrequent sales activity is not deemed to invalidate the ‘hold to collect’ business model which the Group employs for the majority of its portfolios. Another judgement that has been made regarding the Group’s amortised cost portfolio assets is that they all fall within the POCI classification for IFRS 9 impairment measurement purposes. This judgement has been made by the Group, based upon the fact that historic purchase history and the current composition of the amortised cost portfolio investments shows that such assets tend to be bought at a point in time where they are credit impaired in some manner. This is supported by not only the nature of the assets, but by the fact that they are usually purchased at a deep discount, which is reflective of their incurred credit losses to date. For some portfolio investments, the SPPI criteria is not met, or there is an element of subordination within the holding structure. In such instances, these portfolio investments are held at FVTPL. Furthermore, some portfolio investments, such as those involving real estate, do not meet the definition of a financial instrument for accounting purposes. This leads to a portion of the Group’s portfolio investments being classified as ‘inventories’, under the scope of IAS 2. The Group’s co-investment alongside its Fund and Investment Management business is deemed to be held in a different business model than ‘hold to collect’, as these portfolios are managed primarily on a fair value basis, with reporting to senior management on the performance of these assets being prepared on that basis, and key management remuneration being linked to the performance of such assets on a fair value basis. As such, the business model of these assets has been judged to be neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. As such, the Group’s co-investment alongside its Fund and Investment Management business is classified as FVTPL.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued,893.335.1,,"investment in such entities is recognised as a single asset within the appropriate balance sheet classification, usually portfolio investments. Conversely, the Group also consolidates entities into its financial statements which it does not have 100% ownership of, but the Group is judged to control regardless. The judgement as to whether or not the Group has control over an entity is taken on a case-by-case basis by management, and is firstly based upon whether the Group can exercise any power over the relevant activities of the entity, and if this is the case, whether there is deemed to be a link between such power and the variability of the Group’s returns which arise from the entity. In many cases, the determination of control is clear. Cases where management must apply more judgement can occur where the Group holds a minority equity-level financial interest in a structured entity, as well as providing services to these entities in a typical supplier-customer relationship capacity. In these cases, the Group mainly assesses the relative share of marginal variable returns which flow to third parties versus the share which flows to the Group as a primary indicator of whether the Group is exercising any power it may have to influence the variable returns of the structured entity, either for its own benefit, or for the benefit of third parties in the structure. In the case of the former, the entity will usually be consolidated, whereas under the latter, the entity will usually not be consolidated. The portfolio-level ERC curves were then discounted at the appropriate rate (EIR for amortised cost portfolios, a rate reflective of assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset for FVTPL portfolios), to obtain the revised NPV and hence carrying value of the amortised cost and FVTPL portfolio investments. For REO portfolio investments, the revised ERC curve was used to determine the net realisable value in assessing each portfolio for potential impairment. Numerical disclosures and sensitivities have been set out in note 24, to assist the users of these statements in understanding the financial impact of the most recent reforecast. In addition to the scenario modelling set out above, another key judgement that has been applied by management is the probability weighting of each of these scenarios. The precise weightings used have been set out in note 24 and were based on management’s judgement on how each of its scenarios aligns to the macroeconomic forecasts provided by third party experts, as well as the view of local internal experts in the relevant geography and asset class. Such scenarios also take into account operational considerations that may impact balance sheet cash collections in each individual geography, such as the functioning of local court systems or property markets for example. The estimated future cash flows generated by the above process are the key estimate/judgement in these financial statements. Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by +1/-1% would impact the closing carrying value of the amortised cost and FVTPL portfolio investments as at 31 December 2020 by +/- £9,810,000 (2019: +/£11,020,000). The forecasting period over which ERCs are calculated is also a key estimate/judgement in these financial statements. Adding or removing six months to the cash flow forecasting period would increase/(reduce) the closing carrying value of the portfolio investments as at 31 December 2020 by £8,637,000/(£11,012,000) (2019: £12,453,000/(£17,326,000)). Note that there are a large number of inputs that are used to derive the ERC and hence the carrying value of portfolios. However, many of these are factual historical data points which do not individually involve significant estimation uncertainty, and as such, an overall combined sensitivity has been provided. Another judgement which has been made regarding the Group’s amortised cost portfolio assets is that they all fall within the POCI classification for IFRS 9 impairment measurement purposes. This judgement has been made by the Group, based upon the fact that historic purchase history and the current composition of the amortised cost portfolio investments shows that such assets tend to be bought at a point in time where they are credit impaired in some manner. This is supported by not only the nature of the assets, but by the fact that they are usually purchased at a deep discount, which is reflective of their incurred credit losses to date. _ii. Determination of control over investees_ Arrow holds an economic interest in a number of entities which it has been deemed to not control. As such, these entities are not consolidated into the Group’s financial statements, but rather, the investment in such entities is recognised as a single asset within the appropriate balance sheet classification, usually within portfolio investments. Conversely the Group also consolidates entities into its financial statements which it does not have 100% ownership of, but the Group has been judged to control such entities regardless. The judgement as to whether or not the Group has control over an entity is taken on a case-by-case basis by management, and is firstly based upon whether the Group can exercise any power over the relevant activities of the entity, and if this is the case, whether there is deemed to be a link between such power and the variability of the Group’s returns which arise from the entity. In many cases the determination of control is clear. Cases where management must apply more judgement can occur where the Group holds a minority equity-level financial interest in a structured entity, as well as providing various services to these entities in a typical supplier-customer relationship capacity. In these cases, the Group mainly assesses the relative share of marginal variable returns which flow to third-parties versus the share which flows to the Group as a primary indicator of whether the Group is exercising any power it may have to influence the variable returns of the structured entity primarily for its own benefit, or for the benefit of third-parties in the structure. In the case of the former fact pattern, the entity will usually be consolidated, whereas under the latter, the entity will usually not be consolidated. attributes. A further key model input is previous payments made by a customer. Additionally, estimates are made of the movement of accounts from non-paying to paying, and vice-versa, either through breakdown of the account or settlement/pay down of the balances due. In relation to non-paying accounts, assumptions will be made as to which operational strategy is the most appropriate to move the account to paying status, which may include placing these accounts into litigation. Operational factors that may impact future estimated ERCs are also considered, such as improved collections processes and systems. Management also review the model on a portfolio basis to take into account external factors, which have impacted historical, or will impact future performance and where necessary portfolios are calibrated to take into account these known factors. Known or estimated factors such as HPI increases/decreases, or planned litigation action are examples of key assumptions which are made that impact management’s forecast of ERCs. The assumptions and estimates made are specific to the particular characteristics of each portfolio. The ERCs created from the ERC forecasting models are regularly bench-marked at a portfolio level against actual performance, and this helps to inform the decision as to whether an impairment gain/loss may be required. Furthermore, with the introduction of IFRS 9 in 2018, ERCs also include specific consideration of multiple economic scenarios and the impact these are likely to have on collections in the future. For further information on this please see note 25. The estimated future cash flows generated by the above process are the key estimate/judgement in these financial statements. Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by +1/-1% would impact the closing carrying value of the amortised cost and FVTPL portfolio investments as at 31 December 2019 by +/- £11,020,000 (2018: +/£10,870,000). The forecasting period over which ERCs are calculated is also a key estimate/ judgement in these financial statements. Adding or removing six months to the cash flow forecasting period would increase/(reduce) the closing carrying value of the portfolio investments as at 31 December 2019 by £12,453,000/(£17,326,000) (2018: £13,796,000/(£16,360,000)). Note that there are a large number of inputs which are used to derive the ERC and hence the carrying value of portfolios. However, many of these are factual historical data points which do not individually involve significant estimation uncertainty, and as such, an overall combined sensitivity has been provided. _iii. Impairment assessment of goodwill balances_ The carrying amount of goodwill is £267,700,000 at 31 December 2019. In line with the Group’s accounting policies, the goodwill balance is assessed for impairment at each annual reporting date. The impairment assessment is carried out on a value in use basis, using discounted cash flow models for each cash generating unit (CGU) to determine whether the ongoing value in use of each CGU is higher than its carrying amount. No impairment was recognised as a result of the assessment performed as at 31 December 2019. This assessment is sensitive to the discount rate applied, and management’s forecast future cash flows for each CGU. Further information about the methodology applied and sensitivities to these factors are disclosed in note 13.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Carrying value of portfolio investments,893.336.1,,"The carrying value of portfolio investments is £1,042,215,000 at 31 December 2020 (2019: £1,163,624,000). The majority of these portfolio investments are measured at amortised cost. Given the speed and severity of the economic changes that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about, the Group has further refined the method by which ERCs and therefore portfolio valuations are calculated for the current accounting period. As at 31 December 2019, a bottom-up approach was taken whereby each individual portfolio’s cash flow has been modelled based on a number of factors, including balance sheet cash collections history and an array of data concerning the status of the individual loans within these portfolios, for example account-specific balance sheet cash collections history, account statuses, property statuses and valuations (for secured accounts), servicer history, and supporting data from third parties such as credit files or geo-demographics. This data has then been used in conjunction with the predicted effectiveness of any additional collection initiatives to forecast future balance sheet cash collections for each portfolio. These forecast balance sheet cash collections were then updated for balance sheet cash collections throughout 2020, before being used as the basis for the 31 December 2020 reforecast. Management believe the nature of the current crisis has caused a temporary dislocation in how future balance sheet cash collections will trend, based on balance sheet cash collections data to date. Accordingly, the Group has instead sought to determine how the anticipated more volatile macroeconomic environment will impact the bottom-up portfolio-level ERC forecasts, via a series of overlays, taking into account forecast future macroeconomic circumstances. To achieve this, each of the Group’s portfolios were first divided into a specified number of risk segments, with each segment containing loans of a similar nature (for example, UK unsecured loans). In addition, individually material and/or complex portfolios were also considered separately as their own ‘segment’. For each segment, for the most relevant macroeconomic indicators, a range of possible future outcomes was forecast, each representing either an upside, downside or severe downside scenario. The impact of each scenario on the Group’s future cash flows was determined in conjunction with the Group’s internal experts in the relevant segment, considering both past experience and knowledge about the current condition of the local environment. Using statistical methods, a probability was also assigned to each segment-level scenario, giving consideration to updated external macroeconomic forecasts, balance sheet cash collections performance throughout the year and local in-house knowledge. These probabilities assigned were then used to calculate a probability-weighted ERC change for each segment, save for a small number of individual portfolios in which management judgement was applied. The weighted segment-level adjustments were then applied to each portfolio within each respective segment to allow the production of portfolio-level ERC curves. F-59 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Fair value of net assets acquired as part of business combinations,893.339.1,,"The Group capitalises goodwill on the acquisition of entities as discussed in the significant accounting policies. Goodwill is the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. Therefore the fair value of assets acquired directly impacts the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired portfolio investments and customer intangibles where valuations reflect estimates of amounts and timing of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities.

The Group recognises revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation related to a service it has undertaken to provide to a customer. Servicing income makes up the majority of AMS income, and in itself comprises a broad range of services, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realisation, legal title holding, due diligence activities, initial platform migration and on-boarding activities, securitisation vehicle set-up and ongoing management activities, new origination activities, litigation and court process management and third-party sub-servicer management. In all material cases, the services are provided at a point in time that corresponds to the satisfaction of the related performance obligations. As such, revenue arising from servicing income is normally recognised as the services are provided to the customer, with no deferral or acceleration of revenue across the life of the contract.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The only impact foreseen is an increase in withholding tax (WHT) suffered on the payment of interest and/or dividends from Portugal and Italy. Any WHT suffered is expected to be fully creditable in the UK, with no cash tax impact from an overall group perspective (other than for timing purposes). _Uncertainty over income tax treatments_ The current tax liability of £2,110,000 represents the amount of income taxes payable in respect of current and prior year periods, including a provision in relation to uncertain tax positions. F-68 ----- As for most multi-nationals, the current tax environment is creating increasing levels of uncertainty and the Group is potentially subject to tax audits in many jurisdictions. By their nature, these are often complex and could take a significant period of time to be agreed with the tax authorities. The Group estimates and accrues taxes that will ultimately be payable when reviews or audits by tax authorities of tax returns are completed. The levels of risk arising from tax audits may change as a result of legislative change, tax authority guidance or practice and correspondence with the tax authorities during a specific audit. It is not possible to quantify the impact that such future developments may have on the tax positions taken in the financial statements. _Uncertainty over income tax treatments_ The current tax liability of £7,645,000 represents the amount of income taxes payable in respect of current and prior year periods, including a provision in relation to uncertain tax positions.

The UK Government enacted legislation for the rate to remain at 19% and deferred tax recognised in the UK has been restated accordingly, with a credit of £305,000 reflected during the year ended 31 December 2020. In December 2019, a new corporate tax law was enacted in the Netherlands. Consequently, as of 1 January 2020, the corporate tax rate in the Netherlands will be reduced from 25% to 21.7%. This change resulted in a gain of €1,147,000 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group’s Dutch subsidiaries being recognised during the year ended 31 December 2019. In September 2020, the Dutch Government announced the reversal of this planned decrease, maintaining the rate at 25%.

Although the UK Government has announced its intention to pass revised legislation under which the rate would remain at 19%, no legislation has been introduced at the balance sheet date and therefore deferred tax balances in relation to the UK have been calculated using a rate of 17%. In December 2019, a new corporate tax law was enacted in the Netherlands. Consequently, as of 1 January 2020, the corporate tax rate in the Netherlands will be reduced from 25% to 21.7%.

The UK losses arose in the current period as a result of an impairment of portfolio balances due to COVID-19. The underlying profitability of the Group has remained, and such losses are expected to be utilised against future taxable profits. The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £2,864,000 (2019: £2,634,000) of tax losses carried forward, due to uncertainties over the future utilisation of the losses, including the future profitability of the relevant subsidiaries. These losses may be available for offset against future profits and have no expiry date. There are no unrecognised deferred tax liabilities. The rate of UK corporation tax is expected to increase to 25% from 1 April 2023. Deferred taxation is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date. As noted above, there is a significant UK deferred tax asset in relation to losses carried forward, the restatement of which is expected to generate a statement of profit and loss tax credit once the applicable legislation has been substantially enacted.

Goodwill continued,893.383.1,,"Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to four aggregated CGUs on the basis that these represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and are not larger than the single operating segment defined under IFRS 8 (Operating Segments). An impairment review was carried out at 31 December 2020 that resulted in no impairment to goodwill. The goodwill was assessed to be appropriately stated. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value, less cost to sell and value in use.

The UK and Ireland, Portugal, Benelux, and Italy CGUs, represent the cash flows generated principally from collections on acquired portfolio investments and management and servicing of third-party debt. Given the structure and operating model of the Group, it has been deemed appropriate to combine a number of CGUs for impairment testing purposes. This is in line with the Group’s stated strategy of providing a range of services in each geographic region in which the Group operates and represents the lowest level at which the Group’s resources and assets are allocated internally. The discount rate was a post-tax rate based on the yield of average European 10-year government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities generally and the systemic risk of the specific CGU. Five years of cash flows were included in the discounted cash flow model. A long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of the nominal gross domestic product rates for the countries in which the CGU operates and the long-term compound annual profit before taxes, depreciation and amortisation growth rate estimated by management. Budgeted profit before taxes, depreciation and amortisation were based on expectations of future outcomes taking into account past experience, adjusted for the anticipated revenue growth. Revenue growth was projected taking into account the average growth levels experienced over the past five years and the estimated growth for the next five years.

Post-tax rates are used alongside post-tax cash flows, as the post-tax discount rate is more readily derived from observable market information. Any potential differences between post-tax discount rates and cash flows and the pre-tax method under IAS 36 – Impairment of assets have been considered, and no material differences between approaches have been identified. The starting point for determining the discount rates for each CGU was to use the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and adjust this for specific factors for each of the CGUs to derive a market participant’s rate. The factors took into account the risks inherent in each of the CGUs; such as currency, regulatory, and economic risks and the different operations in the CGUs were also considered. In determining the appropriate WACC to use in the current impairment test, in line with advice from experts, management took into account both the current and target leverage structure of the Group, as well as pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 market conditions. An average of these approaches provided a balanced view of the appropriate discount rate to use for the value in use calculation in the midst of the uncertainty created by COVID-19. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity. The forecasts assume growth rates in collection activity which in turn drive forecast collections and cost figures. These assumptions are in keeping with the directors’ expectations of future growth. Appropriate tax rates are applied to the cash flow forecasts for each CGU. The analysis has been prepared using post-tax cash flows and discount rates, as post-tax discount rates can be more readily derived from observable market data. The Group is satisfied that this is materially equal to performing the analysis on pre-tax cash flows and discount rates. The result of the goodwill impairment review was that no impairment was deemed to exist as at 31 December 2020. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis over the key inputs used in the impairment test of the CGU’s carrying value.

In the current period, the movement in this balance relate primarily to interest being charged on the loan. Balances relate to intercompany loans that are repayable on demand, with this being the longest contractual period and are, therefore, held as current liabilities or assets. As a loan repayable on demand, expected credit losses were estimated on the assumption that repayment of the loan is demanded at the reporting date. It was assessed that loan was not in default as (i) the repayment had not been demanded, and (ii) the subsidiary was considered to be performing. The maximum period over which expected impairment losses were measured was the period needed to transfer the cash once demanded. As at 31 December 2020, Arrow Global One Limited could repay the outstanding balance of the receivable in full within three months, with the majority of the payment being received immediately. Accordingly there is no material expected credit loss. During the year, there were no other related party transactions other than discussed above. F-78 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

This leads to a change in the classification of the portfolio investment held. The ‘portfolio restructure’ represents the restructure of a leveraged structured deal to move to a de-levered position, and hence change the nature of the holding whilst extinguishing related liabilities. Note that for real estate inventories, which are not financial instruments, the balance sheet cash collections figure above is analogous to total sales of inventories, and the net of balance sheet cash collections and income from portfolio investments – real estate inventories, is analogous to cost of sales of inventories. Sales of inventories are accounted for as revenue under IFRS 15, as they are not financial instruments, but are presented alongside the other portfolio investments for ease of reference.

Additionally, the Group incorporates forward-looking information in the measurement of portfolio investments held at amortised cost. The Group formulates three economic scenarios: a base case, which is the central scenario, developed based on consensus forecasts, and two less likely scenarios – one upside and one downside scenario. These scenarios are calculated by an external and independent macroeconomic forecasting company and are reviewed internally before being used in the Group’s models. To derive these scenarios, multiple sources of information are considered, including economic data and forecasts published by governmental bodies and monetary authorities in the countries where the Group operates, supranational organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund, and selected private-sector and academic forecasts. The Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk for its portfolio investments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses. The key drivers for credit risk for portfolio investments are: HPI’s and unemployment rates, with all countries using the international labour organisation definition across countries. For exposures to specific regions, the key drivers also include relevant real estate prices.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

In addition, the Group maintains agreed lines of credit with other banks. For more detail on the cash and cash equivalents re-presentation, see note 31 on page F-112. The non-derivative financial liabilities and financial assets are calculated based upon the undiscounted cash flows, which include estimated interest payments. The analysis above includes the contractual cash flow for borrowings and the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan. Where borrowings are subject to a floating rate, an estimate of interest payable is taken. The rate is derived from interest rate yield curves at the statement of financial position date. Within 1 year £000 1-2 years £000 Total £000 Company As at 31 December 2020 Less than 1 month £000 3-5 years £000 More than 5 years £000 When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined with reference to the projected interest rates as illustrated by the interest rate yield curves existing at the statement of financial position date. The derivative financial instruments are held across a number of counterparties; the largest net cash flow exposure to a single counterparty at 31 December 2020 is £0.03 million (2019: £0.2 million). This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: - the change in market interest rates occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and/or derivative financial instruments; - where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging instruments it is assumed that there is no impact from a change in interest rates; and - changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments. If foreign exchange rates had been 10% weaker than Sterling than those at the statement of financial position date and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s net assets and net profit for each significant denomination of currency would increase as follows: 2019 £000 Equity and net assets 2020 £000 Currency Euro (EUR) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **(17,555) (17,493) **(17,555) (17,493)** 2019 £000 Net profit 2020 £000 Currency Euro (EUR) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **(244)** (8,018) (244)** (8,018) The above assumes that there is no impact on retained earnings or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged (where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability). inception. Subsequently, any changes in lifetime ECL after initial recognition are recognised in profit or loss. The ECL calculation for POCI assets is based on an ECL over 84 months. In determining ECLs the assessment of forward-looking economic assumptions, which are sourced from an independent specialist forecasting company, the Group considers a number of macroeconomic scenarios, including assumptions on unemployment, interest rates and CPI, and where appropriate HPI. These scenarios are probability weighted according to their likely occurrence. The scenarios include a central scenario, based on the current economic environment, as well as upside and downside scenarios. The estimation and application of this forward-looking information requires significant judgement and is subject to appropriate internal governance. Impairment gains/losses are changes to carrying values, discounted at the EIR rate, of the acquired debt portfolios as a result of reassessments of their estimated future cash flows and are recognised in the line item ‘impairment gains on portfolio investments at amortised cost’. As all of the Group’s amortised cost portfolio assets are POCI, the cash flows are subject to reassessment each period. For any portfolios which may be sold to a third-party from time to time, these are first subject to a cash flow reassessment. Expected cash flows in such a scenario would be linked to the likely sale proceeds, meaning that all such assets would be written to their expected selling price via an impairment gain/loss, before being sold.

Expected credit losses (ECL) against POCI exposures are always calculated on a lifetime basis (cumulative changes in ECL since initial recognition), and are reflected in the credit-adjusted effective interest rate at initial recognition. As a result, no loss allowance is recognised at inception. Subsequently, any changes in lifetime ECL after initial recognition are recognised in profit or loss. The ECL calculation for POCI assets is based on an ECL over 84-months. In determining ECLs, the assessment of forward-looking economic assumptions, which are sourced from an independent specialist forecasting company, the Group considers a number of macroeconomic scenarios, including assumptions on unemployment, interest rates and CPI, and where appropriate, HPI. These scenarios are probability weighted according to their likely occurrence. The scenarios include a central scenario, based on the current economic environment, as well as upside and downside scenarios. The estimation and application of this forward-looking information requires significant judgement and is subject to appropriate internal governance. Impairment gains/losses are changes to carrying values, discounted at the EIR rate, of the acquired debt portfolios as a result of reassessments of their estimated future cash flows and are recognised in the line item ‘impairment gains on portfolio investments at amortised cost’. There are generally no credit risk mitigants relating to the Group’s unsecured portfolio investments. As all of the Group’s amortised cost portfolio assets are POCI, the cash flows are subject to reassessment each period. For any portfolios that may be sold to a third party from time to time, these are first subject to a cash flow reassessment. Expected cash flows in such a scenario would be linked to the likely sale proceeds, meaning that all such assets would be written to their expected selling price via an impairment gain/loss, before being sold. The following tables sets out information about the credit quality of financial assets measured at amortised cost. Unless specifically indicated the amounts in the table represent gross carrying amounts. The Group’s purchased portfolio investments have been classified as purchased or originated as credit impaired (POCI) as they include financial instruments that were credit-impaired at initial recognition, irrespective of whether they are still credit-impaired at the reporting date.

As this calculation is based on unobservable inputs, these fair values would be categorised as level 3 values. The primary unobservable input to which this valuation is sensitive to is the current market rates for portfolios. A 1% rise/fall in this rate would lead to an uplift/reduction in fair value of £20,251,000/(£19,438,000). The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and the revolving credit facility are deemed to be equal to their carrying amount, and is considered a level 1 fair value. The carrying value of other receivables and payables classified as financial assets/liabilities is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value, due to their short maturity and low credit risk. These would be considered as a level 3 fair values. The carrying value of asset-backed loans is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value. Given the significant collateral underpinning the asset-backed loans, it is deemed appropriate to not adjust the carrying value for expected credit losses when deriving the fair value of the loans. Additionally, the market rate is not deemed to have materially changed since the issuance of the asset-backed loans. The fair value would be categorised as a level 3 value. The fair value of the senior secured notes has been calculated by reference to broker quotes that are based on observable market inputs and therefore would be included as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy table should the liability have been held at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value, which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the derivative transaction. For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value. Total gains on portfolio investments recognised at FVTPL have been presented in the income statement as ‘Fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL’. The fair value of portfolio investments recognised as FVTPL has been calculated by using a discounted cash flow model. The significant unobservable inputs used in the calculation of portfolio investments categorised as Level 3 In the fair value hierarchy are estimated future cash flows (ERCs), derived from management forecasts and the discount rate appropriate to the investment and the anticipated rate of return. The total 84 month ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at FVTPL is £255,844,000, with an average discount rate of 12.4%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at FVTPL of £1,698,000/ (£1,698,000). An increase/decrease in the discount rate of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at FVTPL of (£5,325,000)/£5,637,000. The total ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at amortised cost is ££1,428,163,000, with an average discount rate of 22.9%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at amortised costs of £9,322,000/(£9,322,000). An increase/decrease in the discount rate of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at amortised of (£14,114,000)/£14,613,000. A full reconciliation between the opening and closing portfolio investments held at FVTPL has been provided in note 24. For a fuller description of how the future cash flows are estimated, please refer to note 4. (2018: £1,202,000) was recycled from equity to the statement of profit or loss, within finance costs, and other comprehensive income as a result of maturity of the short dated foreign exchange swaps during the year and an amount of £100,000 has been charged to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2018: £291,000). 2018 £000 swaps are categorised as highly effective and no charge has been made to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the year (2018: no charge). No re-classifications into or out of the hedging reserve were made in relation to interest rate swaps. The Company did not hold any interest rate swaps at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: £nil). No charge has been made to the Company’s equity. The calculation methodology of Euribor changed during 2019. In July 2019, the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to Euribor under the European Union Benchmarks Regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use Euribor after 1 January 2020 for both existing and new contracts. The Group expects that Euribor will continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future. The Group does not anticipate changing the hedged risk to a different benchmark. For these reasons, the Group does not consider its cash flow hedges of the Euribor benchmark interest rate to be directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform at 31 December 2019. No hedge relationships have any exposure to LIBOR. At 31 December 2019, the Group held the following instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates.

The Group has an established control framework covering the measurement of portfolio investment carrying values. This includes regular monitoring of portfolio performance overseen by the portfolio review committee, which considers actual versus forecast results at an individual portfolio level, re-forecasts cash flows on a semiannual basis, reviews actual against forecast gross money multiple, approves the latest ERC forecast, assesses the carrying value of the portfolio assets and reviews revenue recognition.

In 2019 and 2020, these interest rate swaps covered current borrowings, being the floating rate senior secured Euro notes. An amount of £427,000 has been credited to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2019: £286,000 credit). All hedge relationships have been effective in the year and are expected to maintain effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is assessed based upon the relative changes in cash flows arising from the specified portion of the Group’s floating rate borrowings, relative to the change in cash flows of the interest rate swaps (using the hypothetical derivative method). The hedges are deemed to be highly effective in the current and prior period. In such hedge relationships, the main source of potential hedge ineffectiveness is counterparty credit risk, of both parties, including the Group. There are no other material sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Interest rate swaps in place at the statement of financial position date are designated, and are effective under IFRS 9, as cash flow hedges, and their fair value has been recognised in the hedging reserve. All interest rate swaps are categorised as highly effective and no ineffectiveness charge has been made to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the year (2019: no charge). No re-classifications into or out of the hedging reserve were made in relation to interest rate swaps. The Company did not hold any interest rate swaps at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: £nil). The interest payable and receivable under the interest rate swaps are expenses directly to the statement of profit and loss and no charge has been made to the Company’s equity. The calculation methodology of Euribor changed during 2019. In July 2019, the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to Euribor under the European Union Benchmarks Regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use Euribor after 1 January 2020 for both existing and new contracts. The Group expects that Euribor will continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future. The Group does not anticipate changing the hedged risk to a different benchmark. For these reasons, the Group does not consider its cash flow hedges of the Euribor benchmark interest rate to be directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform at 31 December 2020. No hedge relationships have any exposure to LIBOR. At 31 December 2020, the Group held the following instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates. 2020 2019 Interest rate risk Less than 1 year 1-5 years Less than 1 year 1-5 years",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The total undiscounted consideration for the acquisition is £11,115,000 including deferred and contingent consideration.

Of the £4,262,000 contingent consideration the gross undiscounted amounts are made up as follows: - Up to £2,000,000 is contingent upon the successful migration of Arrow accounts. The payment range could be anywhere between £nil and £2,000,000 with the final amount to be agreed upon in April 2020; - Up to £2,000,000 is contingent upon the performance of Arrow placed accounts against the jointly agreed business plan.

We have nothing to report on going concern,893.617.1,,"The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Company or the Group or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Company’s and the Group’s financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”). Our responsibility is to conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ conclusions and, had there been a material uncertainty related to going concern, to make reference to that in this audit report. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of reference to a material uncertainty in this auditor’s report is not a guarantee that the Group and the Company will continue in operation. In our evaluation of the Directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks to the Group’s and Company’s business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and Company’s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risk that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group’s and Company’s available financial resources over this period was significant reduction of cash collections due to macroeconomic slow down impacting the Group’s ability to comply with financing covenants. As this was a risk that could potentially cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we considered sensitivities over the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group’s financial forecasts taking account of reasonably possible (but not unrealistic) adverse effects that could arise from these risks individually and collectively and evaluated the achievability of the actions the Directors consider they would take to improve the position should the risks materialise. Based on this work, we are required to report to you if: - we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in Note 3 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; or - the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 102 of the 2019 Annual Report is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge.

Respective responsibilities,893.622.1,,"_Directors’ responsibilities_ As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 103 of the 2019 Annual Report, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. _Auditor’s responsibilities_ Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. _Irregularities – ability to detect_ We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at group level. The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. Firstly, the group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group’s licence to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: anti-bribery, employment law, certain aspects of company legislation and customer conduct, recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group’s activities and its legal form. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence. Through these procedures, we became aware of actual or suspected non-compliance and considered the effect as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. The identified actual or suspected non-compliance was not sufficiently significant to our audit to result in our response being identified as a key audit matter. Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.

As lessee, under IFRS 16, in respect of leased properties previously accounted for as operating leases the Group now recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Payments associated with leases with a lease term of twelve months or less and leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis.

Given the low number of investors who are required to act together to remove the Group as Fund manager without cause, despite the Group’s aggregate economic interest is some cases being above 30% (depending on which items are included/excluded), the Group has concluded that it acts as agent for the investors in all cases, and therefore has not consolidated these funds.

Effective interest rate_ Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to: - the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or - the amortised cost of the financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than purchased or originated creditimpaired assets, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not ECL. For purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including ECL. This is the case for all the Group’s portfolio investments held at amortised cost, recognised since the introduction of IFRS 9. Additionally, for such assets, the future cash flows are forecast across the next 84 months following the balance sheet date. This is the point by which substantially all of the cash flows will have been received from a normal portfolio investment, and the point at which the Group is comfortable in forecasting to. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability, such as legal and due diligence fees. _ii. Amortised cost and gross carrying amount_ The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation, using the effective interest method, of any difference between that initial amount and the expected cash flows and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance. The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance. However, for amortised cost portfolio assets the concept of a separable expected credit loss allowance is not applied, because due to the nature of the portfolio assets, expected cash flows are forecast including an estimate of expected credit losses, including multiple economic scenarios. _iii. Calculation of interest income and expense_ The effective interest rate of a financial asset or financial liability is calculated on initial recognition. In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. The effective interest rate is revised as a result of periodic re-estimation of cash flows of floating-rate instruments to reflect movements in market rates of interest. The effective interest rate is also revised for fair value hedge adjustments at the date on which amortisation of the hedge adjustment begins. For financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis. F-133 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The details of accounting policies under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 are disclosed separately. _i. Group acting as a leasee_ Policy applicable from 1 January 2019 At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16. This policy is applied to contracts entered into (or changed) on, or after 1 January 2019. At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative standalone price. However, for leases of premises the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to premises. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the shorter of its useful economic life and the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. F-134 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Significant accounting policies continued Taxation,893.677.1,,"_i. Income tax_ Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in OCI. The Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore has accounted for them under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and has recognised the related expenses in ‘other expenses’. _ii. Current tax_ Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. _iii. Deferred tax asset_ Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for: - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if there is any. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For this purpose, the carrying amount of investment property measured at fair value is presumed to be recovered through sale, and the Group has not rebutted this presumption. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. F-136 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Recognition and initial measurement_ The Group initially recognises portfolio investments, debt securities issued and other financial liabilities on the date on which they are acquired. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) are recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. The fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is generally its transaction price. _ii. Classification_ Financial assets On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. No such elections have been made by the Group. All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or as at FVOCI as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: - significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; - a breach of contract such as a default or past-due event; - the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise; - it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or - the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The amount recognised in the hedging reserve is reclassified from OCI to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss, and in the same line item in the statement of profit or loss and OCI. If the hedging derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, or the hedge designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. However, if the derivative is novated to a CCP by both parties as a consequence of laws or regulations without changes in its terms except for those that are necessary for the novation, then the derivative is not considered expired or terminated. If the hedged cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the Group immediately reclassifies the amount in the hedging reserve from OCI to profit or loss. For terminated hedging relationships, if the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is not reclassified until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss; if the hedged cash flows are expected to affect profit or loss in multiple reporting periods, then the Group reclassifies the amount in the hedging reserve from OCI to profit or loss on a straight-line basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The grant date fair value of the share-based payment granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payments with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.

Fair value of net assets acquired as part of business combinations_ The Group capitalises goodwill on the acquisition of entities as discussed in the significant accounting policies. Goodwill is the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. Therefore the fair value of assets acquired directly impacts the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired portfolio investments and customer intangibles where valuations reflect estimates of amounts and timing of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities.

Typically, these forecasts cover an 84-month period, except in the case of a number of FVTPL portfolios where it is necessary to forecast cash flows over a 120-month period to capture all of the material cash flows. The 84-month period is deemed to be the most appropriate time frame over which expected cash flows are measured, as this is the point that modelling accuracy begins to fall below a supportable threshold.

(1,367) (686) — — (2,053) (1,367) (686) 222,331 40 220,318 The material receivable balance due from subsidiary undertakings from Arrow Global One Limited relates primarily to final dividends declared by Arrow Global One Limited in 2018. In the current period, the movement in this balance relate primarily to the partial settlement in cash of this receivable. Balances relate to intercompany loans that are repayable on demand and are therefore held as current liabilities or assets. No ‘other’ transactions occurred between the related parties, excluding those disclosed above. As a loan repayable on demand, expected credit losses were estimated on the assumption that repayment of the loan is demanded at the reporting date. It was assessed that loan was not in default as (i) the repayment had not been demanded, and (ii) the subsidiary was considered to be performing. The maximum period over which expected impairment losses were measured was the period needed to transfer the cash once demanded. As at 31 December 2019, Arrow Global One Limited could repay the outstanding balance of the receivable within six months, with the majority of the payment being received immediately. Therefore, the expected credit loss was limited to the effect of discounting the amount due on the balance over this period. As the expected repayment schedule is short, discounting at the receivable’s effective interest rate did not result in a material expected credit loss. During the year there were no other related party transactions other than discussed above. F-166 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

Additionally, the Group incorporates forward looking information in the measurement of portfolio investments held at amortised cost. The Group formulates six economic scenarios: a base case, which is the central scenario, developed based on consensus forecasts, and five less likely scenarios – two upside, one stagnation and two downside scenarios. These scenarios are calculated by an external and independent macroeconomic forecasting company, and are reviewed internally before being used in the Group’s models. To derive these scenarios, multiple sources of information are considered, including economic data and forecasts published by governmental bodies and monetary authorities in the countries where the Group operates, supranational organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund, and selected private-sector and academic forecasts. The Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk for its portfolio investments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses. The key drivers for credit risk for portfolio investments are: CPI growth, price indices, unemployment rates and interest rates. For exposures to specific regions, the key drivers also include relevant real estate prices. The Group estimates each key driver for credit risk over the active forecast period of four years. This is followed by a period of mean reversion of three years. A limitation of the approach which has been taken by the Group in estimating the impact of multiple economic scenarios is that the correlations between macro-economic variables and credit risk have been calculated using UK macro-economic data and UK historic portfolio performance but applied to the wider population of amortised cost portfolios held across Europe. The exception to this is in Portugal for secured assets, where specific correlations between Portuguese HPI and credit risk have been calculated and used. Despite such limitations, the Group believes that this approach provides a materially correct estimate of the impact of future economic scenarios across the Group.

Treasury activities and compliance with treasury policies are reported to the board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external. Treasury policies are designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding and liquidity risks, counterparty credit risk and market risks being interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. This is to ensure the Group is properly funded, that financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality and that interest rate and currency risks are managed within set limits. Policies also set out the specific instruments that can be used for risk management. The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.

Following acquisition, the fair value will move directionally in line with carrying amount but may deviate as market conditions change. The Group has an established control framework covering the measurement of portfolio investment carrying values. This includes regular monitoring of portfolio performance overseen by the portfolio review committee, which considers actual versus forecast results at an individual portfolio level, re-forecasts cash flows on a semiannual basis, reviews actual against forecast gross money multiple, approves the latest ERC forecast, assesses the carrying value of the portfolio assets and reviews revenue recognition. A reconciliation of the opening to closing balances for the year of the portfolio investments can be seen in note 24.

In 2018 and 2019, these interest rate swaps covered current borrowings, being the floating rate senior secured Euro notes. An amount of £286,000 has been credited to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2018: £291,000 charge). All hedge relationships have been effective in the year and are expected to maintain effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is assessed based upon the relative changes in cash flows arising from the specified portion of the Group’s floating rate borrowings, relative to the change in cash flows of the interest rate swaps (using the hypothetical derivative method). The hedges are deemed to be highly effective in the current and prior period. In such hedge relationships, the main source of potential hedge ineffectiveness is counterparty credit risk, of both parties, including the Group. There are no other material sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Interest rate swaps in place at the statement of financial position date are designated, and are effective under IFRS 9, as cash flow hedges, and their fair value has been recognised in the hedging reserve.

On the same dates, tax-qualifying options were granted as part of the LTIP awards (‘CSOP options’) to eligible UK employees. Each CSOP option is subject to the same performance targets as apply to the nil-cost option part of the awards. If a CSOP option is exercised at a gain, the number of shares that may be delivered under the above associated nil-cost option under the LTIP will be reduced at exercise by the same value to ensure that the total pre-tax value of the original LTIP award delivered to the participant is not increased by the grant of the CSOP option. Awards granted on or after 27 June 2018 awards do not include the right to receive a dividend equivalent.",N/A,as_expected,2021,842

The gross contractual outstanding amounts of ‘trade and other receivables’ was materially equal to their carrying amount, with no material balances not expected to be collected upon. In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2018, Parr Credit contributed income of £13,900,000 and a loss after tax contribution of £2,100,000 to the consolidated results for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018, Group total income would have been higher by an estimated £2,600,000 and profit after tax would have been lower by an estimated £400,000. _b. Europa Investimenti S.p.A (EI)_ On 13 September 2018, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of EI. EI originates and manages Italian distressed debt investments. The acquisition builds on the 2017 acquisition of Zenith, and subsequent acquisition of Parr Credit in 2018, providing a platform to drive returns from corporate and SME assets. The total undiscounted consideration for the acquisition is €69,500,000 (£62,092,000) including deferred and contingent consideration. Contingent consideration is payable in one tranche. It is included at its fair value, at the maximum amount contractually agreed. The contingent consideration is based on the business meeting certain cumulative income targets by the end of 2022.

(5,280) 26,436 Goodwill of €53,972,000 (£48,219,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reason for the acquisition was to create scale and servicing capabilities across multiple asset classes in the Italian market following the purchase of Zenith in 2017 and Parr in 2018. The gross contractual outstanding amounts of ‘trade and other receivables’ was materially equal to their carrying amount, with no material balances not expected to be collected upon. In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2018, EI contributed income of £13,600,000 and profit after tax contribution of £6,500,000 to the consolidated results for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018, Group total income and profit after tax would not have been materially different at £361,796,000 and £29,969,000 respectively, due to the majority of EI’s 2018 deals closing in the period since acquisition. _c. Norfin Investimentos S.A. (Norfin)_ On 21 December 2018, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Norfin. Norfin manages real estate investments in Portugal. The acquisition allows the Group to offer a comprehensive set of servicing solutions to investors in Portugal. The total undiscounted consideration for the acquisition is €43,100,000 (£38,731,000) including expected contingent consideration. Contingent consideration is split into two tranches and is based upon the funds under management (FUM) growth and margins achieved in the business by the end of 2020. If such targets are met, a share of the FUM over the performance threshold will be paid as contingent consideration in the first half of 2021.

(2,471) 13,974 An intangible asset of €2,301,000 (£2,068,000) has been recognised at acquisition, being the fair value after appropriate discounting, of expected cash flows arising from existing customer relationships. Goodwill of €34,644,000 (£31,335,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the offering of servicing solutions from the Group to investors in Portugal. The gross contractual outstanding amounts of ‘trade and other receivables’ was materially equal to their carrying amount, with no material balances not expected to be collected upon. In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2018, Norfin did not contribute any material income or profit after tax to the 2018 Group result. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018, Group total income would have been higher by an estimated £5,900,000 and profit after tax would have been an estimated £500,000 higher. _d. Bergen Capital Management Limited (Bergen)_ On 1 July 2018, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Bergen. Bergen manages corporate real estate secured loans. The acquisition provides the Group with additional servicing capabilities in this asset class in the UK. The total undiscounted consideration for the acquisition is £5,200,000.
